            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if CACI International at around US$597 per share still offers value, or if most of the opportunity has already been reflected in the price?</li> <li>The stock has had a mixed recent run, with a 1% gain over the last 7 days, a 7.2% decline over 30 days, an 11.1% return year to date, and a 77.9% return over the past year, following a 102.4% return over 3 years and 175.8% over 5 years.</li> <li>These moves have kept CACI on many investors' watchlists, as they reassess what is already priced in and what might still be up for debate.

Analysts have provided forecasts that feed into a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with Simply Wall St extending the projections further out. Within that framework, projected Free Cash Flow for 2035 is $1,014.98 million, based on a mix of analyst inputs and extrapolated estimates.</p> <p>When all those forecast cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of around $812.41 per share. Versus a recent share price near $597, this suggests the stock is trading at roughly a 26.5% discount to that DCF estimate. On this cash flow based approach, the model result indicates that CACI may be undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CACI International is undervalued by 26.5%.

It reflects both what the market thinks of those earnings today and how it is weighing the risks around them.</p> <p>Higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk usually support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tend to pull a “normal” or “fair” P/E lower. CACI International currently trades on a P/E of about 25.4x. That sits above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x, but below the peer group average of around 28.0x.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for CACI is 27.2x, which is its proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E might be given the company’s earnings characteristics, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This can be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for factors that can differ meaningfully between companies. With the current P/E of 25.4x sitting modestly below the Fair Ratio of 27.2x, the multiple suggests the stock may be undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-caci/caci-international/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1429557d-de3e-47fa-b954-56434f5f9dd9/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

For you as a shareholder, the timing matters because management is pairing the dividend move with a larger buyback authorization and a 10 year gas sales contract to a Midwest power plant, which together point to confidence in future cash generation and demand visibility.

The key questions are whether the company keeps covering the dividend and buybacks from cash generated, how liquids stay above 30% of production as guided, and whether the Midwest contract meaningfully affects realized pricing. It is also worth tracking any changes in analyst views on the stock, given the recent cluster of Hold ratings and target tweaks, to see if this capital return move changes perceptions of risk and return.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Range Resources, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/RRC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Range Resources</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For your watchlist, the combination of a new entertainment product and a shift in ship positioning provides additional data points on how CCL is positioning its brand and fleet in key cruise markets.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-ccl/carnival-corporation/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carnival Corporation &amp;</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

For you, that sits alongside price changes to gratuities and beverage packages as part of a broader focus on onboard yield.

The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis. In the very near term, the key catalyst is the upcoming Q4 2025 earnings release, while the biggest risk remains a sharp correction in charter rates if trade routes normalize or demand softens.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement to this dividend is the declared timetable for Q4 2025 results on March 5, 2026, which now lands just one day before the payout date. That puts the dividend, capital return story, and fresh earnings data right next to each other on the calendar, potentially sharpening investor focus on how effectively Global Ship Lease is turning its contracted backlog and recent fleet additions into sustainable free cash flow and ongoing shareholder distributions.</p> <p>But against this backdrop, investors should also be aware of the risk that tighter environmental rules could force costly upgrades or early scrapping of older ships...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-gsl/global-ship-lease/foinmbvw-midsize-container-ships-will-improve-efficiency-despite-market-headwinds-fx8t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Global Ship Lease (it's free!)</a></p><p>Global Ship Lease's narrative projects $621.0 million revenue and $270.6 million earnings by 2028.

An ESOP related shelf registration is directly related to that discussion, since equity based incentives can be a key part of how healthcare providers seek to retain and motivate staff. For shareholders, the filing is a structural update that sits alongside broader industry attention on workforce stability and care quality.</p> <p>For investors, key considerations include how much stock might eventually be issued under this shelf, over what timeframe, and on what terms employees gain access. The filing establishes a framework rather than an immediate transaction, so the specifics of future issuances, potential dilution, and any capital raising that may be associated with ESOP funding could be important to monitor as PACS Group develops this plan.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-pacs/pacs-group/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PACS Group</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the recent turnaround can point to Q2 to Q4 basic EPS between roughly US$1.01 and US$2.19 as evidence that profitability has held above early 2024 levels in recent quarters.</li> <li>The longer term decline in earnings growth rate, despite the strong trailing 12 month print, shows the bullish story is relying heavily on the latest year rather than a multi year pattern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong recent profits sit next to a weaker multi year track record, and that tension is exactly what many investors are trying to weigh up right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/INVA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Innoviva.</strong></a></p> <h2>One off gain inflates 65.9% margin</h2> <ul> <li>The reported 65.9% trailing net profit margin is much higher than the 6.5% margin a year earlier, and the data attributes a US$161.6 million one off gain as a key factor, so a large slice of the margin is tied to a single item rather than repeatable operations.</li> <li>Critics highlight that the very large year over year earnings improvement, described as more than a tenfold jump, is hard to treat as a new normal when:\n    <ul> <li>The one off gain of US$161.6 million fed directly into the trailing 12 month net income of US$271.2 million, which means a material portion of that profit is non recurring.</li> <li>The same data set shows analysts expecting earnings to decline by about 0.8% per year over the next three years, so the bearish view is that the spike in margins does not line up with the more muted outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>“Cheap” 6.5x P/E versus 19.9x industry</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$23.54, the trailing P/E of 6.5x sits well below both the reported US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.9x and a peer average of 17.7x, while the DCF fair value cited for Innoviva is US$53.96, which is much higher than the current price.</li> <li>What is interesting for the more cautious, bearish narrative is that this discount exists alongside softer longer term earnings trends and forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Earnings across the last five years declined at about 22.1% per year, even though the most recent trailing 12 month period shows very strong profit, so the low P/E is being judged on a high earnings base that includes a large one off gain.</li> <li>Revenue is forecast to grow at 9.5% per year, slightly below the 10.4% reference rate for the US market, which bears use to argue that the apparent valuation gap may be partly explained by more modest growth expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are weighing that low 6.5x P/E against the earnings record and forecasts, the community discussion is a helpful next step. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

However, the 90-day share price return shows a 5.09% decline, which contrasts with a 1-year total shareholder return of 142.68%.

Yet the market is assigning a premium that suggests investors are heavily focused on future growth potential and the aPAP opportunity rather than today’s financials.</p> <p>That premium also stands out against peers. Savara’s 15.6x P/B is described as expensive versus both the US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x and a peer average of 12.1x, implying the market is paying a significantly richer multiple than is typical for the space.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 15.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the risk that the company remains loss making, with net income of $115.645m in the red and no current revenue base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Savara narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>With sentiment clearly split between the risks and the potential upside, it makes sense to act now and review the numbers for yourself, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If you are serious about sharpening your watchlist, do not stop at one stock story, use the Simply Wall St screener to uncover ideas you might otherwise miss.</p> <ul> <li>Spot potential value opportunities early by scanning companies on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> list that pair quality fundamentals with prices that may not fully reflect them.</li> <li>Strengthen your defensive side by reviewing companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> that score well on stability and downside protection.</li> <li>Get ahead of the crowd by checking the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undiscovered_gems\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473622/high-quality-undiscovered-gems/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">screener containing 24 high quality undiscovered gems</a> where strong fundamentals have yet to attract broad attention.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That 28.3% earnings growth compares to a 5 year compound rate of 3.3%.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this kind of earnings acceleration supports a stronger long term story, yet the data creates a mixed picture:\n    <ul> <li>The 28.3% trailing earnings growth and higher 2.5% margin line up with the bullish view that better efficiency and mix can support higher profitability over time.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus and bullish scenarios are still only assuming earnings growth in the low to mid single digits each year, which is much closer to the older 3.3% 5 year trend than to the most recent year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, that gap between the one year surge and the slower 5 year pace is exactly what bullish investors are debating in their forecasts for Ahold Delhaize, and it is unpacked further in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/nzlb4xbk-demographic-shifts-and-digital-expansion-will-create-lasting-value-sdn5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Steady quarterly EPS with same store sales around 3%</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly EPS stayed in a tight band between €0.60 and €0.65 while reported same store sales growth was 3.3% in Q1, 4.0% in Q2, 2.9% in Q3 and 3.2% on a trailing twelve month basis.</li> <li>Bears point out that this kind of mid single digit same store sales and stable EPS ties in with their concern about limited top line momentum:\n    <ul> <li>Forecasts for revenue growth of about 2.3% a year and earnings growth of about 4.4% a year are not far from what this same store sales range suggests and are slower than the Dutch market forecasts of 9.6% for revenue and 12.4% for earnings.</li> <li>This helps the bearish side argue that even with stable quarterly EPS today, future growth may be constrained by mature markets and rising competition in areas like online grocery and discount formats.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who see those growth forecasts as a ceiling rather than a floor are building their case around this slower profile, and you can see that laid out clearly in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/89uf5o5x-digital-competition-will-erode-market-share-and-raise-costs-6h5d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation gap and slower growth vs Dutch market</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 16.4x versus a peer average of 28.1x and an industry average of 18.8x.

For investors, a shelf registration like this often sits in the background until management decides conditions are suitable to issue securities. It does not commit the company to raise funds, but it sets up the framework to do so efficiently.</p> <p>This filing indicates that management is seeking flexibility to respond if funding needs, acquisition opportunities, or regulatory capital requirements arise. The key thing to monitor is how, when, and in what form NasdaqGS:PFG eventually uses this capacity, because equity, debt, or hybrid offerings can affect the risk profile and potential returns in different ways.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nasdaq-pfg/principal-financial-group/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Principal Financial Group</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

The stock trades at $26.3, with a 7.2% gain over the past five years but a 1 year return of an 18% decline and a 3 year return of a 4.7% decline, which points to a bumpier recent stretch. Those mixed results help explain why new developments on rates, regulation, and expenses matter so much at the moment.</p> <p>The key questions center on how much relief potential Fed rate cuts might provide against rising insurance, tax, and compliance costs, and how regulators ultimately shape the rules for large owners of single family rentals.

Same-store core revenue growth guidance of 1.3% to 2.5% for 2026 indicates that management is not assuming aggressive rent growth, even though 2025 revenue, net income, and earnings per share were higher than the prior year. The completed US$100.05m buyback, covering 0.59% of shares, also adds context for recent investor activity by indicating that the company has been returning capital while investors trade the stock on interest-rate expectations.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Invitation Homes Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Measured 2026 same-store revenue growth guidance and recent earnings support the narrative that steady rental demand and operational efficiency can underpin long-term earnings for a large single-family rental owner.</li> <li>Soft pricing on new leases and rising operating expenses challenge the idea that Sun Belt and suburban markets automatically translate into strong rent growth and expanding margins.</li> <li>The scale of recent share repurchases and the impact of regulatory scrutiny on future acquisition-driven growth are not fully captured in the narrative and could influence how investors think about portfolio expansion versus capital returns.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/4lj7ec1o-analysts-adjust-invitation-homes-price-targets-amid-sector-reassessment-and-modest-valuation-changes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Invitation Homes</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Analysts highlight that earnings are forecast to decline by an average of 2% per year over the next 3 years, which could limit support for a high P/E if growth expectations reset.</li> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which can matter more for a rate-sensitive REIT if borrowing costs do not ease as quickly as some investors expect.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings grew by 29.5% over the past year, giving investors a recent track record of profit growth to weigh against more cautious forward expectations.</li> <li>🎁 The stock is described as trading at 41.9% below one estimate of fair value, which some investors may see as room for upside if the single-family rental model remains resilient versus peers such as American Homes 4 Rent and Tricon Residential.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how Invitation Homes converts its 1.3% to 2.5% same-store core revenue growth target into cash flow after higher insurance, taxes, and maintenance, as well as how renewal rent trends compare with weaker new-lease pricing. Fed policy decisions and any change in commentary around institutional ownership of single-family homes could influence both borrowing costs and sentiment.

This backdrop helps explain why the share price has seen both shorter term weakness and stronger multi year returns as sentiment has shifted over time.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, CorMedix scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>.

Analysts provide specific Free Cash Flow estimates for the coming years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path. On this basis, projected Free Cash Flow reaches $209.8 million in 2030, with additional years beyond that also modeled in millions of US dollars.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $91.95 per share. Compared to the recent share price of US$7.35, this suggests the stock is 92.0% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CorMedix is undervalued by 92.0%.

It helps you compare CorMedix with other businesses that also generate earnings in the same sector.</p> <p>A higher or lower P/E often reflects what the market expects for future growth and how risky those earnings might be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk can justify a lower one.</p> <p>CorMedix currently trades on a P/E of 3.56x. That is below the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.89x and below the peer average of 9.43x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” for CorMedix of 15.70x, which is an estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for growth characteristics, risk and profitability instead of assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. When you compare CorMedix’s current P/E of 3.56x with the Fair Ratio of 15.70x, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you compare that Fair Value with today’s price and decide if CorMedix at, say, a more bullish US$22.00 view or a more cautious US$14.00 view is closer to your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CorMedix? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/CRMD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $39.24 million. Looking ahead, analysts have Innodata generating free cash flow of $27.35 million in 2026, with further annual projections out to 2035 extrapolated from those inputs by Simply Wall St rather than based on direct analyst estimates.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $12.53 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$47.58, this implies the stock is 279.8% above the DCF estimate, which indicates the market is placing a much higher value on Innodata than this cash flow based approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Innodata may be overvalued by 279.8%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"INOD Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>INOD Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Innodata.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Innodata Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful shorthand for how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of earnings. It ties directly to the bottom line, which is ultimately what supports a share price over time.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E often reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Innodata currently trades on a P/E of about 45.1x. That is above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x and also above the peer average of about 21.8x, so on simple comparisons the stock carries a premium.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Innodata is 27.2x. This proprietary metric is designed to estimate a P/E that fits the company’s own profile, including its earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than just lining it up against broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 27.2x with the actual P/E of 45.1x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story about Innodata, link that story to explicit forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform turns it into a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price on the Community page used by millions of investors. Each Narrative updates automatically when new news or earnings land, so you can quickly see how a more optimistic view, such as a Fair Value around US$110.00, stacks up against a more cautious view closer to US$80.00. You can then decide for yourself whether Innodata looks closer to a buy, a hold or a sell for your own approach.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Innodata? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/INOD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The Average Return on Equity used is 13.75%, against a Cost of Equity of $1.08 per share. The difference between what the bank is expected to earn and what investors require, the Excess Return, is $1.05 per share.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value is set at $15.51 per share, using weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. These inputs are combined in the Excess Returns framework to arrive at an intrinsic value estimate of about $44.95 per share.</p> <p>Comparing this to the current share price of $33.45 indicates the stock is about 25.6% undervalued according to this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests First Financial Bankshares is undervalued by 25.6%.

It is widely used because it links directly to the earnings that ultimately support dividends and retained capital.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E partly reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually comes with a lower P/E.</p> <p>First Financial Bankshares currently trades on a P/E of 18.77x. That sits above the Banks industry average of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.98x, which on simple comparisons can make the shares look relatively expensive. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might be reasonable given factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. For First Financial Bankshares, the Fair Ratio is 12.72x, which is meaningfully below the current 18.77x and suggests the shares trade richer than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, you can set up a Narrative for First Financial Bankshares that connects what you believe about its business to a financial forecast and a fair value, then compare that fair value to the current price to help you decide whether it looks attractive or not right now. Narratives are easy to adjust and are updated when new information like news or earnings arrives, so your view does not stay stuck on old data. For example, one investor might see First Financial Bankshares as worth well above today’s price while another might see it as worth well below, and those different fair values sit side by side on the platform so you can judge which story you find more convincing.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for First Financial Bankshares? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FFIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
