The latest earnings beat and return to profitability strengthen the case that scale and higher storage attachment can support margins, but the biggest near term swing factor is still access to affordable capital, while long term policy uncertainty around incentives remains a key overhang. This quarter’s results do not remove those risks, but they do improve Sunrun’s financial footing.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is Sunrun’s completion of the PG&amp;E Local PeakShift Power season, where over 1,000 customer systems delivered nearly 1,200 hours of highly accurate dispatch. Paired with storage attachment rates reaching 71% by year end 2025, this grid services performance gives more substance to the idea that batteries and virtual power plants could become a meaningful earnings driver, potentially offsetting some pressure from expiring tax credits and higher financing costs over time.</p> <p>Yet while the profit rebound is encouraging, investors should also be aware that concentrated policy risk around solar tax credits could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunrun (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunrun's narrative projects $2.9 billion revenue and $465.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunrun's forecasts yield a $22.74 fair value</a>, a 11% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa2a4c7-de78-47ca-906e-c5edae8a6116/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this surprise profit, the most bearish analysts assumed almost flat revenue growth near US$2.1 billion and no profitability, so their far more cautious view of Sunrun’s financing and policy risks may shift meaningfully as investors reassess those assumptions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Sunrun</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $343.7 million. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2030, with free cash flow projections moving from a loss of $146 million in 2026 and $13 million in 2027, to positive cash flows of $143 million in 2028, $231 million in 2029 and $313 million in 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates further free cash flow estimates out to 2035 using its own growth assumptions.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $23.63 per share. Compared with the recent share price around $3.79, this implies the stock is about 84.0% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iovance Biotherapeutics is undervalued by 84.0%.

Slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower one. That is why it helps to look at Iovance Biotherapeutics in the context of both its industry and its own fundamentals.</p> <p>Iovance Biotherapeutics currently trades on a P/S of 5.93x. This sits below the Biotechs industry average of 12.58x and also below the peer average of 6.82x provided. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the company is 4.19x, which is an estimate of the P/S multiple that might be reasonable given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Compared with simple peer or industry comparisons, the Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored to the company’s profile.</p> <p>Putting that together, Iovance Biotherapeutics’ actual P/S of 5.93x is above the Fair Ratio of 4.19x, which points to the shares pricing in a richer multiple than this framework suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/af2848b1-cfd3-42ac-adb3-fafd0b7d60eb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This allows you to compare that fair value with the current share price to help decide if the stock looks attractive or stretched on your assumptions.</p> <p>Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as company announcements, earnings or analyst revisions appear, you are not locked into a static view. You can quickly see how fresh data shifts the fair value output linked to your story.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, one investor might build a cautious Narrative anchored around a US$1.00 fair value while another might build an optimistic Narrative around US$20.00. By setting out the revenue, earnings and P/E assumptions behind each, you can decide which version feels closer to your own view or adjust the inputs to create something in between.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Iovance Biotherapeutics Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/13svd0s7-amtagvi-and-new-til-will-meet-aging-global-demand?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$17.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 78% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 56.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes Amtagvi adoption, broader patient access, and efficiency gains support higher revenue and a turnaround from losses to profit over the next few years.</li> <li>Builds in a higher profit margin and a future P/E of 75.10x, which is well above the current US Biotechs industry P/E referenced earlier in the article.</li> <li>Anchors on a Fair Value of US$17.00, based on bullish analyst assumptions for revenue of US$1.0b and earnings of US$126.3m by 2028, discounted back at about 7.11%.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/jv6qnzu7-rising-interest-rates-and-dilution-will-stifle-til-progress?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$2.00 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 89% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 43.28% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes slower commercialization, high costs, complex distribution, and pressure from drug pricing scrutiny and interest rates, with continued execution risk.</li> <li>Uses a lower profit margin of 3.20% and a future P/E of 50.65x, while still baking in material revenue growth from Amtagvi and the pipeline.</li> <li>Arrives at a Fair Value of US$2.00 per share, reflecting a cautious view that the market may be pricing in more growth and profitability than these assumptions support.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame the recent US$3.79 share price between a bullish fair value of US$17.00 and a bearish fair value of US$2.00.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Sysmex shares are now priced attractively or still have further to fall, this article walks through what the current share price might be implying about the company's value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at ¥1,467, after a 9.6% move over the past 7 days, a modest 0.3% return over 30 days, and longer term returns of a 4.4% decline year to date, a 44.9% decline over 1 year, a 45.0% decline over 3 years, and a 58.1% decline over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Sysmex has focused on its position in the healthcare sector and how investors are reassessing companies in this space, especially those with established products and global reach. This backdrop helps frame why the share price has shifted recently and why some investors are rechecking their assumptions about what a fair price looks like today.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Sysmex currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>, meaning it screens as undervalued on half of the metrics we track.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is ¥27,423.60 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations point to projected free cash flow of ¥50,425.75 million by the year ending March 2030, with a series of annual projections between now and 2035 that Simply Wall St has discounted back to today.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are added and discounted, the model arrives at an estimated fair value of ¥1,567.57 per share. Compared with the recent market price of ¥1,467, the DCF output implies Sysmex trades at about a 6.4% discount to this estimate, which places it in the “roughly in line” bucket rather than looking extremely cheap or expensive.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Sysmex is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

When investors expect stronger growth or see lower risk, they are usually willing to accept a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower P/E.</p> <p>Sysmex currently trades on a P/E of 20.4x. That is close to the Medical Equipment industry average of 15.5x and very similar to the peer average of 20.5x, so on simple comparisons the stock looks roughly in line with similar names rather than clearly cheap or expensive.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might make sense for Sysmex given its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk factors. This is more tailored than a straight peer or industry comparison because those benchmarks do not adjust for company specific strengths or weaknesses. For Sysmex, the Fair Ratio is 26.6x, which is higher than the current 20.4x P/E, suggesting the shares trade below this estimate of fair value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You will often see very different takes on Sysmex. For example, one Narrative might assume a much higher fair value than today’s price, while another assumes a much lower one, reflecting different expectations for its future.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Sysmex? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/6869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $39.24 million. Looking ahead, analysts have Innodata generating free cash flow of $27.35 million in 2026, with further annual projections out to 2035 extrapolated from those inputs by Simply Wall St rather than based on direct analyst estimates.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $12.53 per share.

It ties directly to the bottom line, which is ultimately what supports a share price over time.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E often reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Innodata currently trades on a P/E of about 45.1x. That is above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x and also above the peer average of about 21.8x, so on simple comparisons the stock carries a premium.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Innodata is 27.2x. This proprietary metric is designed to estimate a P/E that fits the company’s own profile, including its earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than just lining it up against broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 27.2x with the actual P/E of 45.1x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story about Innodata, link that story to explicit forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform turns it into a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price on the Community page used by millions of investors. Each Narrative updates automatically when new news or earnings land, so you can quickly see how a more optimistic view, such as a Fair Value around US$110.00, stacks up against a more cautious view closer to US$80.00. You can then decide for yourself whether Innodata looks closer to a buy, a hold or a sell for your own approach.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Innodata? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/INOD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This context is important when you look at a share price that has shorter term gains alongside weaker multi year returns.</li> <li>On our checks, First Financial Bankshares has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 out of 6</a>.

The Average Return on Equity used is 13.75%, against a Cost of Equity of $1.08 per share. The difference between what the bank is expected to earn and what investors require, the Excess Return, is $1.05 per share.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value is set at $15.51 per share, using weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. These inputs are combined in the Excess Returns framework to arrive at an intrinsic value estimate of about $44.95 per share.</p> <p>Comparing this to the current share price of $33.45 indicates the stock is about 25.6% undervalued according to this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests First Financial Bankshares is undervalued by 25.6%.

It is widely used because it links directly to the earnings that ultimately support dividends and retained capital.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E partly reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually comes with a lower P/E.</p> <p>First Financial Bankshares currently trades on a P/E of 18.77x. That sits above the Banks industry average of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.98x, which on simple comparisons can make the shares look relatively expensive. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might be reasonable given factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. For First Financial Bankshares, the Fair Ratio is 12.72x, which is meaningfully below the current 18.77x and suggests the shares trade richer than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, you can set up a Narrative for First Financial Bankshares that connects what you believe about its business to a financial forecast and a fair value, then compare that fair value to the current price to help you decide whether it looks attractive or not right now. Narratives are easy to adjust and are updated when new information like news or earnings arrives, so your view does not stay stuck on old data. For example, one investor might see First Financial Bankshares as worth well above today’s price while another might see it as worth well below, and those different fair values sit side by side on the platform so you can judge which story you find more convincing.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for First Financial Bankshares? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FFIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

With margins now framed by a higher reported net margin and a large one off loss in the background, the latest print puts the focus firmly on how durable that profitability profile really is.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/real-estate-management-and-development/hkg-14/hysan-development-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Hysan Development.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the table, the next step is to see how these results line up against the key narratives around growth, risk, and income that have been shaping expectations for Hysan Development.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/mz19jazy-14-consistent-outlook-will-sustain-momentum-amid-stability-in-core-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Hysan Development</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/real-estate-management-and-development/hkg-14/hysan-development-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:14 Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a012acf1-f3a5-4e13-bc90-fc88e1b130c6/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:14 Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>HK$900m one off swings margin picture</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month net income excluding extra items sits at HK$840 million on HK$3,464 million of revenue, and that comes alongside a HK$900 million one off loss that materially shaped the reported 24.2% net margin versus 1.1% last year.</li> <li>Bulls argue that projects like Lee Garden Eight and the wider Lee Gardens ecosystem can support higher recurring rental income and margins. However, the size of that HK$900 million item and the move from a loss of HK$317 million in the prior 12 months to HK$840 million now means part of the earnings jump reflects clean up effects rather than just ongoing rental strength.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to data driven loyalty programs and curated retail that are already linked with higher tenant sales and traffic, but these sit beside a period where basic EPS on a trailing basis moved from HK$0.03 to HK$0.31 with help from that one off adjustment.</li> <li>If you are leaning toward the bullish story, it is worth separating what comes from steady HK$3,326 million to HK$3,551 million revenue over the last few reported periods and what is tied to that HK$900 million event.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E premium and 21.2% earnings growth forecast</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of HK$21.82, the trailing P/E of 26.7x sits well above both peers at 14.2x and the wider Hong Kong real estate industry at 14.4x, while earnings are forecast to grow about 21.2% per year and revenue is forecast at 3.7% annual growth versus 8.6% for the market.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to a business that could lift earnings meaningfully over time, but the combination of a P/E almost double peer levels and revenue growth forecasts that trail the broader market invites questions about how much of that 21.2% earnings growth is already reflected in today’s HK$21.82 price.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts are effectively assuming stronger margins can do the heavy lifting, while the DCF fair value of HK$11.15 sits well below the current price, which suggests the market is comfortable paying up based on those margin assumptions.</li> <li>If you prefer to stress test that view, you might compare the current premium multiple and DCF fair value gap with what you would expect given revenue growth that is below the 8.6% market forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On a strong earnings growth story priced at a 26.7x P/E, some investors want to see exactly how bullish analysts think this can go before they decide how to weigh that premium. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1c6fv52l-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hysan Development Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Debt coverage and dividend pressure</h2> <ul> <li>The company offers a 4.95% dividend yield, yet dividends are flagged as not well covered by earnings and debt is described as not well covered by operating cash flow, which makes the balance sheet a key watchpoint alongside the income stream.</li> <li>Bears highlight that weaker debt coverage and reliance on instruments like perpetual securities can leave less headroom if rental conditions stay tough, and the data here backs their focus because cash flow coverage of debt and dividend payout are both identified as pressure points rather than strengths.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also note that while trailing margins look strong at 24.2%, that sits beside concerns about refinancing costs and the need to keep funding projects like Lee Garden Eight and other developments.</li> <li>If you are weighing the cautious view, the combination of a near 5% yield, limited earnings cover, and flagged debt coverage risk gives you a clear list of financial items to track in the next few reporting periods.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> When dividends are not well covered and debt coverage is marked out as a risk, some investors prefer to walk through the cautious case in detail before committing fresh capital. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/40zdes1c-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hysan Development Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/mz19jazy-14-consistent-outlook-will-sustain-momentum-amid-stability-in-core-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Hysan Development on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Reading through this, you can probably sense both enthusiasm and caution in the story.

Short term, the key catalysts remain earnings delivery against the updated FY2025/26 guidance, the recently increased dividends, and how the market continues to price a low P/E against modest growth forecasts. The Ishikariwan Shinko Unit 2 acceleration fits into this by modestly reinforcing the investment story around supply stability, but it also underscores the ongoing need for heavy capex in a business where debt is not well covered by operating cash flow and dividend cover looks tight. Given the already strong share price gains, this project tweak looks more incremental than transformational to the near term risk‑reward.</p> However, investors should be aware of how rising capex could strain cash generation and dividends.\n\nHokkaido Electric Power Company's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 35%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c387b43e-a10f-4156-b065-ce343cad1687/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value estimate from the Simply Wall St Community centers tightly around ¥909.82 per share, contrasting with recent market pricing.

On one hand, HP outperformed expectations on both revenue and EPS, with net revenue of US$14.4b compared to US$13.5b a year earlier and non GAAP EPS above consensus. On the other, operating income fell and management is guiding toward the lower end of its full year earnings ranges as DRAM and NAND costs pressure margins. That combination often leads to short term share price weakness, which you are already seeing. However, it also gives you clearer information on how management plans to handle higher input costs through product re configuration, supplier diversification and selective price increases. The fact that HP maintained its fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS range of US$2.47 to US$2.77 while outlining a US$1b cost savings plan suggests management is trying to balance investment in AI PCs with disciplined capital returns, including US$0.6b returned in Q1 and continued buybacks. Against a backdrop of insider share sales and mixed institutional flows, this quarter is likely to be read as a test of whether HP can convert strong AI PC demand into durable earnings power rather than just a one off beat.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The HP Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The strong Q1, with AI PCs at more than one third of shipments and Personal Systems growth, supports the narrative that AI driven PCs and premium devices can underpin revenue and margin resilience.</li> <li>The sharp rise in memory costs and guidance toward the low end of EPS ranges challenges the view that cost restructuring alone can fully offset input cost pressure and structural headwinds in Print.</li> <li>The specific memory cost inflation and the US$1b mitigation plan through FY2028 add more detail on cost risks and timing that are only partially reflected in the existing narrative about restructuring and supply chain diversification.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/9fda6tiy-ai-demand-and-margin-pressures-will-shape-performance-amid-digital-sector-shifts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for HP</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Rising DRAM and NAND prices are creating a roughly US$0.30 full year EPS headwind, which could keep Personal Systems margins below the long term range if mitigation falls short.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts and risk models highlight four key risk factors, including negative shareholders’ equity and concerns around dividend stability and leverage, which may limit how aggressive HP can be with buybacks and payouts.</li> <li>🎁 AI PCs already account for over 35% of shipments, supporting the view that HP can benefit if the PC refresh cycle and demand for higher spec devices continue to support the Personal Systems segment.</li> <li>🎁 Management is pursuing US$1b in gross run rate savings by FY2028 and has continued to return capital through buybacks and dividends, which some investors may see as supportive of per share metrics if executed carefully.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, how quickly memory cost inflation stabilises or is offset through supplier agreements, product design changes and pricing. Second, whether AI PC growth remains strong enough to support revenue and operating margins, especially compared with peers like Dell, Lenovo and Apple in higher end PCs. Third, how capital allocation evolves, including the pace of buybacks after repurchasing 13.3m shares in the latest quarter and any shift in dividend policy, given the balance sheet risk indicators. Insider trading patterns and institutional positioning can also give you extra context on how other market participants are reacting to these moving pieces.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for HP, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HPQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for HP</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
