This puts new numbers around how the business is performing today and what management expects next.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for FTI Consulting.</a></p> <p>The 5.1% 1 day share price return after the results, with the stock now at $168.11, comes after a mixed few months where a 30 day share price decline of 8.1% contrasts with a modestly positive 1 year total shareholder return of 2.0%. This suggests recent trading momentum has picked up as investors react to the earnings beat and 2026 guidance.</p> <p>If these earnings have you thinking about where professional services and technology intersect, it could be a good moment to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 top founder-led companies</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With FTI Consulting posting higher quarterly sales and diluted EPS alongside 2026 guidance that points to more revenue and earnings, you now have to ask yourself whether there is still upside here or whether the market is already pricing in that growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 5.3% Undervalued</h2> <p>With FTI Consulting closing at $168.11 against a narrative fair value of $177.50, the current price sits below what this widely followed view considers reasonable, and that gap comes from some very specific assumptions about growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The consulting industry's trend toward consolidation and the challenging macro climate are expected to drive \"shakeouts\" among weaker competitors, strengthening FTI's competitive position, client retention, and potential for market share gains, all of which could result in sustainable margin expansion and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Want to see what sits behind that confidence in margins and earnings? The narrative leans on steady revenue progress, firmer profitability, and a future earnings multiple that is lower than many peers. The key point is how those moving parts line up over several years. If you want to understand the full playbook behind the $177.50 fair value, the complete narrative spells out every assumption.</p> <p>In this narrative, discounting future earnings back at just over 7% and pairing mid single digit revenue growth with higher profit margins creates a path that supports the current fair value estimate. Analysts also assume fewer shares on issue and a future P/E that is below where the broader professional services space sits today, which together help close the gap between today’s price and that $177.50 figure.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $177.50 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, there are clear watchpoints, including pressure on higher billing rates if competition intensifies and the risk that automation could chip away at some consulting demand.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FTI Consulting narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Tell A Different Story</h2> <p>While the narrative fair value of $177.50 suggests FTI Consulting is 5.3% undervalued, our DCF model points in the opposite direction, with the shares trading well above an estimated future cash flow value of $0.16. That is a very large gap.

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025, alongside EPS shifting from C$0.49 to C$0.95 over the same period. This sets up an earnings picture where recent quarterly profitability contrasts with a loss making trailing 12 month base.

Critics argue this keeps cash flow and long term earnings visibility under pressure even as individual quarters like Q4 look strong.\n    <ul> <li>Bears also point to weak coverage of interest costs and dividends, with earnings currently not covering a 3.32% dividend yield or interest expense. This ties directly into concerns about elevated debt and C$9b already spent plus C$6b still expected on Baltic Power and Hai Long.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus commentary about step changes in EBITDA from new offshore wind and storage projects is hard to reconcile with the recent pattern of trailing losses, including a trailing loss of C$285.9 million just one quarter earlier in Q3 2025.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Northland’s recent loss pattern and debt funded build out give cautious investors plenty to question in the more optimistic forecasts of future earnings power. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Northland Power Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Slow 1.7% revenue growth versus wider market</h2> <ul> <li>Over the past 12 months, revenue has grown by about 1.7% per year compared to a 6.1% per year forecast for the Canadian market, even though quarterly revenue moved from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025.</li> <li>Analysts' bullish case leans heavily on new projects like Hai Long and Baltic Power and on grid scale storage, arguing that these additions can lift margins from about 2.3% loss making levels today toward 16.5% over three years. However, the current modest 1.7% revenue growth rate and history of wind resource issues and curtailments in places like the German offshore assets show how sensitive actual revenue can be to weather and power price conditions.\n    <ul> <li>On the supportive side for bulls, Q4 2025 revenue of C$725.3 million and net income of C$249.5 million follow Q4 2024 revenue of C$582.3 million and net income of C$126.8 million, which aligns with the view that new assets and better contract mix can improve earnings in stronger periods.</li> <li>Against that, the same 12 month data set still shows the business unprofitable and dropping several onshore and battery projects in Ontario, Alberta, and New York.

Trailing 12 month figures show revenue of about US$2.2 billion and a basic EPS loss of US$4.27, keeping the story firmly in loss-making territory. Over recent periods the company has seen revenue move from US$475.2 million in Q4 2024 to US$596.4 million in Q4 2025. This has come alongside quarterly EPS that has swung between a profit of US$0.20 in Q1 2025 and a loss of US$7.29 in Q2 2025, so investors are watching how quickly that volatility settles into more stable margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\"

roughly US$1.0b, so this is a business with strong top line scale that is still firmly in loss making territory.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that analysts are pairing this 30.7% revenue growth over the last year with forecast earnings growth of about 116.54% per year,\n    <ul> <li>Revenue moving from US$1.7b to about US$2.2b over the last 12 months aligns with the bullish view that digital banking adoption and higher value products like MyPay and Chime Card can support future growth.</li> <li>At the same time, the current trailing 12 month loss of roughly US$1.0b is a reminder that the optimistic margin assumptions in the bullish case depend on a significant shift from today’s loss making base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some bulls argue this mix of US$2.2b in revenue and heavy current losses could be the setup for a sharp earnings swing if their margin expectations play out, but they are starting from a very loss heavy year.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/tgtbueur-update-for-chime-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Chime Financial Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Quarterly Profit Swings Highlight Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, net income ranged from a profit of US$12.9 million in Q1 to a loss of US$923.4 million in Q2, with Q3 and Q4 losses of US$54.7 million and US$44.8 million, so profitability has moved around a lot within a single year.</li> <li>Bears focus on this pattern when they question how smooth the road to profitability might be,\n    <ul> <li>The very large loss in Q2 2025, alongside much smaller losses in Q3 and Q4, supports the cautious narrative that scaling products like MyPay and instant loans could expose Chime to earnings volatility if credit costs or operating expenses spike again.</li> <li>Even with revenue between US$518.7 million and US$596.4 million across the 2025 quarters, the shift from a small profit in Q1 to sizable losses later in the year gives skeptics concrete data to reference when they argue that earnings quality is still unproven.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors often point to the jump from a US$12.9 million profit to a US$923.4 million loss within the same year as a key reason to treat any profitability timelines with caution.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Relies On Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Chime is trading on a P/S ratio of 4.2x compared with peers at 2.0x and the US Diversified Financial industry at 2.4x, so the market is currently valuing each dollar of Chime’s sales at a clear premium to its reference group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative ties that higher multiple to expectations for faster growth,\n    <ul> <li>Forecast revenue growth of 16.7% per year compared with 10.4% for the broader US market is one reason investors may be comfortable paying more than peers for each dollar of current revenue.</li> <li>At the same time, the company is still loss making on a trailing 12 month basis, so the premium P/S ratio is being supported by growth forecasts rather than current profitability, which leaves less room if those forecasts

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of ¥46.2b, so the valuation leans heavily on expected improvements in future cash generation rather than recent cash flow alone.</p> <p>Analysts have provided free cash flow estimates out to 2030, with projections such as ¥278.8b for 2026 and ¥359.7b for 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates additional years of cash flows to complete the 10 year projection, all still in ¥ and then discounted back to today.</p> <p>Putting all of those cash flows together, the DCF model suggests an estimated intrinsic value of about ¥5,305 per share, compared with the recent share price of ¥3,051. That gap implies the stock screens as around 42.5% undervalued on this measure alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Daiichi Sankyo Company is undervalued by 42.5%.

This makes it a practical way to compare companies of different sizes within the same sector.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on expectations and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or perceived stability can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious P/E range.</p> <p>Daiichi Sankyo Company currently trades on a P/E of 18.5x. That is above the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 16.0x, but below the peer group average of 31.3x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the stock of 32.3x, which is the P/E it might reasonably trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming it should trade in line with broad averages. With the current P/E of 18.5x sitting well below the Fair Ratio of 32.3x, the shares currently appear undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4568/daiichi-sankyo-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4568 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3da34022-ad84-492d-b476-e9d83a1ae4e6/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4568 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Your Narrative will automatically refresh when new earnings, news or analyst updates are added, so your view remains current.</p> <p>For example, one Daiichi Sankyo Company Narrative could lean closer to the higher analyst fair value around ¥6,300, built on stronger growth and margins. Another could sit nearer the lower fair value around ¥3,623, built on more cautious assumptions about growth, profitability and future P/E. Both perspectives can coexist side by side on the platform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Daiichi Sankyo Company? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/4568\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4568/daiichi-sankyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4568 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3da34022-ad84-492d-b476-e9d83a1ae4e6/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4568 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over recent quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$162.7 million in Q3 2024 to US$195.2 million in Q4 2024, then to US$182.8 million, US$202.2 million and US$233.9 million through Q1 to Q4 2025. Basic EPS shifted from US$0.20 in Q3 2024 to US$0.38 in Q4 2024, then US$0.26, US$0.43, a loss of US$4.01 and back to US$0.54 in Q4 2025. With trailing results still showing an annual loss and earlier quarters marked by compressed profitability, the latest print puts the focus firmly on whether margins can stabilise from here.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-sfnc/simmons-first-national\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Simmons First National.</a> <p>With the headline numbers set, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the current bull and bear narratives investors are using to frame Simmons First National.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/vjzcq8w3-urbanization-and-digital-adoption-will-transform-us-banking-x4si\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Simmons First National</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-sfnc/simmons-first-national/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:SFNC Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/66a99783-4928-4089-b45d-67659b360ea5/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:SFNC Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Loan book steady while problem credits climb</h2> <ul> <li>Total loans stayed around US$17.1b through FY 2025, while non performing loans moved from US$101.7 million in Q3 2024 to US$153.9 million by Q3 2025.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about healthy commercial and industrial pipelines and higher yielding loans, yet the rise in non performing loans:\n    <ul> <li>Sits alongside commentary about commercial real estate exposure and classification upticks.

This sets up a wide range of views on what the business may be worth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative thinking tries to balance this by pointing out that while analysts expect earnings to reach about NOK957.7m by 2028 with margins easing to 7.6%, they are still using a 14.1x P/E on those earnings to justify targets closer to NOK306.00, which sits well above the DCF fair value but below very aggressive bullish assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>The fact that trailing earnings sit at NOK1.4b, above that NOK957.7m 2028 estimate, helps explain why a cash flow model might point to NOK87.02, while a multiple based on today’s 7.8x P/E and analysts’ future 14.1x assumption can support higher targets.</li> <li>For you as an investor, the tension between a DCF number far below the market price, a market P/E well below peers and an analyst target at NOK306.00 highlights how sensitive valuation is to which metric you trust most.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jq8q31gd-floating-wind-and-renewables-will-drive-demand-despite-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bonheur on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious views leaves you unsure, quickly review the numbers yourself and weigh both sides using <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/capital-goods/ob-bonhr/bonheur-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Bonheur's low 7.8x P/E alongside forecasts for annual earnings declines of about 10.8% and lower future margins suggests the current profit story may be fragile.</p> <p>If that mix of weaker earnings expectations and a wide gap between DCF fair value and the share price worries you, check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">231 high quality undervalued stocks</a> that pair stronger fundamentals with prices that look more grounded in their cash flow profiles.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 67.37% decline signals fading momentum despite recent AI and cybersecurity announcements.</p> <p>If you are reassessing your tech exposure after Kyndryl's recent volatility, it could be a good time to look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential AI infrastructure opportunities beyond a single stock.</p> <p>With KD now trading at $12.31 and data implying a sizeable intrinsic and target price discount, the key question is whether current legal and control risks are already reflected in the price or whether the market still expects weaker growth ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 35.2% Undervalued</h2> <p>At $12.31, the most followed narrative implies Kyndryl Holdings could trade closer to a fair value of $19, using a detailed cash flow and earnings framework.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The company's focus on expanding AI, data, and cybersecurity services, supported by investments in proprietary initiatives like Kyndryl Bridge and new alliances such as Databricks, is allowing Kyndryl to address rising complexity and security requirements, supporting both higher margins and new revenue streams.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/p9m3ecoh-digital-transformation-and-hybrid-cloud-will-create-a-resilient-future-0mb6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what kind of revenue mix and profit profile could back that $19 fair value tag?

Together, these figures point to earnings that are more sensitive to costs and interest expense than the long term 6.5% annual earnings trend might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month net income of $22.4 million is well below the $42.2 million level reported a quarter earlier on a trailing basis, which lines up with the weaker margin picture.</li> <li>Bears highlighting interest coverage as a major risk get some support here because weaker cash generation makes it harder to comfortably meet those interest payments.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 📉 Skeptics who focus on that $27.2 million FFO loss may want the full cautionary case before deciding what comes next: <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 BTB Real Estate Investment Trust Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Margins fall from 29.8% to 17.2%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, BTB’s net profit margin sits at 17.2%, down from 29.8% the prior year, even though trailing revenue held around $130.1 million to $131.8 million.</li> <li>Supportive investors who take a more bullish angle might argue that the 6.5% per year earnings growth over five years shows the business has produced profits over time. However, the latest year of weaker margins and negative earnings relative to that trend pushes them to focus on whether this is a temporary squeeze or a more persistent shift.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 12 month net income of $22.4 million compares with $38.7 million a year earlier on a trailing basis, which is a clear step down even though revenue is broadly similar.</li> <li>With interest payments flagged as not well covered by earnings, the margin compression directly feeds into that risk, since there is less profit left after operating costs to service debt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 16.3x with a DCF fair value of $5.68</h2> <ul> <li>The units trade at a P/E of 16.3x versus a peer average of 11.4x and a Global REITs average of about 16x, while the DCF fair value used here is $5.68 per unit compared to a current price of $4.12. This implies roughly a 27.5% discount to that DCF fair value estimate.</li> <li>What is interesting for a valuation focused bullish angle is that, despite softer margins and weaker interest coverage, the P/E sits above peers yet the unit still screens at a discount to DCF fair value. This sets up a clear tension between earnings based multiples and cash flow based valuation.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 12 month revenue growth rate of 2.6% per year, below the 6.1% Canadian market benchmark, helps explain why some investors might hesitate to pay more even with that DCF gap.</li> <li>At the same time, a 17.2% net margin and positive trailing net income of $22.4 million give bulls some hard numbers to point to when they argue the current $4.12 price already reflects a good part of the recent pressure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how other investors are weighing that 27.5% DCF gap against the earnings pressure, it is worth checking what the community is debating around BTB right now: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/BTB.UN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about BTB Real Estate Investment Trust.</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

At the same time, the consensus narrative also flags future Medicaid payment reductions, so current profitability and the longer term policy overhang are pulling in different directions.</li> </ul> <h2>Low 8.6x P/E against healthcare peers</h2> <ul> <li>UHS trades on a trailing P/E of 8.6x compared with 23.6x for the wider US healthcare industry and 27x for peers, even though trailing earnings have grown 30.4% year over year and have risen about 7.3% per year over the last five years according to the supplied data.</li> <li>Bulls point to this apparent valuation gap and recent earnings strength as support for their case that the company could justify higher pricing. Yet the current share price of US$204.33 still sits well below the cited DCF fair value of about US$588.00 and below the allowed analyst target of US$253.00, which means the bullish argument about underappreciated growth is being made against forecasts that show earnings and revenue growth of 3.1% and 4.2% per year respectively, both slower than the US market in the inputs.\n    <ul> <li>That tension between a low P/E and slower forecast growth is central to the bullish narrative that outpatient and behavioral expansion, plus technology efficiencies, could support higher margins than the consensus currently embeds.</li> <li>At the same time, the supplied data notes the stock trading materially below the DCF fair value and below US$253.00, which bullish investors treat as evidence that the market is not fully crediting the 30.4% trailing earnings growth and 8.6% margin achieved so far.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that the market is underestimating how sustained earnings growth and margin resilience could shift sentiment if current trends hold, especially with the stock on an 8.6x P/E and trading below both DCF fair value and the US$253.00 analyst target. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6pqkl3yw-new-outpatient-facilities-and-telehealth-will-unlock-secular-market-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Universal Health Services Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>High debt and policy risks against slower 3.1% EPS growth</h2> <ul> <li>The inputs highlight a high level of debt on the balance sheet alongside forecast earnings growth of about 3.1% per year and revenue growth of 4.2% per year, both cited as slower than the broader US market even though trailing net income over the last year is US$1.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on that leverage and on regulatory items such as expected US$360m to US$400m annual cuts to Medicaid supplemental payments by 2032, arguing that slower forecast growth plus higher interest and capital needs make it harder to sustain the 8.6% margin, even though recent results show improved profitability and 30.4% trailing earnings growth that so far have run ahead of those cautious assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>Critics highlight that if net benefit from Medicaid programs falls while revenue growth tracks closer to the 4.2% forecast, the combination of debt servicing and lower reimbursement could pressure earnings even if current EPS of US$23.42 on a trailing basis remains solid today.</li> <li>What challenges the bearish stance somewhat is that, despite these risks being flagged, analysts in the supplied data still reference earnings that have grown 7.3% per year over five years and a current margin above last year, which suggests the operational picture has been resilient so far even as future policy changes are being debated.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that high leverage and policy changes could matter more than recent EPS strength, especially if future growth sits near 3.1% while debt stays elevated. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Universal Health Services Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Universal Health Services on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the bullish and bearish angles laid out, how do they stack up for you right now, and what feels most important for your own portfolio decisions?

Together, these factors help explain why the share price has been so reactive, as investors reassess expectations and risk.</li> <li>Against that backdrop, Novo Nordisk currently scores 5 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/dk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/cph-novo-b/novo-nordisk-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation score</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is DKK 52,097.16m. Analyst and extrapolated projections suggest free cash flow reaching DKK 145,840.33m in 2030, with a path that includes DKK 41,926.80m in 2026 and DKK 207,436.58m in 2035. Simply Wall St uses analyst estimates where available, then extends them using its own growth assumptions for the later years.</p> <p>Discounting these projected cash flows back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of DKK 1,072.30 per share. Compared with the recent share price of DKK 238.60, the DCF output suggests the market price is at a 77.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates that the stock appears materially undervalued on this model alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Novo Nordisk is undervalued by 77.7%.

It reflects what the market is willing to pay today for the company’s current profit stream.</p> <p>In simple terms, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative P/E. Novo Nordisk currently trades on a P/E of 10.35x, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 22.54x and a peer average of 26.08x. That raw comparison alone might suggest the stock is priced more cautiously than many of its peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Novo Nordisk is 25.04x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, profit margins, risk characteristics, industry, and market cap. Because it builds in these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison. With the current P/E of 10.35x sitting well below the Fair Ratio of 25.04x, the multiple based view points to the shares looking undervalued on earnings.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/dk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/cph-novo-b/novo-nordisk-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:NOVO B P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71be77aa-1311-4447-b4b8-bcb7f8815b88/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:NOVO B P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Houlihan Lokey’s current share price reflects its true worth, you are not alone. This article is designed to help you size up what you are really paying for.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$169.10, with returns of 1.8% over the past week, a 5.9% decline over the past month, a 4.1% decline year to date, a 0.5% gain over the past year, 86.6% over three years and 182.7% over five years, which may leave you questioning whether the recent path justifies today’s price tag.</li> <li>Recent company updates and sector news have kept Houlihan Lokey on investor watchlists, as corporate activity and advisory demand often steer sentiment around investment banks and financial advisors.

It starts from the equity on the balance sheet, then compares the company’s expected return on that equity to its estimated cost of equity.</p> <p>For Houlihan Lokey, the model uses a Book Value of US$32.92 per share and a Stable EPS of US$9.25 per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 4 analysts. The Average Return on Equity used is 25.05%, while the Cost of Equity is US$2.91 per share, implying an Excess Return of US$6.34 per share. The model also factors in a Stable Book Value of US$36.95 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$178.83 per share. Compared with the recent share price of about US$169.10, this suggests the stock is around 5.4% undervalued. This sits within a reasonable margin of error rather than providing a clear bargain signal.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Houlihan Lokey is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Excess Returns</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare what the market is currently willing to pay for the company’s earnings relative to other options.</p> <p>What counts as a reasonable P/E usually reflects two things: how quickly earnings are expected to grow, and how risky those earnings are perceived to be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk typically support a lower multiple.</p> <p>Houlihan Lokey currently trades on a P/E of 26.35x. That sits above both the Capital Markets industry average of 23.01x and the peer group average of 15.39x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Houlihan Lokey is 16.22x, which is its proprietary view of what a balanced P/E could look like after factoring in earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming one size fits all. With the current 26.35x P/E sitting above the 16.22x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St, within the Community page used by millions of investors, Narratives give you an easy way to set out that story in numbers, see how your view differs from others, and quickly spot when your Fair Value is above or below the current price. This can help you decide whether the stock fits your watchlist or portfolio. Narratives also refresh as new information such as news, earnings or updated analyst estimates are added, so your view does not stay frozen. For Houlihan Lokey, for example, one investor might align with the higher fair value view around US$242.55 per share while another might lean closer to the lower fair value of US$173 per share, and Narratives make those different perspectives clear and comparable in one place.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Houlihan Lokey? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HLI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
