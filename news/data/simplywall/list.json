The latest results, with higher sales but lower net income, do not materially change that core thesis. Near term, the key catalyst is how Calpine integration and new contracts feed into the upcoming 2026 guidance, while execution and regulatory costs on the nuclear side remain a central risk.</p> <p>The Calpine acquisition and the new 380 MW CyrusOne agreement in Texas look most relevant here, because they show how Constellation is using its broadened generation base to anchor multi-year data center deals above 1,100 MW in that state alone. Those contracts sit squarely in the middle of the current catalyst stack, but they also concentrate exposure to a handful of hyperscale buyers and grid bottlenecks in fast-growing regions.</p> <p>Yet even with this growth story, investors should be aware of how rising nuclear compliance and decommissioning costs could eventually pressure...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nasdaq-ceg/constellation-energy/a8rpzb32-ai-power-demand-and-nuclear-momentum-will-unlock-new-opportunities-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Constellation Energy (it's free!)</a></p><p>Constellation Energy's narrative projects $26.7 billion revenue and $3.6 billion earnings by 2028.

Short term, the key catalysts remain earnings delivery against the updated FY2025/26 guidance, the recently increased dividends, and how the market continues to price a low P/E against modest growth forecasts. The Ishikariwan Shinko Unit 2 acceleration fits into this by modestly reinforcing the investment story around supply stability, but it also underscores the ongoing need for heavy capex in a business where debt is not well covered by operating cash flow and dividend cover looks tight. Given the already strong share price gains, this project tweak looks more incremental than transformational to the near term risk‑reward.</p> However, investors should be aware of how rising capex could strain cash generation and dividends.\n\nHokkaido Electric Power Company's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 35%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c387b43e-a10f-4156-b065-ce343cad1687/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value estimate from the Simply Wall St Community centers tightly around ¥909.82 per share, contrasting with recent market pricing.

The DCF fair value cited is NZ$204.61, which is far above the current price.</li> <li>Supporters argue this combination of lower P/E and a DCF fair value so far above NZ$8.48 heavily supports a bullish case, while critics question whether the same 5 year 18% annual earnings decline and high debt level explain why the market is cautious.\n    <ul> <li>On the supportive side, investors see the 12.5x P/E and the very large gap to the NZ$204.61 DCF fair value as signs that the market price is not fully reflecting the trailing year’s NZ$22.1 million profit and 2.1% margin.</li> <li>On the cautious side, the history of multi year earnings decline and the mention of an unstable dividend record show that the cheaper multiples and big modelled gap may be capturing real business risks as well as potential upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The stock trades at $18.81 and is down 15.0% year to date and 40.7% over the past year, reflecting a tough stretch despite the progress in newer product categories.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the key questions for you are how effectively HP manages elevated memory costs and whether AI PC demand remains strong enough to support margins.

On one hand, HP outperformed expectations on both revenue and EPS, with net revenue of US$14.4b compared to US$13.5b a year earlier and non GAAP EPS above consensus. On the other, operating income fell and management is guiding toward the lower end of its full year earnings ranges as DRAM and NAND costs pressure margins. That combination often leads to short term share price weakness, which you are already seeing. However, it also gives you clearer information on how management plans to handle higher input costs through product re configuration, supplier diversification and selective price increases. The fact that HP maintained its fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS range of US$2.47 to US$2.77 while outlining a US$1b cost savings plan suggests management is trying to balance investment in AI PCs with disciplined capital returns, including US$0.6b returned in Q1 and continued buybacks. Against a backdrop of insider share sales and mixed institutional flows, this quarter is likely to be read as a test of whether HP can convert strong AI PC demand into durable earnings power rather than just a one off beat.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The HP Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The strong Q1, with AI PCs at more than one third of shipments and Personal Systems growth, supports the narrative that AI driven PCs and premium devices can underpin revenue and margin resilience.</li> <li>The sharp rise in memory costs and guidance toward the low end of EPS ranges challenges the view that cost restructuring alone can fully offset input cost pressure and structural headwinds in Print.</li> <li>The specific memory cost inflation and the US$1b mitigation plan through FY2028 add more detail on cost risks and timing that are only partially reflected in the existing narrative about restructuring and supply chain diversification.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/9fda6tiy-ai-demand-and-margin-pressures-will-shape-performance-amid-digital-sector-shifts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for HP</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Rising DRAM and NAND prices are creating a roughly US$0.30 full year EPS headwind, which could keep Personal Systems margins below the long term range if mitigation falls short.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts and risk models highlight four key risk factors, including negative shareholders’ equity and concerns around dividend stability and leverage, which may limit how aggressive HP can be with buybacks and payouts.</li> <li>🎁 AI PCs already account for over 35% of shipments, supporting the view that HP can benefit if the PC refresh cycle and demand for higher spec devices continue to support the Personal Systems segment.</li> <li>🎁 Management is pursuing US$1b in gross run rate savings by FY2028 and has continued to return capital through buybacks and dividends, which some investors may see as supportive of per share metrics if executed carefully.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, how quickly memory cost inflation stabilises or is offset through supplier agreements, product design changes and pricing. Second, whether AI PC growth remains strong enough to support revenue and operating margins, especially compared with peers like Dell, Lenovo and Apple in higher end PCs. Third, how capital allocation evolves, including the pace of buybacks after repurchasing 13.3m shares in the latest quarter and any shift in dividend policy, given the balance sheet risk indicators.

This suggests recent news is being viewed as a significant shift in growth prospects and risk profile rather than a short term move.</p> <p>If this AI server and cooling story has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to look across the wider theme through our screen of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential contenders in the same structural trend.</p> <p>With the shares up sharply and trading slightly above the latest analyst price target, yet showing a large intrinsic discount on some models, the key question is whether 2CRSI is still mispriced or if the market is already pricing in years of growth.</p> <h2>Price to sales premium versus fair value and peers</h2> <p>On the numbers provided, 2CRSI looks inexpensive against the SWS DCF estimate yet expensive on its preferred multiple, which is the P/S ratio. The share last closed at €27.70, while the SWS DCF model estimates a future cash flow value of €53.34, and the shares are described as trading 48.1% below that fair value.</p> <p>The SWS DCF model works by projecting future cash flows for the business and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. That approach tries to capture the specific earnings profile of 2CRSI, including factors such as forecast revenue and profit growth, rather than just comparing it to other tech names using a simple market multiple.</p> <p>Set against that, the preferred multiple being used here is the P/S ratio, which currently sits at 2.8x for 2CRSI. This is described as expensive compared to an estimated fair P/S ratio of 0.6x, and also expensive against the European tech industry average P/S of 0.7x, even though it is below a selected peer group average P/S of 4.3x. That mix of signals shows the market is already paying more per euro of sales than broad sector and regression based benchmarks, while still assigning a lower tag than some direct peers.</p> <p>Put simply, the P/S of 2.8x stands well above both the 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average. That represents strong relative pricing that investors will want to weigh against the large DCF gap. If the market ever moves closer to the SWS fair P/S level suggested by the regression work, that would imply a very different share price than today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for 2CRSI</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-sales of 2.8x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also need to factor in execution risks around turning €220.857m of revenue into stronger profitability, as well as the recent rapid share price swings.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this 2CRSI narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on what the price implies</h2> <p>While the P/S of 2.8x looks rich against a 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average, the SWS DCF model points the other way, with a fair value of €53.34 versus the current €27.70, described as 48.1% below fair value.

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extends those projections further out. In this case, free cash flow is projected at ¥82,950.00m by the year ending March 2030, with ten year forecasts combining analyst inputs for the nearer years and extrapolated estimates thereafter. All figures are expressed in ¥ and discounted using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about ¥6,259 per share. Compared with the recent share price of ¥12,650, the model implies the stock is around 102.1% above this estimate, which points to a valuation that is rich relative to these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sumitomo Metal Mining may be overvalued by 102.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 20 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Sumitomo Metal Mining.</a></p> <h2>Approach 2: Sumitomo Metal Mining Price vs Earnings</h2> <p>For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each unit of earnings. A higher P/E usually reflects higher market expectations for future earnings or a lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E often aligns with more modest expectations or higher perceived risk.</p> <p>Sumitomo Metal Mining currently trades on a P/E of 36.0x. That sits above the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 14.5x and also above the peer group average of 34.9x. On simple comparisons, the market is assigning a richer earnings multiple to the stock than to the broader industry and its peer set.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sumitomo Metal Mining is 21.7x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a more “normal” P/E might look like for the company, taking into account factors such as earnings growth profile, profit margins, size, industry and stock specific risks. Because it blends these elements rather than relying only on broad peer or industry averages, the Fair Ratio can provide a more tailored reference point.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 21.7x with the current P/E of 36.0x suggests the shares are trading well above this earnings based reference level.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you see how different assumptions translate into different fair values.</p> <p>Once you have a Narrative, you can compare its Fair Value to the current share price. This can help you decide whether the market price looks attractive, stretched or somewhere in between, based on your own assumptions rather than only a single model output.</p> <p>Narratives also update when new information such as news or earnings is added to the platform, so your story and fair value can stay aligned with the latest data instead of becoming stale.</p> <p>For Sumitomo Metal Mining, one investor might build a Narrative with relatively cautious revenue growth and margins, while another might assume stronger demand and profitability. The Community page allows you to see how those different inputs lead to different fair values.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Sumitomo Metal Mining? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/5713\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5713 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5713 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital is priced fairly today, you are not alone. This article is designed to help you weigh up what you are really paying for.</li> <li>The stock recently closed at US$36.85, with returns of 7.2% over 30 days, 15.8% year to date, 36.9% over 1 year and 41.9% over 3 years, while the 5 year return sits at an 11.4% decline. These figures can change how investors think about both upside potential and risk.</li> <li>Recent news around the broader sustainable infrastructure space has kept attention on companies like HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, as investors assess how funding conditions, policy support and project pipelines might affect long term cash flows. This context helps explain why the share price has moved over different time frames, even without company specific headlines dominating the news cycle.</li> <li>Right now the company scores 2 out of 6 on our valuation checks, giving it a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>.

That implies an average Return on Equity of 15.62% on a Stable Book Value of US$23.44 per share, which comes from estimates by 5 analysts.</p> <p>The required return for shareholders, or Cost of Equity, is set at US$2.19 per share. The difference between what the company is expected to earn and this required return is the Excess Return, estimated at US$1.47 per share. The model then projects these excess returns forward and discounts them back to arrive at an intrinsic value of about US$48.13 per share.</p> <p>Against the recent share price of US$36.85, this implies the stock is around 23.4% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital is undervalued by 23.4%.

It gives you a quick sense of how many years of current earnings the market is effectively pricing in.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends a lot on growth expectations and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or more predictable cash flows can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Right now, HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital trades on a P/E of 23.97x. That sits above the Diversified Financial industry average of about 16.57x and above the peer average of 10.99x, so on simple comparisons the shares look more expensive than many alternatives.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is designed to refine that picture. Its Fair P/E of 15.36x for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital reflects factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks, rather than just broad peer or industry groupings. Because it ties the multiple directly to these fundamentals, it can provide a more tailored benchmark than raw averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 23.97x with the Fair Ratio of 15.36x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, a Narrative is your own explanation behind the numbers, where you set assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform converts that into a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help you assess whether the stock looks worth buying, holding or selling. Narratives are not static, they update when fresh information such as news or earnings is added, so your fair value view can move with the company’s story. For example, one HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Narrative might assume stronger project growth and assign a higher fair value, while another might assume more conservative funding conditions and arrive at a lower fair value.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HASI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The cited forecasts of roughly 10.2% earnings growth and 12.4% revenue growth also indicate that expectations are not zero, so the valuation still assumes the business can at least hold close to its current profitability.</li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

At Comfort Systems USA, the CFO and two directors monetised shares shortly after the company reported very strong fourth quarter and full year 2025 numbers, highlighted an expanded US$11.94b backlog, and saw its stock move to very high levels. The CFO’s sale was sizeable in dollar terms, which tends to draw extra attention, especially when the stock has posted very large multi year returns and is trading near its highs. At the same time, Comfort Systems has just lifted its quarterly dividend from US$0.60 to US$0.70, which points to management confidence in the company’s cash generation. For you, the tension is between insiders taking some money off the table and a business that has just reported strong earnings, raised its dividend, and is deeply involved in data center and technology related projects that many investors view as long term themes.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Comfort Systems USA Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The record earnings, large backlog and stronger dividend fit with the narrative of Comfort Systems USA benefiting from reshoring capex, modular construction and technology driven projects.</li> <li>Heavy insider selling, particularly by the CFO, touches on one of the risks in the narrative that concentrates a lot of growth in large, complex technology and data center projects, which could face sector specific slowdowns.</li> <li>The increased focus on AI infrastructure and data centers, and the recent index inclusion, go further than the earlier narrative, which focused mainly on modular construction, reshoring and service revenue.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l6px86ww-industrial-reshoring-and-modular-demand-will-drive-results-into-2026\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Comfort Systems USA</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Concentration in technology and data center projects could become a problem if those end markets slow, given the size of the current backlog tied to these areas.</li> <li>⚠️ Recent significant insider selling, including by the CFO, breaks a pattern of limited insider selling over prior quarters and may signal that management sees the current share price as an attractive level to trim exposure.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings and revenue for 2025 were much higher than a year earlier, and the backlog of US$11.94b provides multi year visibility across mechanical, electrical and modular projects.</li> <li>🎁 The higher quarterly dividend of US$0.70 per share suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still funding growth in modular and service operations.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on the pattern of insider activity, not just one off sales. Repeated large disposals across several executives could carry a different signal to occasional profit taking. It is also worth tracking how much of the US$11.94b backlog is tied to technology and data center work versus more diversified commercial and industrial projects, as that mix affects both risk and margin potential. Finally, watch how Comfort Systems USA converts that backlog into revenue and cash flow while supporting higher dividends and any future capital returns, especially as it competes with other large contractors such as EMCOR Group and Quanta Services for complex projects.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Comfort Systems USA, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/FIX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Comfort Systems USA</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For Faraday Copper, this high P/B multiple is sitting against a backdrop of no reported revenue, a net loss of CA$25.97m and forecasts that the company will remain unprofitable over the next three years.</p> <p>Against its direct peers, Faraday Copper screens as good value on this metric, with its 20.9x P/B sitting below the peer average of 44.6x. However, when you widen the lens to the broader Canadian metals and mining industry, which sits at 3.8x, the same 20.9x looks expensive, suggesting the market is applying a much richer multiple than the wider group.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price to book of 20.9x (ABOUT RIGHT versus peers, OVERVALUED versus the wider industry)</strong></p> <p>However, you are still backing an exploration stage company with no revenue and a CA$25.97m net loss, so funding conditions or project setbacks could quickly challenge this pricing.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Faraday Copper narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If this all feels finely balanced, it makes sense to look at the numbers yourself and move quickly to shape your own view.

This guidance sits uncomfortably beside earlier hopes that new offerings in areas like holistic wellness and commercial partnerships could support a revenue base closer to flat, and it puts more weight on whether those initiatives can eventually slow subscription losses and revive member engagement.</p> <p>Yet behind the improving free cash flow, investors should be aware of the risk that ongoing hardware and subscription declines could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-pton/peloton-interactive/34aujxkl-pton-major-product-overhaul-and-ai-integration-will-drive-user-experience-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Peloton Interactive (it's free!)</a></p><p>Peloton Interactive's narrative projects $2.5 billion revenue and $113.2 million earnings by 2028.

As a result, recent profit strength sits alongside a much weaker longer term record.\n    <ul> <li>This recent period shows net income at roughly US$1.4b on US$70.4b of sales, while the longer run data points to a multi year earnings decline, so anyone with a bullish angle needs to square that contrast.</li> <li>At the same time, the 2.0% margin is still quite thin in absolute terms, which means even small changes in costs or pricing can move profit up or down quite quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth give bulls some evidence to point to, but the longer multi year earnings decline keeps the story more balanced than a simple recovery narrative suggests. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/F34\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Wilmar International.</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E of 12.3x sits between sector and peers</h2> <ul> <li>Wilmar trades on a P/E of 12.3x, which is cheaper than the Asian Food industry average of 16.1x but higher than a peer group average of 9.9x, so it sits in the middle of the pack on this simple earnings multiple.</li> <li>Critics highlight that even with this mid range P/E, there are clear financial pressure points, especially around interest coverage and dividends, that could justify the market keeping the shares on a discount to some food peers.\n    <ul> <li>The data flags that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which can make a 12.3x multiple feel less comfortable than it looks against the wider industry at 16.1x.</li> <li>The dividend track record is described as unstable and dividend sustainability a concern, so income focused investors may treat the current yield and multiple more cautiously than a simple P/E comparison suggests.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF fair value sits well above the current price</h2> <ul> <li>The current share price of S$3.52 is well below a DCF fair value estimate of about S$6.60, and the dataset also notes that this implies the shares trade roughly 46.7% below that modelled value.</li> <li>Supporters of a more positive stance point to that DCF gap and the 20.6% trailing earnings growth as reasons to consider the stock undervalued, while the same numbers also sit alongside modest forecast growth of about 3.6% a year for earnings and 4.6% a year for revenue, which keeps expectations relatively low.\n    <ul> <li>The projected 3.6% earnings growth is below the Singapore market’s expected 7.5% earnings growth, so the DCF upside does not come with especially strong growth assumptions in these forecasts.</li> <li>Because the net margin is 2.0% on roughly US$70.4b of trailing revenue, even modest growth in sales or small margin shifts can move absolute profit by hundreds of millions of US$, which partly explains why a valuation model can land so far above the current share price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Based on achieving a 30% global market share (up from the previous 25% conservative estimate), the projected Peak Annual Sales for TERN-701 increase to $4.5 Billion. This capture is driven by its anticipated dominance in 2L/3L CML and its eventual entry into the massive 1L market.<br/>• Probability of Success (PoS): The clinical data has significantly de-risked the program. The PoS is increased from 75% to a more confident 80%, reflecting the high likelihood of successful Phase 3 trials and regulatory approval.<br/>• Net Present Value (NPV) Factor: The robust clinical de-risking and the clear blockbuster status ($1B in sales) warrant a higher valuation multiple.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Campbell's current share price still reflects the value of a classic consumer brand, you are not alone. This article is built to help you size that up calmly.</li> <li>At a last close of US$26.86, the stock has seen a 0.4% decline over 7 days, a 1.9% decline over 30 days, and is down 3.1% year to date, with a 29.2% decline over 1 year and a 42.5% decline over 3 years.</li> <li>These moves sit against an ongoing stream of news around packaged food companies, including debates on pricing power, consumer demand for at home meals, and brand relevance in crowded supermarket aisles. For Campbell's, those themes shape how investors think about its earnings resilience and what they are willing to pay for the stock.</li> <li>Simply Wall St currently gives Campbell's a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-cpb/campbells/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4/6</a>, based on how it screens across several checks for being undervalued.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today's terms.</p> <p>For Campbell's, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The last twelve months free cash flow is reported at about $658.3 million. Analysts supply forecasts for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extends those further, with ten year projections reaching $881.2 million in 2035, all in $ terms.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $59.35 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $26.86, this implies a 54.7% discount to that DCF estimate. This suggests that Campbell's may be trading below this particular assessment of its cash flow value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Campbell's is undervalued by 54.7%.

It captures what the market is willing to pay today for those earnings, without needing detailed forecasts.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends a lot on how investors view a company's growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or perceived resilience can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually pulls it down.</p> <p>Campbell's currently trades on a P/E of 13.9x, compared with a Food industry average of 24.5x and a peer group average of 13.2x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" of 20.7x for Campbell's, which is the P/E level it might trade on given its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the factors that make Campbell's different rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. Set against the current P/E of 13.9x, the 20.7x Fair Ratio describes Campbell's shares as screening as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-cpb/campbells/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:CPB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b9a9b32a-2584-4709-a4a3-d825b2a7a6f7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:CPB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

As a result, your Fair Value view moves with the information, and you can quickly see if your story still lines up with how Campbell's is trading.</p> <p>For Campbell's, one investor might build a Narrative closer to the higher Fair Value views around US$55.33 that lean on stronger Snacks, premium products and supply chain efficiency. Another might sit near the more cautious US$26.00 Fair Value that leans on pressure from private labels, tariffs and slower processed food demand. Both investors can see in real time how their Fair Value compares to the current price.</p> <p>For Campbell's, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Campbell's Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-cpb/campbells/d80u9vdb-consumer-preferences-and-operational-efficiency-will-build-future-resilience-kajn?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Campbell's Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this Narrative: US$31.56</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at US$26.86: 14.9%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 0.58%</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this Narrative see steady demand for soups, broths, sauces and snacks supported by at-home cooking, health-focused tweaks to recipes, and premium products.</li> <li>They build in rising profit margins over the next few years, supported by cost-savings programs, supply chain work and focused marketing on brands such as Rao's and Goldfish.</li> <li>The result is a consensus price target of US$34.58 that sits close to where shares are trading in this view, which they frame as broadly in line with their estimate of fair value.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-cpb/campbells/xg4qpi1w-declining-processed-food-sales-and-tariffs-will-weaken-prospects-qnnl?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Campbell's Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this Narrative: US$26.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at US$26.86: 3.3%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 0.45% decline</p> <ul> <li>This Narrative leans into concerns that consumer preferences for fresher and private-label options keep pressuring Campbell's volumes, pricing power and category relevance.</li> <li>It places more weight on tariffs, regulatory costs and the risk that new products in soups and snacks do not fully offset headwinds, which keeps revenue growth assumptions muted.</li> <li>Using those inputs, the fair value comes out at US$26.00, which is below the recent share price and lines up with the lowest end of current analyst targets.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are framing stories like these, and how their numbers stack up against current pricing, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?
