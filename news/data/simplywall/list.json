The upgraded FY26 profit and ARR guidance reinforces that storyline and likely strengthens the near term catalyst around recurring revenue growth. At the same time, it does not remove the key risk that expectations embedded in the current valuation could still prove demanding if growth slows.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the upgraded FY26 guidance is the most directly relevant. Lifting profit before tax growth expectations to 18% to 20% and ARR growth to 16% to 18% gives more concrete shape to the SaaS+ thesis that many investors are watching closely. Combined with continuing board refreshment and Philip Davis’ initial on market share purchase, it supports a narrative of management leaning into the recurring revenue opportunity while the market reassesses shorter term share price weakness.</p> <p>But against this stronger guidance, investors should still weigh the risk that Technology One’s premium valuation could come under pressure if revenue growth in key markets were to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/software/asx-tne/technology-one-shares/nfnd5wy8-overvaluation-will-encounter-regulatory-headwinds-and-saas-resilience-hxrs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Technology One (it's free!)</a></p><p>Technology One’s narrative projects A$841.0 million revenue and A$224.2 million earnings by 2028.

The new FulcrumAir partnership fits neatly into this narrative: it reinforces PLP’s position in automated installation systems, but is unlikely to be a near term financial needle-mover compared with more immediate catalysts like order flow from utilities, margin trends after a softer Q3 2025, and how the business justifies its current premium P/E multiple. Where it might matter more is on the risk side: deeper integration into robotics raises execution and R&amp;D risk, but also gives PLP another way to defend its niche if competition in more traditional products intensifies.</p> But there is one operational and valuation risk in particular that investors should not ignore.\n\nPreformed Line Products' share price has been on the slide but might be dropping deeper into value territory. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out whether it's a bargain at this price</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92e40fc7-c157-465d-983d-ab7b75e39451/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates span roughly US$77 to US$285, showing just how far apart private investors can be on PLP.

The 2025 10-K reinforces that story: management is leaning into a diversified deposit base, higher-yielding securities and a thicker capital cushion, with CET1 at 14.10% and shareholders’ equity up 14.4%. That is reassuring given recent volatility in bank funding costs, and it supports the near-term dividend story after the latest increase to US$0.24 per share. At the same time, the filing also puts a spotlight on the weak revenue growth, a 3.1% net interest margin and a greater tilt toward variable-rate loans, which keeps interest rate risk, funding competition and the stock’s above-peer valuation firmly on the list of near-term swing factors.</p> However, investors should not ignore how interest rate sensitivity could pressure margins if conditions shift.\n\nDespite retreating, First Bancorp's shares might still be trading 41% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/18aaef02-f6ad-4640-bf94-5195b7c7866f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$54 to almost US$97 per share, underlining how far apart individual views can be.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are trying to figure out whether USA Rare Earth is attractively priced or already baking in a lot of optimism, you are in the right place.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$18.90, with returns of 9.7% over the past week, a 14.4% decline over the last 30 days, and gains of 33.6% year to date and 69.8% over the past year. That performance will catch the eye of anyone tracking shifts in risk and reward.</li> <li>Recent attention on USA Rare Earth has focused on its role in rare earth supply chains and investor interest in companies tied to critical materials. This helps frame the context for those returns and has kept the stock on the radar for investors who follow long term themes in materials and technology supply security.</li> <li>On our valuation framework, USA Rare Earth scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today’s terms.</p> <p>For USA Rare Earth, the latest twelve month free cash flow (FCF) is a loss of $39.02 million. Analyst and model projections see FCF running through a mix of negative and positive years, with a projected $735.00 million in FCF for 2030. Beyond the explicit analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends the cash flow path using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.</p> <p>Combining all of those discounted cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $203.77 per share. When this is compared with the recent share price of $18.90, the model suggests the stock trades at a 90.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates substantial potential upside based solely on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests USA Rare Earth is undervalued by 90.7%.

It is especially common in capital intensive sectors where tangible assets matter.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/B, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower multiple. That is why it helps to look at a company’s P/B next to its sector and peers, rather than in isolation.</p> <p>USA Rare Earth currently trades on a P/B ratio of 68.02x. This sits well above the Metals and Mining industry average P/B of 2.66x and above the peer group average of 8.63x. Simply Wall St also uses a “Fair Ratio”, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/B should be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s risks, its industry and its market cap. This Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored anchor than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for those company specific features.</p> <p>On this framework, USA Rare Earth’s current P/B of 68.02x is higher than the Fair Ratio assessment would typically support.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 19 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your USA Rare Earth Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These are simply your story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins and fair value.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit in the Community page and let you connect USA Rare Earth’s business story to a clear financial forecast, then to a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to help you decide whether it feels more like a buy, a hold or a sell for you.</p> <p>Because Narratives on the platform are updated as new information comes in, such as news or earnings, they stay aligned with the latest data without you needing to rebuild your thinking from scratch every time something changes.</p> <p>For example, one Narrative on USA Rare Earth might see a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future cash flows and margins. Another Narrative might point to a much lower fair value because its author expects more modest revenue and profitability.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for USA Rare Earth? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/USAR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The proceeds are earmarked for debt repayment and corporate purposes, directly affecting Whirlpool’s capital structure at a time when its dividend coverage, leverage and profitability are already under scrutiny, and when consensus still expects only modest revenue growth and mid single digit margins.</p> <p>Yet, while recapitalization may support financial flexibility, investors should also be aware of the growing tension between dilution risk and Whirlpool’s ability to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Whirlpool (it's free!)</a></p><p>Whirlpool's narrative projects $15.8 billion revenue and $741.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Whirlpool's forecasts yield a $87.67 fair value</a>, a 28% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/67dc9682-e1be-411e-a8eb-0d0aa3a0425f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>The lowest set of analysts sketches a much more cautious path than consensus, arguing that tightening environmental and recycling rules could push Whirlpool’s already thin margins even lower.

The Driivz and XLR8 America partnership, combined with new innovation leadership and a small regular dividend, supports this digital shift but does not materially change the near term risk that traditional Fueling Solutions could be pressured by faster EV adoption.</p> <p>Among the latest announcements, Driivz’s agreement to manage over 5,000 EV charging sites for XLR8 America looks most relevant, as it directly extends Vontier’s reach into EV charging software and services. This aligns with the key catalyst that recurring SaaS and services can become a larger share of revenue and profit, partly offsetting exposure to slower growth in legacy fuel dispensers and environmental monitoring products.</p> <p>Yet beneath this push into EV charging and AI driven innovation, investors still need to be aware that Vontier remains heavily exposed to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-vnt/vontier/93vwx4j5-digital-payment-and-saas-will-transform-fueling-industry-dm6i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Vontier (it's free!)</a></p><p>Vontier's narrative projects $3.4 billion revenue and $549.8 million earnings by 2028.

The latest inflation-driven selloff, layered on top of earlier expense concerns, mainly sharpens attention on near term funding costs and credit quality. It does not yet appear to alter the key longer term catalyst from policy changes, but it could increase the perceived risk around margins.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, SLM’s recent US$500,000,000 share repurchase authorization stands out. After the stock’s steep pullback, ongoing buybacks and the existing 2.77% dividend signal that management is continuing to return capital even as analysts reassess expense trends and earnings forecasts. How effectively SLM balances capital return with maintaining a buffer against potential inflation related funding and credit shocks is now central to how investors view the near term risk reward trade off.</p> <p>But there is one inflation related funding risk investors really need to keep in mind...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm/781dxfkl-slm-lower-federal-student-loan-supply-will-boost-private-lending-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on SLM (it's free!)</a></p><p>SLM's narrative projects $2.0 billion revenue and $918.9 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm/781dxfkl-slm-lower-federal-student-loan-supply-will-boost-private-lending-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how SLM's forecasts yield a $31.64 fair value</a>, a 69% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SLM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/24c59d2b-d47b-41c8-b3ae-b808386bc7ce/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SLM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>While the baseline view leans on policy driven loan growth, the most pessimistic analysts were already assuming revenue of about US$1.7 billion and earnings of roughly US$554.0 million, reminding you that opinions can differ sharply and that this inflation shock could push those expectations and the underlying risk balance in very different directions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 2 other fair value estimates on SLM</a> - why the stock might be worth just $31.64!</p><h2>Form Your Own Verdict</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your SLM research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 4 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free SLM research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate SLM's overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Ready For A Different Approach?</h2><p>Our top stock finds are flying under the radar-for now.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $50.6 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further to build a 10 year view. Within that, projected free cash flow for 2028 is $1.29 billion, and the discounted values of projected cash flows from 2026 through 2035 range from roughly $728 million to $1.51 billion per year.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $11.34 per share, compared with the recent share price of $4.22. That gap implies the stock is around 62.8% undervalued on this DCF view.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Grab Holdings is undervalued by 62.8%.

You can think of it as a quick check on how the market is weighing the trade off between what the business earns today, the growth investors hope for, and the risks they see.</p> <p>A higher P/E can sometimes reflect stronger growth expectations or lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E can point to the opposite, or simply lower market enthusiasm. For Grab Holdings, the current P/E is 64.57x, compared with the Transportation industry average of 37.54x and a peer group average of 28.08x, so the shares are trading at a higher multiple than both these benchmarks.</p> <p>Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” to estimate what a more suitable P/E could be, given factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it blends these elements, the Fair Ratio can be a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peers or the broader industry. Grab Holdings has a Fair Ratio of 25.27x, which is well below its current P/E of 64.57x, indicating that the shares are pricing in more optimism than this model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-grab/grab-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:GRAB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/42550d29-9c5a-406d-98f7-4e9293ce901e/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:GRAB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The NZ$46.7 million single gain sits next to underlying net income of NZ$173.4 million in H2 2025 and NZ$103.8 million in H1 2025, so anyone leaning bullish needs to separate that one off item from the recurring profit story.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the 76.7% earnings growth and 37.9% margin can point to the NZ$183.4 million trailing profit, but the one off gain means the underlying run rate is lower than the headline suggests.</li> <li>Critics who highlight profit quality risk can point to the prior 23.5% margin and the NZ$46.7 million gain as reasons to treat the trailing margin and profit with some caution when they compare halves over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue creeps higher while EPS steps up</h2> <ul> <li>Across the last three reported halves, revenue has moved from NZ$217.4 million in H2 2024 to NZ$225.0 million in H1 2025 and NZ$239.7 million in H2 2025, while basic EPS over the same halves came in at NZ$0.0648, NZ$0.0890 and NZ$0.1680 respectively, and the trailing 12 month EPS now sits at NZ$0.2719 on NZ$483.8 million of revenue.</li> <li>Supporters of a more optimistic narrative often point to Port of Tauranga as a core infrastructure style asset, and the combination of steadily higher half year revenues and a five year average earnings growth rate of 9.7% per year fits that story, although the recent 76.7% year over year earnings jump and NZ$46.7 million one off gain mean the latest EPS figures sit above the longer term growth profile.\n    <ul> <li>On the one hand, trailing 12 month revenue of NZ$483.8 million and forecast revenue growth of about 5.3% per year line up with the idea of a business tied to ongoing trade flows.</li> <li>On the other hand, when you compare trailing EPS of NZ$0.2719 and a 76.7% earnings lift to the 9.7% per year five year average, it shows the recent step up is much sharper than the longer trend and partly linked to that one off gain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> To see how this recent revenue and EPS path fits into different long term storylines around the company, it is worth looking at how other investors frame the trade off between steady trade linked volumes and one off gains in their narratives about Port of Tauranga, and weighing those views against the numbers above. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NZSE/POT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Port of Tauranga.</strong></a> <h2>P/E of 29.9x versus peers</h2> <ul> <li>The current P/E ratio of 29.9x at a share price of NZ$8.05 sits above the global infrastructure industry average of 15.9x and a peer average of 25.7x, while remaining below an alternative infrastructure benchmark of 31.6x and above a DCF fair value of NZ$5.63 that is lower than the current price.</li> <li>Bears who worry about valuation risk see several concrete markers, as the share price of NZ$8.05 is above the NZ$5.63 DCF fair value and the 29.9x P/E is higher than both the 15.9x global infrastructure average and the 25.7x peer average, even though revenue is only forecast to grow about 5.3% per year and earnings by 3.4% per year.\n    <ul> <li>Those valuation comparisons mean the market is assigning a higher multiple than many of the reference groups despite the modest 3.4% forecast earnings growth versus a 16.3% New Zealand market forecast.</li> <li>At the same\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Slip As Profit Growth Trails Revenue</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, net income sits at US$1.1b on US$7.2b of revenue, which equates to a 15.6% net margin compared with 18.1% a year earlier, while earnings grew 1.1% over the past year versus a 1.8% per year average over five years.</li> <li>Bears focus on this margin pressure, arguing that heavier cloud, AI and transaction model costs could keep profitability under strain, and the current data lines up with several of those concerns:\n    <ul> <li>Management has highlighted that the new transaction model and annual billings can temporarily flatter billings and free cash flow, which bears see as a risk if those boosts fade while the trailing net margin is already at 15.6%.</li> <li>They also point out that cloud and AI workloads are expected to weigh on gross margin and that management itself flags potential operating margin headwinds in fiscal 2027, which is consistent with the recent move from 18.1% to 15.6% net margin.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics argue these FY 2026 margins hint at a tougher profit path ahead than the share price implies, and they are watching closely to see if cost and pricing plans can offset cloud and transaction model headwinds. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/sjp874pi-cloud-workflow-friction-and-ai-monetization-delays-will-eventually-support-stronger-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Autodesk Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue And EPS Step Up, But Growth Pace Looks Measured</h2> <ul> <li>Quarterly revenue progressed from US$1,570m in Q3 FY 2025 to US$1,957m in Q4 FY 2026, and basic EPS moved from US$1.28 to US$1.49 over the same Q3 FY 2025 to Q4 FY 2026 comparison, while trailing twelve month EPS edged from US$5.17 to US$5.28.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about expanding cloud and AI driven workflows supporting strong long term demand, yet the recent numbers paint a more measured earnings pace, which creates a gap investors need to watch:\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to grow about 20.3% per year over the next three years, but the latest one year earnings growth rate of 1.1% is well below that figure, so the current run rate has not yet caught up with those expectations.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue is US$7.2b and is forecast to grow 9.6% per year, which is a solid absolute level but slightly below the 10.3% revenue growth forecast for the broader US market, so Autodesk will need its product mix and pricing to work hard to deliver the higher earnings growth that is being modeled.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Mixed Valuation Signals Around A US$245.89 Share Price</h2> <ul> <li>With the stock at US$245.89, it trades on a 46.3x P/E, below a 50x peer average but above the 26.4x US software industry, while a DCF fair value of about US$312.43 and an analyst price target of roughly US$337.33 both sit above the current price.</li> <li>Bulls argue that Autodesk’s position in cloud based AEC and manufacturing workflows, plus AI features, justify that premium P/E and the upside implied by models and targets, and today’s numbers give them some support but also a few checks:\n    <ul> <li>Support comes from the combination of high recurring software revenue, US$7.2b in trailing sales and forecasts for roughly 12% annual revenue growth with earnings expected to reach about US$2.0b by around 2028, which helps explain why models point to DCF fair value above the current share price.</li> <li>The tension is that current net margin is 15.6%, below the 18.1% level a year earlier, while those same bullish assumptions rely on margins rising into the low 20% range over the next few years, so investors need to decide whether today’s margin profile is a temporary step on that path or a sign that the ramp could be slower.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see the gap between the US$245.89 share price and modelled fair values as an opportunity, but these FY 2026 margins and growth rates are exactly what they point to when debating how quickly Autodesk can earn into that premium.\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth,
