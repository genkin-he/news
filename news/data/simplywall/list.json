Revenue is forecast to grow at 3.1% per year, trailing the broader US market’s predicted 10.2% annual pace, and its shares are currently trading at $15.79, a premium to both industry and peer price-to-earnings ratios, as well as above an estimated fair value of $8.51.

The payout aligns with expectations set by improved operating margins, but it is closely linked to the same profitability and cost efficiency drivers highlighted in the latest earnings, factors still sensitive to capacity and fleet transition risks in the near term.\n</p> <p> On the flip side, investors should keep a close watch on how aircraft delivery delays could disrupt near-term growth and margin plans, as...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/transportation/asx-qan/qantas-airways-shares/fleet-renewal-and-dual-brand-strategy-will-strengthen-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Qantas Airways (it's free!)</a></p><p>Qantas Airways is forecast to generate A$28.1 billion in revenue and A$2.1 billion in earnings by 2028.

Worse, the business reported a statutory loss of ₹1.20 per share, a substantial decline on analyst expectations of a profit.     Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

If met, it would imply a decent 8.2% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Mahindra Logistics is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of ₹7.42 per share.       In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ₹70.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹7.08 in 2026.        So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential following these results.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/transportation/nse-mahlog/mahindra-logistics-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Mahindra Logistics </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 8.1% to ₹389, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Mahindra Logistics analyst has a price target of ₹560 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at ₹279.   This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Mahindra Logistics' past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/industrials/logistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's clear from the latest estimates that Mahindra Logistics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 17% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 14% p.a. over the past five years.    By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year.  It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Mahindra Logistics to grow faster than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.  </p><p> Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Continuous innovation through shorter product lead times, rapid product cycles, and more frequent fashion and cultural collaborations is enabling Victoria's Secret to better respond to consumer preferences and cultural trends, resulting in higher regular-priced sales and mitigating promotional markdowns, supporting gross margin improvement.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/nm7aie17-global-expansion-and-inclusivity-will-create-future-opportunities-lyrp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p> Want to know why the fair value sits so far below the market price?

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a <em>base</em> of capital employed that's also declining.  This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking.

The formula for this calculation on Together Pharma is: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.0052 = ₪375k ÷ (₪152m - ₪80m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Together Pharma has an ROCE of 0.5%.</strong> In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 13%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/media/tase-tgtr/together-pharma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Together Pharma </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/media/tase-tgtr/together-pharma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/54033193-roce-1-dark-2/1761798331571\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:TGTR Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Together Pharma's ROCE against it's prior returns.

If current liabilities hadn't increased as much as they did, the ROCE could actually be even lower.   And with current liabilities at these levels, suppliers or short-term creditors are effectively funding a large part of the business, which can introduce some risks.     </p> <h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> In short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence.      Unsurprisingly then, the stock has dived 88% over the last  five years, so investors are recognizing these changes and don't like the company's prospects.

In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.  </p><p> You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/banks/tase-fibi/first-international-bank-of-israel-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882238-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798378304\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:FIBI Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We know that First International Bank of Israel has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  We note that for First International Bank of Israel the TSR over the last 5 years was 281%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> First International Bank of Israel shareholders are up 47% for the year (even including dividends).  But that was short of the market average.    On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 31% over half a decade  This suggests the company might be improving over time.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr18.76 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.   Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.    </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr151m for 7.95m shares.  On the other hand they divested 5.73k shares, for kr135k.     In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).</a> </p> <h2> Insider Ownership Of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria </h2><p> For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders.  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.   Insiders own 29% of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria shares, worth about kr596m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria Tell Us? </h2><p> It is good to see recent purchasing.    And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence.   However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious.     When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low.  Nice!

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin.  We can see that <strong>Formula Systems (1985) Ltd.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:FORTY</a>) does use debt in its business.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2025 Formula Systems (1985) had debt of US$501.7m, up from US$472.7m in one year.    On the flip side, it has US$406.2m in cash leading to net debt of about US$95.5m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/386267-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798420891\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:FORTY Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Balance Sheet? </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Formula Systems (1985) had liabilities of US$1.19b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$540.9m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$406.2m in cash and US$883.2m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it has liabilities totalling US$444.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, Formula Systems (1985) has a  market capitalization of US$2.24b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Formula Systems (1985) </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). </p> <p> Formula Systems (1985)'s net debt is only 0.30 times its EBITDA.  And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 15.1 times over.  So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt.        Also good is that Formula Systems (1985) grew its EBIT at 12% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt.       The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Formula Systems (1985) will need earnings to service that debt.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Over the most recent three years, Formula Systems (1985) recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax.  This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> The good news is that Formula Systems (1985)'s demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler.   And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening.      Zooming out, Formula Systems (1985) seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us.  After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.    <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Formula Systems (1985) </a>, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.   </p> <p> If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our list of net cash growth stocks</a> without delay. </p></div>",

Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> How Much Debt Does NEPON Carry? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NEPON had debt of JP¥1.76b at the end of June 2025, a reduction from JP¥1.95b over a year.    However, it does have JP¥790.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about JP¥972.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883647-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798465515\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7985 Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At NEPON's Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NEPON had liabilities of JP¥2.46b due within 12 months and liabilities of JP¥995.0m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had JP¥790.0m in cash and JP¥1.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by JP¥1.11b.   </p><p> This is a mountain of leverage  relative to its  market capitalization of JP¥1.40b.  Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for NEPON </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While we wouldn't worry about NEPON's net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.7, we think its super-low interest cover of 1.8 times is a sign of high leverage.   It seems that the business incurs large depreciation and amortisation charges, so maybe its debt load is heavier than it would first appear, since EBITDA is arguably a generous measure of earnings.   So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately.       One redeeming factor for NEPON is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of JP¥44m, over the last twelve months.     When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is NEPON's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow.    Over the last year, NEPON recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect.  That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Neither NEPON's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt.   But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience.       Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think NEPON's debt poses some risks to the business.  So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Another way to think of that is that for every AED1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn AED0.21 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Lachish Industries currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching this positive performance.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

This <strong>free</strong> interactive report on Victory Securities (Holdings)'s <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">earnings, revenue and cash flow</a> is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.  </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR).  The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.   For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Victory Securities (Holdings)</strong> (2 don't sit too well with us) </a> that you should be aware of.   </p><p> There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Afrimat's Profit Performance</h2><p> We'd posit that Afrimat's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item.      Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Afrimat is showing <strong>2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 1 of those is significant...   </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Afrimat's profit.

Margin gains of over 1 percentage point already support this thesis.\n      </li> <li> The shift to outcome-based commercial models aligns management strategy with analysts' forecasts for earnings per share rising from $1.92 to $2.65 over the next three years, reinforcing long-term stability in profit growth.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To see how these operational shifts fit the big-picture consensus, get the full story in the <strong>analysts’ narrative</strong>: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6wevnytq-ai-powered-expansion-and-global-partnerships-will-drive-future-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full ExlService Holdings Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings Discount vs Industry Peers</h2> <ul> <li> ExlService trades at a 25.3x price-to-earnings ratio, below the peer average of 33.4x and the industry average of 27.2x, while delivering higher historical earnings growth, signaling investors may be undervaluing its sustained profitability.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative points out that despite strong compounding earnings and margin trends, the market is not pricing ExlService at a premium, perhaps due to caution over future industry dynamics.\n    <ul> <li> Even with analyst forecasts for revenue growth of 10.9% annually and margin expansion, valuation remains restrained. This underscores a potential disconnect between robust fundamentals and current market expectations.\n      </li> <li> The 18.5% gap between the current share price ($38.54) and the nearest consensus price target ($52.71) reflects this ongoing hesitance, despite ExlService’s track record of outpacing industry averages.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Long-Term Risks: Margin Pressure and Sector Exposure</h2> <ul> <li> Analysts project profit margins will see only modest improvement, reaching 12.2% in three years from 12.0% today, as rising wage inflation in key outsourcing hubs like India and the Philippines continues to elevate costs.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative flags sector concentration and compliance challenges as principal risks, highlighting that heavy reliance on insurance and healthcare clients could amplify earnings volatility.\n    <ul> <li> Exposure to fast-changing regulatory environments in those sectors carries real risk for cross-border profitability, especially as new data privacy rules and reimbursement changes increase compliance costs.\n      </li> <li> Margin gains may be limited by talent shortages. Costs have grown 16 to 17 percent despite only 9 percent headcount increases, which could dilute the benefits of higher-value service offerings if not managed proactively.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6wevnytq-ai-powered-expansion-and-global-partnerships-will-drive-future-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for ExlService Holdings on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Looking at the results from a different angle?

The recent partnership restructuring with OpenAI reinforces Microsoft’s access to next-generation AI models, supporting its leading position in cloud and productivity, but does not materially alter the main short-term catalyst: continued robust Azure and AI-driven cloud revenue growth. The biggest risk remains heavy capital spending requirements, if AI or cloud adoption disappoints, returns could face pressure.\n\nAmong recent announcements, Confluent’s newly expanded integration with Microsoft OneLake and Fabric directly illustrates how Microsoft’s platform is attracting partners that want to deliver seamless real-time analytics and AI capabilities to enterprise customers. This supports Azure’s position as an ecosystem for innovation and highlights the scale of workloads driving Azure’s growth, the exact area investors will be watching most closely as the next earnings report arrives.\n\nYet, under the surface, investors should be mindful of how Microsoft’s massive investments in AI infrastructure could impact future profitability if growth trends shift...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-msft/microsoft/45qphubr-analyst-commentary-highlights-microsoft-ai-momentum-and-upward-valuation-amid-growth-and-competitive-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Microsoft (it's free!)</a></p><p>Microsoft's outlook anticipates $425.0 billion in revenue and $158.4 billion in earnings by 2028.

While headline profit metrics present a strong performance, investors should note that over the past five years, earnings have actually declined by an average of 18.3% per year.

Its Price-To-Earnings Ratio sits at a deep discount compared to both the industry (15.3x) and peer group (22.8x), with its own P/E at just 0.6x.</li> <li> These figures underscore a tension in the prevailing narrative, which overshadows potential bullish arguments about value:\n    <ul> <li>Yield-focused investors may see the low P/E as a bargain, but the gap to DCF fair value challenges the perception that HEIM PREF is genuinely “cheap.”</li> <li>The strong earnings and margins resulted from a one-off SEK11.9 billion gain last year, rather than ongoing operations. This raises questions about future profitability at current price levels.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Lack of Recurring Profit Drivers</h2> <ul> <li>Over the past five years, earnings have declined on average by 18.3% per year, making the latest strong margin (40.4%) an outlier driven by non-recurring items, not by persistent business improvements.</li> <li> The prevailing market view is notable for its contrast between stable dividend expectations among income-seeking investors and the absence of genuine recurring earnings power:\n    <ul> <li>The one-year earnings jump of 791.5% stands in sharp contrast to the longer-term trend of shrinking profits.</li> <li>Without new recurring income streams, any bullish outlook on future distributions faces real headwinds from the weak longer-term track record.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Masks Sector Headwinds</h2> <ul> <li>Heimstaden’s P/E of 0.6x is deeply discounted compared to industry and peer group averages. However, this headline “cheapness” reflects sector-wide concerns over financial stability and non-recurring profit quality, not market enthusiasm.</li> <li> Prevailing analysis points to a defensive income appeal but also cautions that macro pressures, especially higher interest rates and real estate devaluation risks, remain at the forefront:\n    <ul> <li>Stable rental cash flows are a positive, yet sector volatility and weak underlying growth challenge any simple value thesis.</li> <li>Any recovery in price or profits is likely dependent on an improvement in sector conditions rather than company-specific momentum at this time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "title": "Investors Still Aren't Entirely Convinced By Utssav CZ Gold Jewels Limited's (NSE:UTSSAV) Earnings Despite 30% Price Jump",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> <strong>Utssav CZ Gold Jewels Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:UTSSAV</a>) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 30% after a shaky period beforehand.    Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 16% is also fairly reasonable.   </p><p> Even after such a large jump in price, given about half the companies in India have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") above 28x, you may still consider Utssav CZ Gold Jewels as an attractive investment with its 22.3x P/E ratio.  Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p> <p> Utssav CZ Gold Jewels certainly has been doing a great job lately as it's been growing earnings at a really rapid pace.   One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings growth might actually underperform the broader market in the near future.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Utssav CZ Gold Jewels </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"pe-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/41692799-pe-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark-2/1761784858077\" width=\"1640\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:UTSSAV Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Utssav CZ Gold Jewels'</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?  </h2><p> In order to justify its P/E ratio, Utssav CZ Gold Jewels would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 52% gain to the company's bottom line.   The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 429% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is only predicted to deliver 25% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is stronger based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> With this information, we find it odd that Utssav CZ Gold Jewels is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  It looks like most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> The latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Utssav CZ Gold Jewels' P/E close to the market median.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Utssav CZ Gold Jewels currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  When we see strong earnings with faster-than-market growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing significant pressure on the P/E ratio.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>4 warning signs for Utssav CZ Gold Jewels</strong> </a> (2 can't be ignored) you should be aware of.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a low P/E. </a> </p></div>",
