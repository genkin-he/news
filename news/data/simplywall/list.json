The latest half-year update, with record output and A$96.3 million in net income, reinforces that story by showing Sand King is not just online, but already repaid and throwing off cash. That materially strengthens the near-term funding case for the proposed ~3 mtpa mill and Waihi open pit restart, and may ease concerns about overreliance on the new debt facility. At the same time, the sharp share price pullback over the past month suggests the market is still focused on execution risk, especially around sustaining margins and converting today’s strong free cash flow into durable returns if gold prices soften.</p> However, one risk around sustaining current margins and cash flows deserves closer attention. \nOra Banda Mining's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/10ee5398-4b96-4b2c-b0ad-b48a665e44bf/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Eleven fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span A$1.11 to about A$4.36 per share, showing wide disagreement on what Ora Banda is worth.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Iron Mountain's current share price still offers value or if most of the upside is already reflected, you are not alone. This article is designed to help you frame that question clearly.</li> <li>The stock closed at US$108.33, with a 1.8% decline over the last 7 days, a 17.4% gain over 30 days, a 30.1% return year to date, a 20.5% return over 1 year, a 120.6% return over 3 years and a 273.5% return over 5 years. This gives important context before weighing up valuation.</li> <li>Recent coverage has focused on Iron Mountain's positioning as a real estate and data focused business, alongside ongoing interest in how traditional storage assets and data center exposure fit together for long term investors. These themes help explain why the share price performance over multiple time frames is drawing attention from investors who care about both income and growth potential.</li> <li>On our checks, Iron Mountain scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, which you can see in more detail in its <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation score</a>.

For Iron Mountain, this version of the DCF uses adjusted funds from operations as a proxy for free cash flow to equity.</p> <p>The model starts from Iron Mountain’s last twelve months free cash flow of about $1.54b, then uses analyst estimates for the next few years and extends them out to 2035. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $2.49b, with intermediate annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are either based on analyst forecasts or extrapolated estimates by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows results in an estimated intrinsic value of about $155.76 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$108.33, the model implies the stock trades at a 30.4% discount. On this DCF view, Iron Mountain screens as undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iron Mountain is undervalued by 30.4%.

It is especially handy when earnings can be affected by non cash items or accounting choices, while sales remain a cleaner top line measure.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/S ratio depends on how quickly investors expect sales to grow and how much risk they see in those expectations. Higher perceived growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tends to line up with a lower ratio.</p> <p>Iron Mountain currently trades on a P/S ratio of 4.64x. That sits below the Specialized REITs industry average of 7.56x and below the peer group average of 7.32x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for Iron Mountain is 5.32x, which estimates the P/S level that fits its earnings profile, industry, profit margin, size and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or industry averages because it folds in those company specific factors. With the current 4.64x P/S sitting below the 5.32x Fair Ratio, Iron Mountain appears undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 19 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Iron Mountain Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company linked directly to the numbers behind its fair value, such as what you think Iron Mountain can earn, how quickly revenue might grow, and what margin range feels reasonable.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and turn that story into a forecast and a fair value estimate, then keep it updated automatically when new data arrives, such as analyst revisions, earnings results or news.</p> <p>That makes it easier for you to compare the Fair Value from your Narrative with Iron Mountain’s current share price and decide whether you view the stock as offering enough potential reward, too little, or something in between.</p> <p>For example, one Iron Mountain Narrative on the platform currently anchors on a fair value of about US$65.53 while another stretches to about US$160.00. This shows how two investors looking at the same business, from legacy storage risk on one side to information infrastructure opportunity on the other, can reach very different yet clearly framed views.</p> <p>For Iron Mountain, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Iron Mountain Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/xn8xw1oo-legacy-data-management-with-optionality-in-digital-and-infrastructure-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iron Mountain Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 32.3% below the narrative fair value based on the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: very large, reflecting a multi fold increase from the current base</p> <ul> <li>Frames Iron Mountain as a global information management REIT with deep exposure to regulated sectors like healthcare, financial services and government, where compliance needs and high switching costs support long contracts.</li> <li>Sees the combination of sticky physical storage and expanding digital and data center services as a hybrid model, with legacy assets supplying cash and newer offerings adding optionality and new revenue pillars.</li> <li>Argues that as customers upgrade infrastructure and refine data governance, Iron Mountain’s focus on secure colocation, digital transformation and lifecycle management can support meaningful growth in information infrastructure services.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/a5ubyqkq-falling-legacy-demand-will-burden-data-center-margins-1jbl?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iron Mountain Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$65.53</p> <p>Implied downside to this fair value: 38.4% below the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 9.19%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights the risk that faster cloud adoption and digital transformation reduce demand for legacy physical storage, while tougher competition and higher costs in data centers pressure margins.</li> <li>Points to ongoing capital needs, sustainability requirements and potential commoditization in data centers as factors that could strain free cash flow, leverage and pricing power over time.</li> <li>Bases its lower fair value on analyst assumptions for mid single digit revenue growth, higher future profit margins and a lower future P/E, arguing that current market expectations may already be demanding.</li> </ul> <p>If seeing both sides laid out like this helps you clarify your own view, the next step is to go straight to the full narratives, compare the assumptions with your expectations for Iron Mountain and decide which story feels closer to how you think the business can perform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Iron Mountain? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/IRM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This has put the insurer’s recent share performance under closer investor scrutiny.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings.</a></p> <p>While today’s sector wide selloff dragged Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings lower, its recent record tells a different story, with a 30 day share price return of 7.21% and a one year total shareholder return of 128.13% hinting that longer term momentum has been strong even after short term volatility.</p> <p>If this move in financials has you looking wider than a single insurer, it could be a good moment to scan the market for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">96 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings now trading at an intrinsic value premium and a strong multi year total return behind it, you have to ask: is there still upside here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings currently trades on a P/E of 24.7x, compared to a peer average of 17.8x and an Asian insurance sector average of 12x, which points to a rich valuation against both local and broader industry groups.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much investors are paying for each ₪1 of current earnings. For an insurer such as MGDL, a higher P/E often reflects expectations for steadier earnings quality, prospects for future profitability, or simply strong demand for the shares relative to recent earnings, even when near term profit trends are mixed.</p> <p>In MGDL’s case, the company is flagged as having high quality earnings and a modest 1.1% annual earnings growth rate over the past 5 years. However, earnings fell 56.9% over the last year and net profit margins declined from 10.6% to 2.1%. Against that backdrop, a 24.7x P/E suggests the market is placing a higher price on each unit of current earnings than on peers, despite recent pressure on profitability and a return on equity of 7.6% that is described as low.</p> <p>The comparison to the Asian insurance industry average P/E of 12x is even more stark. MGDL’s multiple is more than double that level, which signals that buyers are willing to pay a premium relative to regional insurers with lower P/E ratios. If the P/E were to move closer to those lower peer or regional averages, it would imply a very different price for the same earnings base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, there are clear risks, including the recent 56.9% earnings drop, the thinner 2.1% net margin, and a valuation premium that could unwind if sentiment cools.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view from the SWS DCF model</h2> <p>The P/E of 24.7x already looks full, but our DCF model paints an even starker picture, with an estimated future cash flow value of ₪7.35 versus the current price of ₪16.95.

The new US$1.00 billion buyback may support near term earnings per share and capital returns, but it does not materially change the key risk that slowing digital audience growth or weaker real estate activity could weigh on future revenue and margins.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development alongside the buyback is News Corp’s continued dividend of US$0.10 per share for the half year to December 31, 2025. Taken together, the dividend and repurchase authorization highlight a heavier emphasis on returning cash to shareholders at a time when digital real estate, data services, and subscription businesses remain central to the company’s growth and earnings story.</p> <p>But while higher capital returns may look appealing, investors also need to be aware of how concentrated earnings have become in a smaller set of core segments, and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-nwsa/news/m1rw3d8h-digital-information-and-real-estate-will-shape-a-strong-future-s4oy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on News (it's free!)</a></p><p>News’ narrative projects $9.3 billion revenue and $754.0 million earnings by 2028.

All of these factors feed into how investors think about its future cash flows and risk profile.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $97.2b. Analysts provide free cash flow estimates for several years ahead, and beyond that Simply Wall St extrapolates the path, with projected free cash flow reaching $325.1b in 2031 and continuing with further estimates out to 2035.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of $161.88 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 9.5% overvalued, which is a relatively small gap and suggests expectations and the cash flow outlook are broadly aligned.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>NVIDIA is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare the share price with the company’s profit today, without getting too deep into complex models.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative P/E range.</p> <p>NVIDIA currently trades on a P/E of 35.86x. That sits below the Semiconductor industry average of 43.84x and well below the peer average of 87.49x, which indicates the stock is priced more cautiously than many direct peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for NVIDIA is 54.79x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be appropriate given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because it weighs these company specific drivers, the Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 35.86x with the Fair Ratio of 54.79x suggests the shares trade below that fair range.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/08830e11-eecd-4a85-982d-b0ae1dfd6f7a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you decide if the stock now looks expensive, cheap or about in line with the story you believe.</p> <p>For NVIDIA, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, each Narrative links a clear story about the business to concrete numbers, so you can see how someone gets from their assumptions to a Fair Value per share. Here is how one bullish and one more cautious view stack up using that framework.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/391kfoxw-nvda-expanding-ai-demand-will-drive-major-data-center-investments-through-2026?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$253.02 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 30.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 30.90%</p> <ul> <li>The consensus style bull Narrative, titled \"NVDA: AI Infrastructure Supercycle Will Drive Multi-Year Data Center Leadership\", centers on NVIDIA as a core supplier for AI infrastructure, with demand coming from hyperscalers, sovereign AI projects and a widening range of industries.</li> <li>It leans on assumptions such as analyst forecasts for revenue to compound, higher profit margins over the next few years, a future P/E of 35.58x and a discount rate of around 10.49% to reach a Fair Value around US$253 per share.</li> <li>The author highlights both supportive factors such as platform leadership and full stack offerings, and risks such as export controls, custom accelerators from large customers, supply chain concentration and energy or regulatory constraints on large scale AI buildouts.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/81hhflx5-enterprise-hardware-segment-to-drive-sales-as-ai-takes-over?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$141.74 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 25.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 17.2%</p> <ul> <li>This Narrative, which applies a Fair Value around US$141.74, still sees NVIDIA well positioned in areas such as data centers, gaming GPUs, automotive platforms and Omniverse, but pairs that view with more conservative long term growth and margin assumptions.</li> <li>The author models a lower net margin of 40%, a future P/E of 60x and revenue growth of 17.2%, while also flagging factors that could restrain the outcome, including competition from AMD and Intel, pricing sensitivity for consumer GPUs, regulatory hurdles for deals and possible supply chain disruption.</li> <li>The update section adds NVLM 1.0 as a possible extra growth angle around open source multimodal models and a wider AI ecosystem, but treats it as upside optionality rather than something that changes the valuation inputs today.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two Narratives frame a realistic range of views that are both grounded in detailed assumptions rather than broad labels like \"cheap\" or \"expensive\".

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Carter's (CRI) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$925.5 million and basic EPS of US$1.76, alongside net income of US$64.2 million. This puts a clear spotlight on how effectively it is turning sales into profit. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$859.7 million and EPS of US$1.71 in Q4 2024 to US$925.5 million and EPS of US$1.76 in Q4 2025. Trailing twelve month revenue of US$2.9 billion and EPS of US$2.53 set the broader earnings backdrop.

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 3.2%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, Carter's net profit margin sits at 3.2%, compared with 6.3% a year earlier, and trailing twelve month net income is US$91.8 million on US$2.9b of revenue.</li> <li>Bears argue that margin pressure will stick because tariffs and cost inflation are lifting the effective duty rate into the high 30% range and Carter's is leaning on broad price increases to offset this, which they see as risky for a price sensitive young family customer base.\n    <ul> <li>This concern lines up with the drop in trailing margin from 6.3% to 3.2%, as higher duties and input costs can compress earnings even when revenue, at about US$2.9b, remains relatively stable over the last twelve months.</li> <li>Critics also point to the plan to close about 150 North American stores and reduce office based roles by roughly 15% as a sign the current store fleet and cost base are under pressure, and they question whether planned US$45 million of savings will be enough to offset those headwinds and support higher profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Carter's has seen EPS across 2025 quarters swing from US$0.01 in Q2 to US$1.76 in Q4, and bears are watching whether future cost savings truly reverse the visible squeeze in margins or simply keep earnings roughly in line with recent levels. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/x04win8h-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Carter's Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue Growth Slow, Earnings Forecasts Higher</h2> <ul> <li>Forecasts point to revenue growing around 1.1% per year while earnings are expected to grow about 9.7% per year, compared with five year earnings that have declined roughly 15% per year.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view think this gap between modest revenue growth and faster earnings growth can hold, because they see several levers working in Carter's favor, including digital channel expansion, store rationalization and product simplification.\n    <ul> <li>They highlight plans to reposition Carter's, OshKosh, Little Planet and Otter Avenue as primary brands on Amazon and other wholesale platforms, which they believe can lift higher value assortments and support Wholesale segment earnings even if total company revenue climbs only a little above the current US$2.9b level.</li> <li>Bulls also point to the planned US$45 million in annual productivity savings and the reduction of 20% to 30% of product choices, arguing that better inventory quality and a more efficient cost base can help translate low single digit revenue growth into the 9.7% earnings growth that is currently projected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to weigh this slow top line outlook against the earnings growth forecasts, it can help to see how bullish analysts connect Carter's cost actions and channel mix to their longer term story. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/k2mo6ka2-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Carter's Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 13.3x Versus DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>Carter's trades on a P/E of 13.3x compared with peers at 27.8x and the US Luxury industry at 21x, while a DCF fair value of US$13.94 sits well below the current share price of US$33.39.</li> <li>Consensus style analysis suggests this mix of low relative P/E and a DCF fair value below the market price gives investors two very different signals to weigh, especially when set alongside the long run earnings record.\n    <ul> <li>On one hand, the 13.3x P/E is lower than both peers and the broader US market at 19.6x, which is consistent with the idea that the stock appears inexpensive compared with similar companies even though trailing twelve month EPS is US$2.53 on net income of US$91.8 million.</li> <li>On the other hand, the DCF fair value of US$13.94 and the roughly 15% per year five year earnings decline highlight that, despite the lower P/E, longer term profit trends and cash flow estimates have been weaker, which is why some analysts are more cautious about how much upside is left from here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a

More recently, the shares show returns of 2.8% over the past week and 10.4% over the past month, with an 8.4% return year to date and 7.4% over the past year. This backdrop provides a recent performance snapshot as the company shifts direction under new management.</p> <p>For investors or watchers of NYSE:KR, the CEO transition combined with restructuring efforts indicates a period in which management decisions and execution may receive closer attention. It may be useful to monitor how Foran approaches store closures, cost cuts, and any changes in Kroger's operating priorities, and to consider how those developments fit with individual expectations and risk tolerance.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nyse-kr/kroger/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kroger</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>For you as an investor, this CEO change sits on top of several moving pieces for Kroger. Greg Foran brings large scale grocery and general merchandise experience from Walmart, which could be relevant as Kroger tightens its cost base, simplifies its structure, and closes underperforming locations. Those are sensitive moves in a low margin business where peers like Walmart, Costco, and Target are also pushing hard on price, private label, and e-commerce. At the same time, Kroger is investing in health focused offerings such as GLP-1 support programs and dietitian services, and continues to face mixed analyst views, including a recent downgrade to Equal Weight and lowered price target. The combination of leadership overhaul, restructuring and varied external opinions means execution and communication from the new CEO may matter more to how you interpret short and medium term developments.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kroger Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Foran’s appointment could support the existing narrative around tighter cost controls, automation, and store footprint review, as he has experience managing large store networks and operational efficiency at scale.</li> <li>Restructuring, store closures, and a leadership change after a board investigation may challenge earlier assumptions that cost optimization and store expansion would progress smoothly without governance or cultural friction.</li> <li>The increased focus on GLP-1 medication programs and broader wellness offerings is only partly reflected in the existing narrative and may add another dimension to Kroger’s health focused positioning over time.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/blqx7z7z-e-commerce-expansion-and-health-focus-will-strengthen-future-szdj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kroger</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Leadership turnover following a board investigation introduces uncertainty around culture, retention, and the pace of operational changes.</li> <li>⚠️ Store closures, restructuring, and heavy investment in digital and supply chain projects could pressure margins and free cash flow if benefits take longer than expected.</li> <li>🎁 Foran’s large format retail and grocery background may help align store portfolio, pricing, and operations with what has worked at other scale retailers.</li> <li>🎁 Kroger’s push into health and wellness services, including GLP-1 support, provides an additional way to differentiate versus competitors while using existing pharmacy and food infrastructure.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how quickly the new CEO sets out a clear plan for Kroger’s store footprint, cost base, and digital priorities, and whether that plan stays consistent through the upcoming earnings cycle. You may also want to track management updates on store closures versus new investments, commentary around margin pressures such as labor and technology spending, and how Kroger positions itself against Walmart, Costco, and Target on value and convenience.

The latest US$775.67 million equity raise via a forward sale slots directly into that story: it helps fund the planned US$38.00 billion of grid and clean‑energy infrastructure spending while also easing pressure on an already leveraged balance sheet. In the near term, that likely means the key catalysts remain regulatory decisions, execution on capital projects and continued dividend progression, while the main trade‑off is incremental dilution for existing shareholders. With the shares recently trading a little above consensus fair value and analysts broadly neutral, the offering itself does not look like a thesis‑changing event, but it does sharpen focus on funding costs, outage performance and future rate outcomes.</p> However, investors should be aware of how repeated equity raises could affect long term returns.\n\nConsolidated Edison's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/721aa817-6bdd-4ca3-aa2e-3117a6b10b23/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates cluster tightly around US$105 to US$108, hinting at limited perceived mispricing.

The latest quarter showed softer earnings despite higher full year revenue, while management kept returning capital through dividends and buybacks. In the near term, the key catalyst remains execution in fixed operations and EchoPark, with the biggest risk being pressure on margins if vehicle demand or pricing weakens further. The recent results do not appear to change that balance in a material way.</p> <p>The most relevant update here is Sonic’s continued share repurchases, with 600,000 shares bought back in the fourth quarter of 2025 for US$38.3 million, bringing total repurchases under the long running 2004 authorization to about US$1.16 billion. Set against lower full year 2025 net income and margins, this capital return sits alongside the US$0.38 per share dividend and frames how management is currently balancing near term earnings softness with shareholder distributions.</p> <p>Yet while capital returns may look reassuring, investors should be aware that rising new car prices and potential demand pressure in 2026 could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/retail/nyse-sah/sonic-automotive/djy1xoyy-us-auto-trends-will-fuel-expansion-in-fixed-operations-yw4n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sonic Automotive (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sonic Automotive's narrative projects $17.5 billion revenue and $310.7 million earnings by 2028.

This lines up with worries about earnings sensitivity when growth slows.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue stayed close to US$2.5b. The drop from a 6.9% to 4.2% net margin is therefore more about profitability than demand collapsing, which is exactly the pressure point bears focus on rather than a volume shock.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Globant's thinner 4.2% net margin and that Q2 loss are exactly the kind of numbers bears point to when they argue the business model is under pressure. It is worth seeing how that squares with a full Bear Case view in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/uppr7toe-ai-and-geopolitical-risks-will-limit-demand-yet-offer-hope-havg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Globant Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>One Off US$73.3m Loss Clouds Earnings Trend</h2> <ul> <li>The last 12 months included a one off loss of US$73.3 million, which weighed on the reported net income of US$102.9 million and on the 4.2% net margin figure investors are looking at today.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this large item masks the underlying earnings power, and the data gives them some talking points:\n    <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, three of the four quarters were profitable on a net income excluding extra items basis, adding up to US$102.9 million despite the drag from the one off. Bulls see this as more reflective of the ongoing run rate than the headline margin alone.</li> <li>Analysts in the bullish camp also point to forecast earnings growth of about 21.6% per year from this base, so they treat the US$73.3 million charge as a temporary hit rather than a permanent change in the business model that would keep margins at 4.2%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see that US$73.3 million one off charge as a speed bump rather than a reset of long term profitability, which is a key pillar of the Bull Case set out in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1hiaw3fa-ai-and-cloud-native-solutions-will-transform-global-work-models-zxut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Globant Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E Of 21.3x And DCF Fair Value Gap</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$49.76, Globant trades on a P/E of 21.3x, slightly above the 18.2x peer average and roughly in line with the US IT industry at 21x, while the supplied DCF fair value of US$101.78 sits well above the current price.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about a mixed risk and reward setup, and the current numbers show why views are split:\n    <ul> <li>On one side, the DCF fair value of US$101.78 implies a large gap to the share price. This lines up with the idea that the market may be underpricing the 21.6% forecast earnings growth even though revenue is only expected to grow about 4.7% per year.</li> <li>On the other, the higher than peer P/E together with a trailing net margin of 4.2% means today’s valuation is being asked to sit on top of relatively modest profitability. This is exactly what more cautious investors focus on when they question how much of that growth is already reflected in the multiple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Globant on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious signals leaves you on the fence, act while the data is fresh and weigh it against your own expectations, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Globant’s thinner 4.2% net margin, a recent quarterly loss and a one off US$73.3 million charge all raise questions about the consistency of its earnings power.</p> <p>If you are uneasy about paying up for that kind of earnings volatility, it is worth checking our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">76 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> to focus on companies with more stable profiles right now.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
