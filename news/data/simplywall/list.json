            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) has seen its stock fluctuate recently, moving down about 2% over the past month. Investors appear to be weighing the company's steady annual earnings growth in comparison to broader market shifts, fueling conversation about the current valuation.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-orly/oreilly-automotive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive.</a></p> <p>After a strong start to the year, O'Reilly Automotive’s recent 30-day share price return of -12.12% has cooled some of its earlier momentum. Even so, the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 21.99%. This pullback hints at shifting sentiment. It also follows a long run of robust long-term growth, so many investors are simply reassessing risks and expectations at these higher valuations.</p> <p>If you're curious how other parts of the market are performing right now, it's a smart moment to broaden your scope and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>The question now is whether O'Reilly Automotive's recent slide reveals an overlooked value, or if the market is simply factoring in all the growth that is yet to come.

Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Amrize (SWX:AMRZ) reported its net profit margin at 10%, edging higher than last year’s 9.5%, a clear sign of better profitability. Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Nippon Sanso Holdings (TSE:4091) just delivered its first-half earnings update, announcing higher revenue and a notable jump in net income. Following this performance, the company has raised both its interim and annual dividend forecasts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4091/nippon-sanso-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Nippon Sanso Holdings.</a></p> <p>Momentum around Nippon Sanso Holdings has been mixed this year. While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year. With strategic acquisitions and European growth adding substance to its outlook, the stock’s current market action appears to be a pause within a much bigger, multi-year climb.</p> <p>If you’re interested in uncovering more opportunities, now’s an ideal time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With fresh earnings growth, higher dividends, and continued expansion in Europe, the question now is whether Nippon Sanso Holdings is trading at an attractive valuation or if investors have already priced in its ambitions for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 4.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>The most widely followed narrative places Nippon Sanso Holdings' fair value at ¥5,332.86, which is about 5% higher than its last close of ¥5,073. This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso. Given its expertise and recent disciplined CapEx positioning, this could drive future revenue growth as delayed customer investment resumes, especially with policy and economic clarity.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/810soabx-clean-fuel-demand-and-semiconductor-expansion-will-transform-global-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What are the bold assumptions driving this valuation?

The company currently trades at 22.4 times earnings, which is higher than the peer average of 14.5 times and the industry’s 13.2 times. The fair ratio our analysis suggests is 20.4 times, meaning the stock is a bit expensive relative to where the market could drift. This introduces valuation risk if momentum fades.

Is this a real opportunity for buyers, or is investor optimism already factored in?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Sales Ratio of 14.5x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Netskope's current Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.5x, which is significantly higher than both its peers and the broader US Software industry. At a last close of $23.41, this premium valuation raises the question of whether investors are overestimating Netskope's potential compared to rivals.</p> <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current sales. It is often used for high-growth tech companies that may not yet be profitable. For expanding firms like Netskope, a higher multiple can reflect future growth expectations or strong market positioning. However, it may also indicate frothy sentiment if financial fundamentals lag behind those hopes.</p> <p>Specifically, Netskope's 14.5x P/S is almost double the peer group average of 7.5x and almost triple the US Software industry average of 5.4x. This sharp divergence suggests the market is either expecting superior growth or is currently overvaluing the company relative to peers, especially given that Netskope is not yet profitable.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 14.5x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, ongoing lack of profitability and a high valuation compared to peers could spark a turnaround if revenue growth slows or investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Netskope narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model Puts Valuation Into Question</h2> <p>Taking a different perspective with our SWS DCF model, Netskope appears even more stretched on valuation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions could be an undervalued gem or if the recent hype has stretched its price? You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Momentum has picked up over the last three years with a total shareholder return of 13.6%.

This process helps investors judge what a business is really worth, not just what the market says.</p> <p>For PulteGroup, the DCF model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company's Free Cash Flow for the last twelve months came in at $1.56 billion. Over the next decade, analyst estimates and projections show some growth ahead, with Free Cash Flows expected to reach around $2.01 billion in 2027. Simply Wall St extends these forecasts out to 2035, using consensus and extrapolated figures to build a fuller long-term picture.</p> <p>Based on this model, the intrinsic fair value for PulteGroup is calculated at $154.61 per share. This suggests the shares are 23.5% undervalued relative to the current market price, which indicates upside potential for new and existing investors. The model points to a margin of safety, and PulteGroup’s cash generation outlook supports a compelling value case at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PulteGroup is undervalued by 23.5%.

When companies generate steady profits, the PE ratio offers a direct look at how the market values their underlying earnings power.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio typically depends on both growth expectations and perceived risk. Companies with stronger growth prospects, more stable earnings, or lower risk tend to justify higher PE ratios. Businesses facing uncertainty or slower growth are often priced lower on this metric.</p> <p>PulteGroup’s current PE ratio stands at 8.8x, which is meaningfully lower than the Consumer Durables industry average of 10.6x and also below the average for similar peers at 14.1x. On the surface, this could signal that the stock is undervalued compared to the broader sector.</p> <p>To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for PulteGroup at 15.0x. This metric aims to capture more nuance than a simple peer or industry comparison by factoring in the company’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry dynamics, market cap, and unique risk profile. The Fair Ratio helps avoid common pitfalls of benchmarking and puts all the fundamental information into a context tailored for PulteGroup.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 15.0x to the actual PE of 8.8x highlights a significant undervaluation in the shares. It suggests the company is trading at a hefty discount even after considering all relevant risks and growth opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1386 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PulteGroup Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives, an innovative, story-driven approach that connects your perspective on a company, like PulteGroup, directly to its future financial forecasts and your estimated fair value.</p> <p>A Narrative is simply your story for a stock, combining your expectations for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins with your own reasoning and assumptions about the business. Instead of relying solely on formulas, Narratives let you personalize valuation by linking what you believe about PulteGroup’s strategy or market opportunity to concrete financial scenarios.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's Community page, millions of investors are already using Narratives as an easy and intuitive tool to guide buy or sell decisions. Narratives clearly lay out your fair value, compare it to the current price, and give immediate feedback as to whether you see the stock as undervalued, overvalued, or fairly priced.</p> <p>Importantly, Narratives are dynamic. As soon as news or new earnings arrive, your Narrative updates so your conclusions always reflect the latest information. For example, some investors use a Narrative that emphasizes sustained growth from Sunbelt migration and active adult communities, resulting in a bullish fair value as high as $163.00. Others highlight margin pressure and affordability challenges, leading to a much lower fair value near $98.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PulteGroup? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple. Such a wide premium suggests investors should take a hard look at the underlying growth assumptions that are driving KRMN's lofty valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Karman Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Preferred multiple of price-to-sales 28.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, signs of overvaluation and the stock trading below analyst price targets could trigger a sentiment shift if growth expectations are not fully realized.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Karman Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests Shares Are Overvalued</h2> <p>Looking at Karman Holdings through the lens of our SWS DCF model creates a starkly different picture.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.
