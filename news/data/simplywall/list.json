This has put the insurer’s recent share performance under closer investor scrutiny.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings.</a></p> <p>While today’s sector wide selloff dragged Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings lower, its recent record tells a different story, with a 30 day share price return of 7.21% and a one year total shareholder return of 128.13% hinting that longer term momentum has been strong even after short term volatility.</p> <p>If this move in financials has you looking wider than a single insurer, it could be a good moment to scan the market for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">96 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings now trading at an intrinsic value premium and a strong multi year total return behind it, you have to ask: is there still upside here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings currently trades on a P/E of 24.7x, compared to a peer average of 17.8x and an Asian insurance sector average of 12x, which points to a rich valuation against both local and broader industry groups.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much investors are paying for each ₪1 of current earnings. For an insurer such as MGDL, a higher P/E often reflects expectations for steadier earnings quality, prospects for future profitability, or simply strong demand for the shares relative to recent earnings, even when near term profit trends are mixed.</p> <p>In MGDL’s case, the company is flagged as having high quality earnings and a modest 1.1% annual earnings growth rate over the past 5 years. However, earnings fell 56.9% over the last year and net profit margins declined from 10.6% to 2.1%. Against that backdrop, a 24.7x P/E suggests the market is placing a higher price on each unit of current earnings than on peers, despite recent pressure on profitability and a return on equity of 7.6% that is described as low.</p> <p>The comparison to the Asian insurance industry average P/E of 12x is even more stark. MGDL’s multiple is more than double that level, which signals that buyers are willing to pay a premium relative to regional insurers with lower P/E ratios. If the P/E were to move closer to those lower peer or regional averages, it would imply a very different price for the same earnings base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, there are clear risks, including the recent 56.9% earnings drop, the thinner 2.1% net margin, and a valuation premium that could unwind if sentiment cools.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view from the SWS DCF model</h2> <p>The P/E of 24.7x already looks full, but our DCF model paints an even starker picture, with an estimated future cash flow value of ₪7.35 versus the current price of ₪16.95.

The new US$1.00 billion buyback may support near term earnings per share and capital returns, but it does not materially change the key risk that slowing digital audience growth or weaker real estate activity could weigh on future revenue and margins.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development alongside the buyback is News Corp’s continued dividend of US$0.10 per share for the half year to December 31, 2025. Taken together, the dividend and repurchase authorization highlight a heavier emphasis on returning cash to shareholders at a time when digital real estate, data services, and subscription businesses remain central to the company’s growth and earnings story.</p> <p>But while higher capital returns may look appealing, investors also need to be aware of how concentrated earnings have become in a smaller set of core segments, and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-nwsa/news/m1rw3d8h-digital-information-and-real-estate-will-shape-a-strong-future-s4oy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on News (it's free!)</a></p><p>News’ narrative projects $9.3 billion revenue and $754.0 million earnings by 2028.

The Q4 beat and upbeat Q1 guidance support the view that innovation-led growth remains the key near-term catalyst, while elevated legal costs around intellectual property and uncertainty in emergency medicine demand still look like the biggest swing risks. This latest quarter does not remove those risks, but it may ease some concerns around execution.</p> <p>The new US$600 million stock repurchase program is the announcement most directly tied to this earnings release, because it adds a more visible capital return angle to the story just as all three segments delivered 5% core sales growth. For investors focused on catalysts, that combination can sharpen attention on how quickly AptarGroup converts its innovation and operational improvements into consistent earnings and cash flow, even while legal expenses and softer pharma sub-segments remain in the background.</p> <p>Yet investors should also be aware that ongoing legal expenses and uncertain emergency medicine demand could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-atr/aptargroup/vuti6kyf-atr-expanded-partnership-agreements-will-drive-long-term-healthcare-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on AptarGroup (it's free!)</a></p><p>AptarGroup's narrative projects $4.3 billion revenue and $450.9 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-atr/aptargroup/vuti6kyf-atr-expanded-partnership-agreements-will-drive-long-term-healthcare-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how AptarGroup's forecasts yield a $161.43 fair value</a>, a 12% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-atr/aptargroup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ATR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ae10b1af-602a-4968-9eab-35a4eaca3c65/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ATR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>The lowest ranked analysts paint a much more cautious picture, assuming revenue of about US$4.1 billion and earnings near US$431 million by 2028, so you should compare that against this quarter’s stronger update and the potential impact of ongoing legal and regulatory pressures.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-atr/aptargroup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 4 other fair value estimates on AptarGroup</a> - why the stock might be worth 8% less than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

It is often used for early stage or loss making businesses where earnings are not yet meaningful. For a clinical stage biotech with no revenue and ongoing losses, a higher P/B can reflect how investors are weighing the company’s pipeline, expected future cash flows, and funding needs against its current balance sheet.</p> <p>Here, Cogent’s 11.4x P/B is described as good value relative to its peer average of 19.1x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock at a discount to similar names focused on comparable areas. At the same time, the same 11.4x is described as expensive versus the wider US biotechs industry average of 2.7x, meaning investors are currently assigning a much richer valuation than they are to the sector overall.</p> <p>Result: Price-to-Book of 11.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh the pipeline and valuation against clinical trial uncertainty and the ongoing net loss of US$328.937 million with no current revenue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Cogent Biosciences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If you are weighing the mix of strong past returns and a significant net loss, take a moment to review the key data and form your own view, including the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 3 important warning signs</a> that highlights what the market currently sees on both the risk and reward side.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If Cogent has you thinking more broadly about your portfolio, do not stop here, there are other stocks and themes worth putting on your radar right now.</p> <ul> <li>Target potential mispricings by scanning companies that look attractively valued on key fundamentals using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> before the crowd turns its attention to them.</li> <li>Strengthen your income stream by reviewing companies with higher yields and resilient payouts through the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15 dividend fortresses</a> so you are not relying on capital gains alone.</li> <li>Prioritise resilience by focusing on businesses with robust finances and consistent metrics via the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_solid_balance_sheet\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solid balance sheet and fundamentals stocks screener (39 results)</a>, rather than leaving your capital tied to weaker balance sheets.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over a longer stretch, a 26.2% 1 year total shareholder return and 53.0% 5 year total shareholder return indicate that investors who stayed invested through recent capital raises and earnings movements have, so far, been rewarded.</p> <p>If the AI linked power demand story has you looking beyond a single utility, this could be a good moment to scan <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting list of grid focused names to research next.</p> <p>So with Portland General Electric raising about US$480 million, reporting US$306 million in net income, and leaning into AI related demand, is the current share price offering value or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.1% Overvalued</h2> <p>Portland General Electric’s most followed narrative puts fair value at about $52.32, slightly below the last close of $53.96, which frames the current AI and PacifiCorp excitement as already largely reflected in the price.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Robust and sustained demand growth from industrial and data center customers is accelerating system wide electricity usage, underpinned by Oregon's strong technology sector and regional electrification objectives; this is expected to solidly grow PGE's revenue base and support long term earnings expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing transition to clean energy including major renewable procurements (2023 and 2025 RFPs) and battery storage integration position PGE to capitalize on declining renewable costs and federal tax credits, which should drive rate base growth, lower operational costs, and support future margin improvement.</em></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/dlz3g6mc-analyst-commentary-highlights-raised-targets-and-battery-storage-gains-for-portland-general-electric\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how steady demand, cleaner generation, and a higher future earnings multiple all fit into one price tag?

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $2.78b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest free cash flow reaching around $3.70b by 2030, with a path that moves through projected figures such as $2.81b in 2026 and $3.46b in 2029, all in US dollars.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $462.30 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $307, this implies a 33.6% discount, which indicates that the shares screen as undervalued under this particular set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Public Storage is undervalued by 33.6%.

It captures both what the business is earning today and how the market is weighing its prospects and risks.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more cautious multiple. The question is not whether a P/E is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Public Storage currently trades on a P/E of 33.99x. That sits above the Specialized REITs industry average of 15.86x, and below the peer group average of 41.55x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Public Storage is 34.36x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given the company’s earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it tries to account for the specific mix of growth, risk and profitability that is unique to Public Storage.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 33.99x very close to the Fair Ratio of 34.36x, the shares screen as ABOUT RIGHT on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Public Storage into a clear story that links its business outlook to a financial forecast, then to a fair value, all inside Simply Wall St’s Community page where millions of investors share their assumptions. You can compare a more upbeat view that leans toward the higher US$350 price target with a more cautious view closer to US$287, see how each Narrative’s fair value stacks up against today’s share price, and watch those fair values update automatically as new earnings, guidance or news come through. This can give you a practical framework to decide whether the current price lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Public Storage? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/PSA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $97.2b. Analysts provide free cash flow estimates for several years ahead, and beyond that Simply Wall St extrapolates the path, with projected free cash flow reaching $325.1b in 2031 and continuing with further estimates out to 2035.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of $161.88 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 9.5% overvalued, which is a relatively small gap and suggests expectations and the cash flow outlook are broadly aligned.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>NVIDIA is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare the share price with the company’s profit today, without getting too deep into complex models.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative P/E range.</p> <p>NVIDIA currently trades on a P/E of 35.86x. That sits below the Semiconductor industry average of 43.84x and well below the peer average of 87.49x, which indicates the stock is priced more cautiously than many direct peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for NVIDIA is 54.79x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be appropriate given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because it weighs these company specific drivers, the Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 35.86x with the Fair Ratio of 54.79x suggests the shares trade below that fair range.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/08830e11-eecd-4a85-982d-b0ae1dfd6f7a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you decide if the stock now looks expensive, cheap or about in line with the story you believe.</p> <p>For NVIDIA, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, each Narrative links a clear story about the business to concrete numbers, so you can see how someone gets from their assumptions to a Fair Value per share. Here is how one bullish and one more cautious view stack up using that framework.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/391kfoxw-nvda-expanding-ai-demand-will-drive-major-data-center-investments-through-2026?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$253.02 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 30.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 30.90%</p> <ul> <li>The consensus style bull Narrative, titled \"NVDA: AI Infrastructure Supercycle Will Drive Multi-Year Data Center Leadership\", centers on NVIDIA as a core supplier for AI infrastructure, with demand coming from hyperscalers, sovereign AI projects and a widening range of industries.</li> <li>It leans on assumptions such as analyst forecasts for revenue to compound, higher profit margins over the next few years, a future P/E of 35.58x and a discount rate of around 10.49% to reach a Fair Value around US$253 per share.</li> <li>The author highlights both supportive factors such as platform leadership and full stack offerings, and risks such as export controls, custom accelerators from large customers, supply chain concentration and energy or regulatory constraints on large scale AI buildouts.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/81hhflx5-enterprise-hardware-segment-to-drive-sales-as-ai-takes-over?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$141.74 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 25.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 17.2%</p> <ul> <li>This Narrative, which applies a Fair Value around US$141.74, still sees NVIDIA well positioned in areas such as data centers, gaming GPUs, automotive platforms and Omniverse, but pairs that view with more conservative long term growth and margin assumptions.</li> <li>The author models a lower net margin of 40%, a future P/E of 60x and revenue growth of 17.2%, while also flagging factors that could restrain the outcome, including competition from AMD and Intel, pricing sensitivity for consumer GPUs, regulatory hurdles for deals and possible supply chain disruption.</li> <li>The update section adds NVLM 1.0 as a possible extra growth angle around open source multimodal models and a wider AI ecosystem, but treats it as upside optionality rather than something that changes the valuation inputs today.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two Narratives frame a realistic range of views that are both grounded in detailed assumptions rather than broad labels like \"cheap\" or \"expensive\".

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Carter's (CRI) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$925.5 million and basic EPS of US$1.76, alongside net income of US$64.2 million. This puts a clear spotlight on how effectively it is turning sales into profit. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$859.7 million and EPS of US$1.71 in Q4 2024 to US$925.5 million and EPS of US$1.76 in Q4 2025. Trailing twelve month revenue of US$2.9 billion and EPS of US$2.53 set the broader earnings backdrop.

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 3.2%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, Carter's net profit margin sits at 3.2%, compared with 6.3% a year earlier, and trailing twelve month net income is US$91.8 million on US$2.9b of revenue.</li> <li>Bears argue that margin pressure will stick because tariffs and cost inflation are lifting the effective duty rate into the high 30% range and Carter's is leaning on broad price increases to offset this, which they see as risky for a price sensitive young family customer base.\n    <ul> <li>This concern lines up with the drop in trailing margin from 6.3% to 3.2%, as higher duties and input costs can compress earnings even when revenue, at about US$2.9b, remains relatively stable over the last twelve months.</li> <li>Critics also point to the plan to close about 150 North American stores and reduce office based roles by roughly 15% as a sign the current store fleet and cost base are under pressure, and they question whether planned US$45 million of savings will be enough to offset those headwinds and support higher profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Carter's has seen EPS across 2025 quarters swing from US$0.01 in Q2 to US$1.76 in Q4, and bears are watching whether future cost savings truly reverse the visible squeeze in margins or simply keep earnings roughly in line with recent levels. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/x04win8h-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Carter's Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue Growth Slow, Earnings Forecasts Higher</h2> <ul> <li>Forecasts point to revenue growing around 1.1% per year while earnings are expected to grow about 9.7% per year, compared with five year earnings that have declined roughly 15% per year.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view think this gap between modest revenue growth and faster earnings growth can hold, because they see several levers working in Carter's favor, including digital channel expansion, store rationalization and product simplification.\n    <ul> <li>They highlight plans to reposition Carter's, OshKosh, Little Planet and Otter Avenue as primary brands on Amazon and other wholesale platforms, which they believe can lift higher value assortments and support Wholesale segment earnings even if total company revenue climbs only a little above the current US$2.9b level.</li> <li>Bulls also point to the planned US$45 million in annual productivity savings and the reduction of 20% to 30% of product choices, arguing that better inventory quality and a more efficient cost base can help translate low single digit revenue growth into the 9.7% earnings growth that is currently projected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to weigh this slow top line outlook against the earnings growth forecasts, it can help to see how bullish analysts connect Carter's cost actions and channel mix to their longer term story. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/k2mo6ka2-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Carter's Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 13.3x Versus DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>Carter's trades on a P/E of 13.3x compared with peers at 27.8x and the US Luxury industry at 21x, while a DCF fair value of US$13.94 sits well below the current share price of US$33.39.</li> <li>Consensus style analysis suggests this mix of low relative P/E and a DCF fair value below the market price gives investors two very different signals to weigh, especially when set alongside the long run earnings record.\n    <ul> <li>On one hand, the 13.3x P/E is lower than both peers and the broader US market at 19.6x, which is consistent with the idea that the stock appears inexpensive compared with similar companies even though trailing twelve month EPS is US$2.53 on net income of US$91.8 million.</li> <li>On the other hand, the DCF fair value of US$13.94 and the roughly 15% per year five year earnings decline highlight that, despite the lower P/E, longer term profit trends and cash flow estimates have been weaker, which is why some analysts are more cautious about how much upside is left from here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether THOR Industries is offering good value at its current share price, or if the recent weakness is a warning sign, this article walks through the key numbers so you can judge for yourself.</li> <li>The stock closed at US$96.13, with returns of a 15.4% decline over 7 days, a 14.1% decline over 30 days and an 8.8% decline year to date. The 1 year return sits at a 1.1% decline and the 3 year return at 11.1%.</li> <li>These moves sit against a backdrop where THOR Industries has remained a well-followed name in the recreational vehicle space, with investors watching how its end markets and order trends evolve. Even without a single recent headline driving the share price, the stock's pullback and mixed longer term returns are prompting fresh questions about what a fair price really looks like now.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, THOR Industries scores 4 out of 6 for potential undervaluation, giving it a current value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>.

It is essentially asking what THOR Industries’ future cash generation is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For THOR Industries, the model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, starting from last twelve months free cash flow of about US$356.2 million. Analyst and extrapolated projections then step this forward, with free cash flow estimates such as US$272.1 million in 2026 and US$609.9 million in 2035, all in US$. Simply Wall St only takes direct analyst inputs for the earlier years, with later years extrapolated to build a full 10 year path.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows back to today results in an estimated intrinsic value of about US$108.19 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$96.13, the model implies the stock is 11.1% undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests THOR Industries is undervalued by 11.1%.

It rolls expectations about future growth and perceived risk into a single number, since higher growth or lower risk often line up with a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth or higher risk tend to justify a lower one.</p> <p>THOR Industries is trading on a P/E of 18.01x. That sits close to the Auto industry average P/E of 18.98x, and below the peer group average of 21.45x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 18.65x for THOR Industries. This figure reflects factors such as the company’s earnings profile, profit margin, industry, market cap and risk characteristics, rather than just a simple comparison with peers.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than looking at raw industry or peer multiples alone. With the current P/E of 18.01x versus a Fair Ratio of 18.65x, THOR Industries appears modestly undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:THO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2f032b8c-b6dd-4481-9a58-556393e7be3f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:THO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might assume stronger conditions and produce a fair value comfortably above it, showing how different perspectives can coexist on the same stock.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for THOR Industries? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/THO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:THO 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2f032b8c-b6dd-4481-9a58-556393e7be3f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:THO 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest Q4 2025 numbers and record US$978 million in full-year earnings, alongside a higher US$0.18 dividend and completed US$46.1 million buyback, reinforce the short term catalyst around capital returns and balance sheet strength, rather than fundamentally altering the story. The recent share price surge and a price target only modestly above the market suggest expectations are already elevated, which makes execution on 2026 production plans and projects like La Colorada Skarn more important.

With the share price up strongly over the past year and the stock already trading at a premium multiple, this earnings beat looks more like confirmation than a game changer. The bigger swing factors remain structural: the company’s negative equity position, reliance on strong franchisee economics and a dividend that is not well covered by free cash flow.</p> However, one of these structural issues could quickly matter more than the latest EPS uptick.\n\nWinmark's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 47% below fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-wina/winmark/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out if it's a bargain</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-wina/winmark\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"WINA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/33e0522f-da6e-4dde-a0e1-1c6d17f1b8cc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>WINA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> A single Simply Wall St Community fair value estimate sits at US$310.07, below recent trading levels.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Swedbank is still reasonably priced after a strong run, this article will walk through what the current share price might be implying about its value.</li> <li>Swedbank's share price, which last closed at SEK 347.8, has seen a 0.3% decline over the past week, a 0.3% gain over the past month, a 6.9% return year to date and a 47.1% return over the past year, with a 101.6% return over three years and a 212.3% return over five years.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Swedbank has focused on its position in the Swedish banking sector and ongoing interest in the wider Nordic financials space, which helps frame how investors are thinking about bank valuations generally.

The model applies an Average Return on Equity of 14.28% and a Cost of Equity of SEK12.56 per share. The gap between these two is the Excess Return, calculated at SEK16.19 per share, which is what this approach treats as value created over and above the required return.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value used in the model is SEK201.21 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. Combining these inputs produces an Excess Returns intrinsic value of roughly SEK569 per share. Compared with the recent share price of SEK347.8, this framework points to the stock trading at a 38.9% discount, which screens as undervalued on this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Swedbank is undervalued by 38.9%.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher “normal” P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull a fair P/E lower.</p> <p>Swedbank currently trades on a P/E of 11.92x. That sits slightly above the Banks industry average of 11.09x and also above the peer group average of 11.49x, so on simple comparisons the shares are not screening as cheap. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 12.02x for Swedbank. This is the P/E level suggested after factoring in elements like its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a straight peer or industry comparison because it is tailored to the company rather than relying on broad group averages.</p> <p>Set against the current P/E of 11.92x, the Fair Ratio of 12.02x is very close, which points to the shares being priced roughly in line with this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d68ba17d-9030-4dd5-bcd5-1c64af8b3dbf/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This way you can instantly see how your Fair Value compares to the current price and decide whether the share looks appealing, whether you prefer a cautious view closer to SEK 213.52 per share or a more optimistic stance around SEK 390 per share.</p> <p>For Swedbank, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Swedbank Narratives:</p> <p>First is a more optimistic take that leans toward a higher fair value and assumes that Swedbank can keep turning its retail and corporate banking footprint into steady business across Sweden and the Baltics.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/pvtd2lw8-long-term-digital-and-sustainability-trends-will-support-a-stronger-banking-franchise?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Swedbank Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 390.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this narrative: 10.8% below the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 5.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish view is based on Swedbank executing on its 15/27 plan, using stronger customer engagement and tighter cost control to support earnings through a lower cost to income ratio.</li> <li>It also relies on steady volume growth in core lending, including Swedish mortgages and Baltic lending, together with rising contributions from savings, pensions and asset management fees.</li> <li>This narrative assumes investors will be comfortable with Swedbank trading on a future P/E of 14.6x on 2029 earnings, with earnings projected at SEK 36.0b and a discount rate of 6.24% used to bring those numbers back to today.</li> </ul> <p>The second is a more cautious narrative that points to a lower fair value and focuses on what happens if interest income and revenue do not keep pace with current expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/d2z4fsdh-swedbank-kommer-oka-langsiktigt-tack-vare-hogkonjuktur?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Swedbank Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 213.52 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this narrative: 62.8% above the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 6.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>This bearish view starts from the idea that Swedish mortgage rates could settle nearer 3% from around 4.5%, which would feed through to lower interest income from mortgages and a smaller total revenue base.</li> <li>In this scenario, Swedbank’s total revenue moves from SEK 74.4b to SEK 63.0b, partly offset by about 10% growth in other services tied to the policy rate.</li> <li>From there, the narrative outlines a path where revenue recovers over three years to SEK 88.0b, but the starting point is a lower fair value of SEK 213.52 per share, which is based on a future P/E of 7.79 and a higher discount rate of 8.92%.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two narratives frame the current price between a more optimistic SEK 390.00 view and a more cautious SEK 213.52 view, allowing you to consider which set of assumptions comes closer to how you see Swedbank’s earnings power and risk profile.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?
