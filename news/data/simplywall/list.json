Over recent halves the company has seen revenue move from A$45.5 million in H2 2024 to A$65.4 million in H1 2025 and A$22.4 million in H2 2025. Basic EPS has shifted from a loss of A$0.14 per share in H2 2024 to a loss of A$0.12 in H1 2025 and a profit of A$1.34 in H2 2025.

This suggests recent news is being viewed as a significant shift in growth prospects and risk profile rather than a short term move.</p> <p>If this AI server and cooling story has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to look across the wider theme through our screen of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential contenders in the same structural trend.</p> <p>With the shares up sharply and trading slightly above the latest analyst price target, yet showing a large intrinsic discount on some models, the key question is whether 2CRSI is still mispriced or if the market is already pricing in years of growth.</p> <h2>Price to sales premium versus fair value and peers</h2> <p>On the numbers provided, 2CRSI looks inexpensive against the SWS DCF estimate yet expensive on its preferred multiple, which is the P/S ratio. The share last closed at €27.70, while the SWS DCF model estimates a future cash flow value of €53.34, and the shares are described as trading 48.1% below that fair value.</p> <p>The SWS DCF model works by projecting future cash flows for the business and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. That approach tries to capture the specific earnings profile of 2CRSI, including factors such as forecast revenue and profit growth, rather than just comparing it to other tech names using a simple market multiple.</p> <p>Set against that, the preferred multiple being used here is the P/S ratio, which currently sits at 2.8x for 2CRSI. This is described as expensive compared to an estimated fair P/S ratio of 0.6x, and also expensive against the European tech industry average P/S of 0.7x, even though it is below a selected peer group average P/S of 4.3x. That mix of signals shows the market is already paying more per euro of sales than broad sector and regression based benchmarks, while still assigning a lower tag than some direct peers.</p> <p>Put simply, the P/S of 2.8x stands well above both the 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average. That represents strong relative pricing that investors will want to weigh against the large DCF gap. If the market ever moves closer to the SWS fair P/S level suggested by the regression work, that would imply a very different share price than today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for 2CRSI</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-sales of 2.8x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also need to factor in execution risks around turning €220.857m of revenue into stronger profitability, as well as the recent rapid share price swings.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this 2CRSI narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on what the price implies</h2> <p>While the P/S of 2.8x looks rich against a 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average, the SWS DCF model points the other way, with a fair value of €53.34 versus the current €27.70, described as 48.1% below fair value.

The latest earnings beat and return to profitability strengthen the case that scale and higher storage attachment can support margins, but the biggest near term swing factor is still access to affordable capital, while long term policy uncertainty around incentives remains a key overhang. This quarter’s results do not remove those risks, but they do improve Sunrun’s financial footing.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is Sunrun’s completion of the PG&amp;E Local PeakShift Power season, where over 1,000 customer systems delivered nearly 1,200 hours of highly accurate dispatch. Paired with storage attachment rates reaching 71% by year end 2025, this grid services performance gives more substance to the idea that batteries and virtual power plants could become a meaningful earnings driver, potentially offsetting some pressure from expiring tax credits and higher financing costs over time.</p> <p>Yet while the profit rebound is encouraging, investors should also be aware that concentrated policy risk around solar tax credits could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunrun (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunrun's narrative projects $2.9 billion revenue and $465.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunrun's forecasts yield a $22.74 fair value</a>, a 11% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa2a4c7-de78-47ca-906e-c5edae8a6116/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this surprise profit, the most bearish analysts assumed almost flat revenue growth near US$2.1 billion and no profitability, so their far more cautious view of Sunrun’s financing and policy risks may shift meaningfully as investors reassess those assumptions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Sunrun</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model. It updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive, and is available on the Community page where millions of investors share their own versions.</p> <p>For example, one National Energy Services Reunited Narrative might align with the bullish analyst fair value of US$30.00, built around confidence in hydraulic fracturing capacity and MENA contracts. Another could sit nearer the cautious US$10.00 view that focuses on regional concentration and energy transition risks. Seeing those side by side can help you decide whether the current US$25.14 price is above or below the story you find most convincing.</p> <p>For National Energy Services Reunited, here are previews of two leading National Energy Services Reunited narratives that may help frame the discussion:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/lj4o0x5w-rising-mena-demand-will-boost-oilfield-service-expansion-mfij?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 National Energy Services Reunited Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 16.1% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 19.65% a year</p> <ul> <li>Supports a higher fair value case built around hydraulic fracturing scale in Saudi Arabia, contract visibility across MENA and higher profit margins tied to technology and efficiency gains.</li> <li>Assumes National Energy Services Reunited can sustain robust revenue growth and margin expansion, with future earnings and P/E considered consistent with a US$30.00 anchor valuation.</li> <li>Notes meaningful risks from oilfield concentration, regional exposure and capital intensity, so the optimistic outcome still depends on execution and stable operating conditions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/1sh65zqm-revenue-recovery-and-sector-rebound-will-drive-long-term-shareholder-returns?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 National Energy Services Reunited Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this more cautious narrative: US$22.14 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 13.5% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.93% a year</p> <ul> <li>Frames the story around solid MENA contracts and Jafurah exposure, but anchors fair value closer to US$22.14, even with updated analyst targets around US$30.</li> <li>Builds in steady revenue growth and margin improvement, while assuming a more modest future P/E multiple compared with the bullish view.</li> <li>Highlights contract concentration, capital demands, working capital strain and long term energy transition as key risks that could keep the share price nearer this fair value.</li> </ul> <p>Viewed together, these narratives provide two different sets of assumptions for National Energy Services Reunited that can be compared with the current US$25.14 share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for National Energy Services Reunited? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/NESR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Revenue of US$51.34 million and a reduced but still sizeable net loss of US$40.16 million underscore the tension between growing top line and the risk that R&amp;D and commercial spend remain high if label expansions in adult GvHD, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic low back pain take longer than expected to translate into meaningful sales.</p> <p>Yet against this improving revenue picture, the risk that slower Ryoncil uptake or trial delays could still force fresh capital raises is something investors should be aware of...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/pharmaceuticals-biotech/asx-msb/mesoblast-shares/tz4l8krr-update-for-mesoblast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Mesoblast (it's free!)</a></p><p>Mesoblast's narrative projects $485.4 million revenue and $222.1 million earnings by 2029.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $343.7 million. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2030, with free cash flow projections moving from a loss of $146 million in 2026 and $13 million in 2027, to positive cash flows of $143 million in 2028, $231 million in 2029 and $313 million in 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates further free cash flow estimates out to 2035 using its own growth assumptions.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $23.63 per share. Compared with the recent share price around $3.79, this implies the stock is about 84.0% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iovance Biotherapeutics is undervalued by 84.0%.

Slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower one. That is why it helps to look at Iovance Biotherapeutics in the context of both its industry and its own fundamentals.</p> <p>Iovance Biotherapeutics currently trades on a P/S of 5.93x. This sits below the Biotechs industry average of 12.58x and also below the peer average of 6.82x provided. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the company is 4.19x, which is an estimate of the P/S multiple that might be reasonable given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Compared with simple peer or industry comparisons, the Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored to the company’s profile.</p> <p>Putting that together, Iovance Biotherapeutics’ actual P/S of 5.93x is above the Fair Ratio of 4.19x, which points to the shares pricing in a richer multiple than this framework suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/af2848b1-cfd3-42ac-adb3-fafd0b7d60eb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This allows you to compare that fair value with the current share price to help decide if the stock looks attractive or stretched on your assumptions.</p> <p>Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as company announcements, earnings or analyst revisions appear, you are not locked into a static view. You can quickly see how fresh data shifts the fair value output linked to your story.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, one investor might build a cautious Narrative anchored around a US$1.00 fair value while another might build an optimistic Narrative around US$20.00. By setting out the revenue, earnings and P/E assumptions behind each, you can decide which version feels closer to your own view or adjust the inputs to create something in between.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Iovance Biotherapeutics Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/13svd0s7-amtagvi-and-new-til-will-meet-aging-global-demand?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$17.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 78% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 56.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes Amtagvi adoption, broader patient access, and efficiency gains support higher revenue and a turnaround from losses to profit over the next few years.</li> <li>Builds in a higher profit margin and a future P/E of 75.10x, which is well above the current US Biotechs industry P/E referenced earlier in the article.</li> <li>Anchors on a Fair Value of US$17.00, based on bullish analyst assumptions for revenue of US$1.0b and earnings of US$126.3m by 2028, discounted back at about 7.11%.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/jv6qnzu7-rising-interest-rates-and-dilution-will-stifle-til-progress?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$2.00 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 89% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 43.28% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes slower commercialization, high costs, complex distribution, and pressure from drug pricing scrutiny and interest rates, with continued execution risk.</li> <li>Uses a lower profit margin of 3.20% and a future P/E of 50.65x, while still baking in material revenue growth from Amtagvi and the pipeline.</li> <li>Arrives at a Fair Value of US$2.00 per share, reflecting a cautious view that the market may be pricing in more growth and profitability than these assumptions support.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame the recent US$3.79 share price between a bullish fair value of US$17.00 and a bearish fair value of US$2.00.

This naturally raises questions about growth potential and changes in perceived risk.</li> <li>Recent news around the metals and mining sector, including attention on materials linked to energy transition themes and supply security, has kept investors focused on companies like Sumitomo Metal Mining.

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extends those projections further out. In this case, free cash flow is projected at ¥82,950.00m by the year ending March 2030, with ten year forecasts combining analyst inputs for the nearer years and extrapolated estimates thereafter. All figures are expressed in ¥ and discounted using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about ¥6,259 per share. Compared with the recent share price of ¥12,650, the model implies the stock is around 102.1% above this estimate, which points to a valuation that is rich relative to these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sumitomo Metal Mining may be overvalued by 102.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 20 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Sumitomo Metal Mining.</a></p> <h2>Approach 2: Sumitomo Metal Mining Price vs Earnings</h2> <p>For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each unit of earnings. A higher P/E usually reflects higher market expectations for future earnings or a lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E often aligns with more modest expectations or higher perceived risk.</p> <p>Sumitomo Metal Mining currently trades on a P/E of 36.0x. That sits above the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 14.5x and also above the peer group average of 34.9x. On simple comparisons, the market is assigning a richer earnings multiple to the stock than to the broader industry and its peer set.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sumitomo Metal Mining is 21.7x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a more “normal” P/E might look like for the company, taking into account factors such as earnings growth profile, profit margins, size, industry and stock specific risks. Because it blends these elements rather than relying only on broad peer or industry averages, the Fair Ratio can provide a more tailored reference point.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 21.7x with the current P/E of 36.0x suggests the shares are trading well above this earnings based reference level.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you see how different assumptions translate into different fair values.</p> <p>Once you have a Narrative, you can compare its Fair Value to the current share price. This can help you decide whether the market price looks attractive, stretched or somewhere in between, based on your own assumptions rather than only a single model output.</p> <p>Narratives also update when new information such as news or earnings is added to the platform, so your story and fair value can stay aligned with the latest data instead of becoming stale.</p> <p>For Sumitomo Metal Mining, one investor might build a Narrative with relatively cautious revenue growth and margins, while another might assume stronger demand and profitability.

That implies an average Return on Equity of 15.62% on a Stable Book Value of US$23.44 per share, which comes from estimates by 5 analysts.</p> <p>The required return for shareholders, or Cost of Equity, is set at US$2.19 per share. The difference between what the company is expected to earn and this required return is the Excess Return, estimated at US$1.47 per share. The model then projects these excess returns forward and discounts them back to arrive at an intrinsic value of about US$48.13 per share.</p> <p>Against the recent share price of US$36.85, this implies the stock is around 23.4% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital is undervalued by 23.4%.

It gives you a quick sense of how many years of current earnings the market is effectively pricing in.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends a lot on growth expectations and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or more predictable cash flows can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Right now, HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital trades on a P/E of 23.97x. That sits above the Diversified Financial industry average of about 16.57x and above the peer average of 10.99x, so on simple comparisons the shares look more expensive than many alternatives.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is designed to refine that picture. Its Fair P/E of 15.36x for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital reflects factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks, rather than just broad peer or industry groupings. Because it ties the multiple directly to these fundamentals, it can provide a more tailored benchmark than raw averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 23.97x with the Fair Ratio of 15.36x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, a Narrative is your own explanation behind the numbers, where you set assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform converts that into a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help you assess whether the stock looks worth buying, holding or selling. Narratives are not static, they update when fresh information such as news or earnings is added, so your fair value view can move with the company’s story. For example, one HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Narrative might assume stronger project growth and assign a higher fair value, while another might assume more conservative funding conditions and arrive at a lower fair value.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HASI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This supports the idea of stronger profitability but also raises the question of how repeatable that combination is if project mix or costs shift.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/ZQM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Soilbuild Construction Group.</strong></a></p> <h2>EPS and profits step up each half</h2> <ul> <li>At the half year level, net income rose from S$7.4 million in 1H 2024 to S$19.2 million in 2H 2024 and S$28.3 million in 1H 2025, while basic EPS moved from S$0.0125 to S$0.0290 and then to S$0.0427 over the same three halves.</li> <li>Bulls point to this steady step up as a sign of improving earnings quality, and the trailing basic EPS of S$0.3845 versus the latest half year EPS of S$0.0427 highlights how much of the past year’s profit came from outside just this single half. Bullish investors may see this as helpful support for the view that the recent strength is not tied to a one off quarter, even though future periods will still need to back that up.</li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 10.6x versus peers at 20x</h2> <ul> <li>With the share price at S$1.02 and the provided P/E at 10.6x, the stock is described as trading below both the cited peer average P/E of 20x and the SG construction industry average of 14.2x, and also below the DCF fair value of about S$3.00.</li> <li>Supporters of a bullish stance argue that this lower multiple, alongside trailing net income of S$63.6 million and a 10.8% margin, supports the case that investors are paying less for each dollar of recent earnings. The cited forecasts of roughly 10.2% earnings growth and 12.4% revenue growth also indicate that expectations are not zero, so the valuation still assumes the business can at least hold close to its current profitability.</li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

At Comfort Systems USA, the CFO and two directors monetised shares shortly after the company reported very strong fourth quarter and full year 2025 numbers, highlighted an expanded US$11.94b backlog, and saw its stock move to very high levels. The CFO’s sale was sizeable in dollar terms, which tends to draw extra attention, especially when the stock has posted very large multi year returns and is trading near its highs. At the same time, Comfort Systems has just lifted its quarterly dividend from US$0.60 to US$0.70, which points to management confidence in the company’s cash generation. For you, the tension is between insiders taking some money off the table and a business that has just reported strong earnings, raised its dividend, and is deeply involved in data center and technology related projects that many investors view as long term themes.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Comfort Systems USA Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The record earnings, large backlog and stronger dividend fit with the narrative of Comfort Systems USA benefiting from reshoring capex, modular construction and technology driven projects.</li> <li>Heavy insider selling, particularly by the CFO, touches on one of the risks in the narrative that concentrates a lot of growth in large, complex technology and data center projects, which could face sector specific slowdowns.</li> <li>The increased focus on AI infrastructure and data centers, and the recent index inclusion, go further than the earlier narrative, which focused mainly on modular construction, reshoring and service revenue.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l6px86ww-industrial-reshoring-and-modular-demand-will-drive-results-into-2026\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Comfort Systems USA</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Concentration in technology and data center projects could become a problem if those end markets slow, given the size of the current backlog tied to these areas.</li> <li>⚠️ Recent significant insider selling, including by the CFO, breaks a pattern of limited insider selling over prior quarters and may signal that management sees the current share price as an attractive level to trim exposure.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings and revenue for 2025 were much higher than a year earlier, and the backlog of US$11.94b provides multi year visibility across mechanical, electrical and modular projects.</li> <li>🎁 The higher quarterly dividend of US$0.70 per share suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still funding growth in modular and service operations.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on the pattern of insider activity, not just one off sales. Repeated large disposals across several executives could carry a different signal to occasional profit taking. It is also worth tracking how much of the US$11.94b backlog is tied to technology and data center work versus more diversified commercial and industrial projects, as that mix affects both risk and margin potential. Finally, watch how Comfort Systems USA converts that backlog into revenue and cash flow while supporting higher dividends and any future capital returns, especially as it competes with other large contractors such as EMCOR Group and Quanta Services for complex projects.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Comfort Systems USA, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/FIX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Comfort Systems USA</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For Faraday Copper, this high P/B multiple is sitting against a backdrop of no reported revenue, a net loss of CA$25.97m and forecasts that the company will remain unprofitable over the next three years.</p> <p>Against its direct peers, Faraday Copper screens as good value on this metric, with its 20.9x P/B sitting below the peer average of 44.6x. However, when you widen the lens to the broader Canadian metals and mining industry, which sits at 3.8x, the same 20.9x looks expensive, suggesting the market is applying a much richer multiple than the wider group.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price to book of 20.9x (ABOUT RIGHT versus peers, OVERVALUED versus the wider industry)</strong></p> <p>However, you are still backing an exploration stage company with no revenue and a CA$25.97m net loss, so funding conditions or project setbacks could quickly challenge this pricing.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Faraday Copper narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If this all feels finely balanced, it makes sense to look at the numbers yourself and move quickly to shape your own view.
