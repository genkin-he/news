            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Nippon Sanso Holdings (TSE:4091) just delivered its first-half earnings update, announcing higher revenue and a notable jump in net income. Following this performance, the company has raised both its interim and annual dividend forecasts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4091/nippon-sanso-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Nippon Sanso Holdings.</a></p> <p>Momentum around Nippon Sanso Holdings has been mixed this year. While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year. With strategic acquisitions and European growth adding substance to its outlook, the stock’s current market action appears to be a pause within a much bigger, multi-year climb.</p> <p>If you’re interested in uncovering more opportunities, now’s an ideal time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With fresh earnings growth, higher dividends, and continued expansion in Europe, the question now is whether Nippon Sanso Holdings is trading at an attractive valuation or if investors have already priced in its ambitions for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 4.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>The most widely followed narrative places Nippon Sanso Holdings' fair value at ¥5,332.86, which is about 5% higher than its last close of ¥5,073. This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso. Given its expertise and recent disciplined CapEx positioning, this could drive future revenue growth as delayed customer investment resumes, especially with policy and economic clarity.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/810soabx-clean-fuel-demand-and-semiconductor-expansion-will-transform-global-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What are the bold assumptions driving this valuation?

The company currently trades at 22.4 times earnings, which is higher than the peer average of 14.5 times and the industry’s 13.2 times. The fair ratio our analysis suggests is 20.4 times, meaning the stock is a bit expensive relative to where the market could drift. This introduces valuation risk if momentum fades.

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat. While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant. This EUR 60 million investment is central to Metsä Board’s strategy of boosting product quality and supporting its transition to fossil-free production, underscoring the company’s push for cost efficiency and alignment with long-term sustainability trends that underpin revenue recovery prospects.\n</p> <p> But with European demand still sluggish and restructuring ongoing, investors should be mindful that even well-executed upgrades cannot fully offset...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fi/materials/hel-metsb/metsa-board-oyj-shares/pd0x5y6d-cost-efficiency-and-fiber-packaging-will-drive-long-term-success-dfbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Metsä Board Oyj (it's free!)</a></p><p>Metsä Board Oyj’s narrative projects €2.1 billion revenue and €124.4 million earnings by 2028.

You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

To calculate this metric for Wienerberger, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.073 = €346m ÷ (€6.3b - €1.6b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Wienerberger has an ROCE of 7.3%.</strong> On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 7.2%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Wienerberger </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/416194-roce-1-dark-2/1761827143455\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">WBAG:WIE Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Wienerberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

The company has employed 36% more capital in the last  five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 7.3%.   Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.   </p><h2> Our Take On Wienerberger's ROCE </h2><p> In conclusion, Wienerberger has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.

The Q3 2025 results reinforce MercadoLibre's user growth and revenue momentum, though EPS missed due to higher spending on shipping, marketing, and credit, underscoring that the biggest short-term catalyst remains fintech user growth, and the risk of rising credit losses is still front of mind. The recent results confirm these themes without materially shifting near-term risks or opportunities.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement is MercadoLibre’s Q3 earnings report, which showed revenue up 39% year-over-year, outpacing forecasts and fueled by a surge in unique active buyers and strong adoption of Mercado Pago’s services. This growth supports the key catalyst of accelerating fintech and payments adoption, but also highlights the company’s increased exposure to credit risk and the challenges of maintaining margins as credit and logistics investments scale.</p> <p>However, investors should be aware that rapid growth in the credit portfolio, while fueling revenue, exposes MercadoLibre to unexpected spikes in delinquency and ...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre/ez5w8rcx-digital-retail-and-mercadopago-adoption-will-fuel-future-markets-b0pt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MercadoLibre (it's free!)</a></p><p>MercadoLibre's narrative projects $46.9 billion revenue and $5.1 billion earnings by 2028.

This narrative is based on both sector momentum and a dramatic re-rating of future earnings potential, which could be a turning point for ambitious investors.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ondas anticipates record revenue growth in 2025, primarily driven by Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS), due to significant backlog and expanding programs with Optimus and Iron Drone systems in defense and homeland security sectors. This will directly impact revenue.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jb11frfj-analyst-optimism-grows-for-ondas-holdings-amid-strong-sector-momentum-and-upward-valuation-revisions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious about what’s fueling this bullish take?

The company’s price-to-book ratio stands at 26x, much higher than both the US Communications industry average of 2.3x and its peer average of 11.8x. This signals that investors are paying a steep premium compared to the broader sector, which could mean higher valuation risk if growth stumbles.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Expro Group Holdings to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Expro Group Holdings' Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Expro Group Holdings' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Expro Group Holdings' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     Furthermore, it has done a great job growing EPS over the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    In terms of investment risks, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>we've identified 1 warning sign </strong>with Expro Group Holdings</a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Expro Group Holdings' profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

However, investors may find appeal in its attractive dividend, a favorable price-to-sales ratio relative to peers, and forecasts for above-average profit growth.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for BXP.</a> <p>Next, we will see how these earnings figures compare with the most widely held market narratives and whether the numbers reinforce or challenge the current story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/p9cdwcmx-gateway-office-demand-and-disposition-plans-will-shape-performance-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about BXP</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/66909603-076c-4562-bb5f-8014d41ea084/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Margin Expansion Forecast: Analysts See Net Margin Rising From 0.1% to 10%</h2> <ul> <li>Profit margins are projected to rise sharply over the next three years, from a negligible 0.1% today to 10% by 2028, as BXP targets a transition back to sustained profitability.</li> <li>Analysts’ consensus view expects margin growth will be driven by:\n    <ul> <li>A “flight to quality” trend is leading to higher occupancy rates and premium rents for BXP’s centrally located, modern assets.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it’s gotten too pricey? Let’s dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco’s new store openings and bold expansion plans. These moves reinforce its reputation for consistent growth. The excitement around its international push and updated membership offerings has investors debating whether recent price moves reflect new opportunities or fresh risks.</li> <li>Costco currently lands a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. By several standard checks, this suggests it may be fully valued or even pricey right now. Let’s break down exactly how we arrive at that score in the next section and, even more importantly, look at what makes for a smarter way to judge value that goes beyond traditional methods.</li> </ul> <p>Costco Wholesale scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today’s dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco’s intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company’s current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company’s share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry’s average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco’s stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco’s PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco’s case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco’s current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco’s current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio. This means that, even after considering Costco’s growth, margins, and market-leading position, the stock appears to be overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1382 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers—such as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks—to your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company’s real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This suggests investors are weighing near-term housing headwinds against the company’s longer-term track record.

This suggests a mild upside and frames the company's valuation debate for investors interested in what is driving analyst optimism.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>KB Home is executing a land investment strategy that is increasing their lot position while returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases.

Its 1-month share price return sits at 31.8%, with a remarkable 98.9% rise year-to-date. Short-term momentum is clearly building, and the company’s 3-year total shareholder return of 172.9% shows how investor interest can gather pace when exploration milestones suggest deeper value may be unlocked.</p> <p>If you’re keen to expand your shortlist beyond resources, now’s a smart time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But with FireFly’s share price already surging following recent drilling results, does the stock still offer value at current levels?

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly’s elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project. Unless rapid progress and commercialisation materialise, such a premium can be hard to sustain.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, negative earnings and reliance on optimistic asset valuations mean that any operational setbacks could quickly pressure FireFly Metals’ premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FireFly Metals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Deep Discount on SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-book ratio suggests FireFly Metals is expensive compared to its industry, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

This could cap ARPU and slow subscriber acquisition, negatively impacting top-line growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/3omtzrem-low-cost-competition-and-high-capex-will-weaken-latin-american-networks-74lm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know which future financial levers analysts are betting on?

Momentum has faded recently as investors digest the company’s growth story and consider whether risk perception around the stock is beginning to shift.</p> <p>If you’re looking to spot the next breakout, now is a great moment to expand your investing universe and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares down and fundamentals still showing double-digit growth, investors are left wondering if this dip signals a genuine undervaluation or if the market has already factored in all of Vital Farms’ future prospects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 33.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>Vital Farms' most-followed narrative suggests there is a sizeable gap between its consensus fair value and the recent close price. With the consensus fair value at $52.60 and a last close of $34.89, the stock is viewed as deeply discounted by the narrative’s proponents. This sets the stage for a look at the factors fueling that call.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Significant expansion of farm and production network, including acceleration of CapEx to build out capacity (two production lines at the Seymour, Indiana facility and additional cold storage), positions Vital Farms to fully capitalize on unmet/pent-up demand. This would remove prior supply constraints and unlock further revenue and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Can expansion alone propel Vital Farms to the narrative's ambitious targets? The real twist is in the underlying expectations for outpaced earnings growth, margin leverage, and a premium multiple rarely seen outside high-growth sectors. Uncover which bold assumptions push this price target so far above consensus and what it would take for the fair value case to actually play out.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $52.60 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, heavy capital spending or disappointing demand growth could pressure margins and profits, which could quickly challenge the optimistic valuation narrative for Vital Farms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Vital Farms narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: The Market’s Multiple</h2> <p>Taking a look at valuation through the lens of the price-to-earnings ratio tells a different story. Vital Farms trades at 30.2x earnings, which is above both the US Food industry average of 18.5x and its peer average of 30.7x. Notably, this is also higher than the fair ratio of 23.3x that the market could move toward. This suggests some valuation risk, despite strong fundamentals.

The company’s net profit margin has edged down to 3.8% from last year’s 3.9%, and over the past five years, earnings have declined at an annual rate of 8.2%, with negative earnings growth most recently reported. Investors are weighing the company’s good relative value, highlighted by its Price-to-Earnings ratio of 10.8x against peers and the broader industry, against continued revenue and profit underperformance.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for KomeriLtd.</a> <p>Next up, we will see how these headline numbers stack up against the narratives shaping investor sentiment.

This demonstrates resilience as the broader specialty retail sector faces ongoing cost headwinds.</li> <li>Investor commentary highlights Komeri’s reliable operations and steady cash flows even as industry competition intensifies.\n    <ul> <li>The steady margin performance positions Komeri as a lower-risk, defensive choice. This is especially valued when sector peers have reported steeper margin compression amid inflation.</li> <li>While margin stability is seen as a strength, the modest 0.1 percentage point decline indicates that securing future profitability will depend on ongoing operational improvements, not just defensive positioning.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Discount Signals Underlying Value Debate</h2> <ul> <li>Shares trade at ¥3,200, a 59% premium to the DCF fair value estimate of ¥2,007.03. The company’s P/E of 10.8x is attractively below peers and industry averages.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis points out that while Komeri looks undervalued on earnings compared to competitors, the significant DCF premium raises debate over whether the share price already reflects all its defensive advantages.\n    <ul> <li>This valuation tension spotlights Komeri’s appeal as a “good value” pick for relative P/E shoppers, but leaves room for debate on whether the broader market is overlooking risks tied to lagging growth rates and past earnings declines.</li> <li>Investors weighing value versus growth must reconcile the company’s below-peer P/E and defensive cash generation with the gap to intrinsic value implied by discounted cash flows.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Five-Year Earnings Slide Raises Bar for Improvement</h2> <ul> <li>Earnings have declined by an annual rate of 8.2% over the last five years, and the latest period also saw negative growth. This extends a multi-year pattern of underperformance compared to market averages.</li> <li>Despite commendable cost management, broader market observers caution that continued declines amplify the importance of management executing on digital upgrades and margin stabilization.\n    <ul> <li>Some see Komeri’s steady dividend and focus on operational improvements as important, but argue that these have yet to reverse the entrenched earnings downtrend that positions the company as a “reliable but slow” performer compared to more dynamic peers.</li> <li>With revenue and earnings growth forecasts still trailing the Japanese market, calls for bold execution are growing louder among investors who want evidence that management can deliver a meaningful turnaround.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on KomeriLtd's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.
