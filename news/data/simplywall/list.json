Year to date, the move sits near a 9% decline, even though the 1 year total return is about 19%.\n</p> <p> Longer term performance has been weaker, with the 3 year total return around a 46% decline and the 5 year total return near a 29% decline. For investors, that contrast with the recent 1 year gain can raise questions about how durable any recovery might be.\n</p> <p> On the operations side, JinkoSolar reports annual revenue of roughly CN¥68,641.592 and net income of about CN¥3,421.823 loss, both stated in its reporting currency. The company also reports annual revenue growth of about 18% and net income growth that is very large relative to the prior year, while earnings remain in loss territory.\n</p> <p> For context, JinkoSolar designs and produces a wide range of photovoltaic products, including solar modules, wafers, cells, recovered silicon materials, and ingots, and also provides solar system integration, EPC services, energy storage systems, and solar power projects. As of December 31, 2024, it reports integrated annual capacity of 120 gigawatts for mono wafers, 95 gigawatts for solar cells, and 130 gigawatts for solar modules, serving customers in China, the United States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, multiple Middle Eastern markets, Europe, and other regions.\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-jks/jinkosolar-holding\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for JinkoSolar Holding.</a></p> <p> Recent trading has been soft, with a 1 day share price decline of about 4.4% and a year to date share price decline near 9.5%. At the same time, the 1 year total shareholder return is roughly a 19% gain, which suggests that momentum has cooled following a stronger stretch for investors who held through the volatility.\n</p> <p> If this has you reassessing opportunities around the energy transition, it could be a good moment to scan our screener of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> for ideas beyond solar alone.\n</p> <p> With the shares trading around $25.29, a value score of 5, and a reported discount to analyst price targets plus a large intrinsic discount, is JinkoSolar quietly cheap here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 28.2% Undervalued</h2> <p> The most followed narrative currently pegs JinkoSolar Holding’s fair value at $35.23 versus the recent close around $25.29.

Its 5 year total shareholder return of 306.23% points to momentum that has played out over a longer horizon as the market weighs its earnings outlook and sensitivity to natural gas and LNG trends.</p> <p>If this earnings update has you thinking about other energy related opportunities, now could be a time to scan our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_nuclear_renaissance\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473644/nuclear-renaissance/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">84 nuclear energy infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting point for further ideas.</p> <p>With the share price down 16.35% over 90 days yet still carrying a 5 year total return above 300%, the key question now is whether Advantage Energy is trading below its worth or if the market is already pricing in future growth potential.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 29.1% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Advantage Energy last closing at CA$10.44 against a narrative fair value of CA$14.73, the current setup frames a clear valuation gap for investors to assess.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The anticipated ramp-up of LNG Canada export capacity is expected to ease oversupply and improve regional natural gas pricing for Western Canadian producers, which could meaningfully increase realized revenues and enhance earnings for Advantage Energy.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/spwg6yia-lng-canada-exports-will-revitalize-western-canadian-gas-markets-bg67\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to see what is baked into that CA$14.73 figure? The narrative leans heavily on faster revenue growth, fatter margins, and a re rated earnings multiple. Curious how those ingredients line up across the next few years? The full breakdown spells out the assumptions behind that valuation gap.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$14.73 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/spwg6yia-lng-canada-exports-will-revitalize-western-canadian-gas-markets-bg67\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this depends on AECO price swings and ongoing NGTL pipeline constraints not intensifying, as both could pressure revenues and squeeze margins.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-aav/advantage-energy-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Advantage Energy narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another Angle on Valuation</h2> <p>The narrative points to a 29.1% discount to fair value at CA$14.73, but the current P/E of 28.8x sends a different signal. That multiple sits above the Canadian oil and gas industry at 17.2x, the peer average at 23x, and even the fair ratio of 26.3x. This suggests there may be less room for error if earnings disappoint.</p> <p>Put simply, the outlook for future cash flows appears attractive, yet the current earnings multiple already looks elevated relative to both peers and that fair ratio. When you think about risk, which lens do you place more weight on: the long term cash flow model, or the comparison with today’s earnings?</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-aav/advantage-energy-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/energy/tsx-aav/advantage-energy-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:AAV P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/846b3b28-2d64-4cfc-b26f-6a53535ac138/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:AAV P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If this mix of opportunity and concern feels familiar, it may be a good time to review the numbers yourself and decide where you stand.

Recent results show 7.8% year over year revenue growth, 5.6% comparable store sales growth, and a 12% rise in operating profit dollars, but also higher SG&amp;A from inflation in healthcare and casualty claims. When you combine that with cautious full year guidance that fell short of analyst expectations, it helps explain why management may be prioritizing scale, service reach, and digital convenience to support future comparable sales and operating margins.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The O'Reilly Automotive Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The faster expansion and omnichannel plans line up with the narrative focus on inventory depth and distribution reach, which is framed as a way to keep service levels high and support same store sales resilience.</li> <li>Rising cost pressure in SG&amp;A, plus weaker DIY demand due to tariffs and inflation, pushes against the narrative assumption that margins can remain steady while the company continues to expand.</li> <li>The specific acceleration to 225 to 235 new stores in 2026 and the emphasis on professional strength are not fully captured in the earlier narrative, which focuses more on store growth generally and trade related sourcing shifts.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/n8vnl9et-orly-improving-supply-chain-will-drive-resilient-same-store-sales-strength\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for O'Reilly Automotive</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Higher SG&amp;A from inflation in healthcare, casualty claims, and store level costs could pressure O'Reilly's 19.5% operating margin if not offset by stronger sales or efficiency gains.</li> <li>⚠️ A weakening DIY segment, influenced by tariffs and inflation, may be a drag on growth if pro demand slows or if competitors like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts compete harder on price or service.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings grew by 6.3% over the past year and are forecast to grow 6.13% per year, which supports the idea that the dual market model and distribution network are still driving profit growth.</li> <li>🎁 The plan to add 225 to 235 stores in 2026 and the strong professional business create more touchpoints with customers, which can support same store sales and help spread fixed costs across a larger base.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch whether the 2026 store cohort and omnichannel investments translate into healthy comparable store sales across both DIY and professional customers, not just headline revenue growth. Keep an eye on how SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales moves, since inflation in healthcare and other store expenses has already been a pressure point. It is also worth tracking how the DIY segment behaves if tariffs or inflation stay elevated, and how O'Reilly's execution compares with peers like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts on inventory availability, delivery times, and digital ordering.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for O'Reilly Automotive, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ORLY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for O'Reilly Automotive</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest results show narrower losses and modest revenue growth, but the key near term catalyst remains whether Claritev can keep reducing losses while stabilizing its balance sheet. The biggest risk is still its dependence on a few large payor and TPA relationships, and this update does not materially change that.</p> <p>The new US$75 million share repurchase program, capped at US$20 million per year through 2030, is the most relevant announcement here. It intersects directly with the near term focus on cost control and cash generation, since buybacks will draw on cash on hand and operating cash flows. For investors, the real test is whether Claritev can support this program while funding ongoing AI, cloud, and international initiatives that underpin its longer term growth catalysts.</p> <p>Yet even with shrinking losses and a buyback in place, investors still need to weigh the concentration risk in Claritev’s largest client contracts and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-ctev/claritev/tkit8a2w-analysts-boost-claritev-valuation-amid-growth-optimism-and-strategic-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Claritev (it's free!)</a></p><p>Claritev's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $90.0 million earnings by 2028.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 36.6% and very large 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns suggest momentum has been building over several years rather than just in the latest rally.</p> <p>If Chartwell’s run has you thinking more broadly about where capital could work hardest next, it may be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 healthcare AI stocks</a> for fresh ideas across the sector.</p> <p>With Chartwell generating revenue of CA$1.11b and net income of CA$29.41m, and trading only slightly below a CA$23.70 analyst price target, it is worth asking whether there is still a buying opportunity here or whether the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, Chartwell’s fair value comes out at CA$23.05, a touch above the CA$22.22 last close. This puts the focus on what assumptions are doing the heavy lifting.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chartwell's financial results and guidance point to a sustained increase in demand for senior housing, driven by a rapidly growing seniors population and persistent supply constraints, supporting rising occupancy and driving long term revenue and NOI growth. The company is executing on a strategy of acquiring and developing newer, larger, and more operationally efficient properties expected to produce higher occupancy rates, greater per suite NOI, and enhanced margins as lease ups mature.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what sits behind that CA$23.05 figure? The narrative leans on robust top line expansion, firmer margins, and a rich future earnings multiple that is described as anything but conservative.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$23.05 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the picture could change if elevated leverage and refinancing costs squeeze margins, or if higher labour expenses erode the modest profit improvements that analysts are banking on.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/healthcare/tsx-csh.un/chartwell-retirement-residences-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Chartwell Retirement Residences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle: rich sales multiple vs fair ratio</h2> <p>The AI fair value story leans toward modest undervaluation, but the sales multiple tells a different tale. Chartwell trades on a P/S of 6.4x, far above the North American Healthcare industry at 1.2x and peers at 1.3x, and well ahead of its own fair ratio of 3.5x.</p> <p>That gap suggests the market is already paying a premium for future growth. This leaves less room for error if margins, interest costs or occupancy do not line up with expectations.

Right now, the most important near term catalyst is clarity from the accounting probe, because it directly affects confidence in Nidec’s reported margins and cash flows. The biggest risk is that any control weaknesses or legal findings prove deeper than currently known and weigh on profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the latest Q3 earnings beat and upgraded guidance matter because they show progress on margin stabilization in industrial motors and automotive, which sits at the core of the restructuring story. Stronger earnings and cash flow provide more flexibility for Nidec to keep investing in motors for data centers and EVs while absorbing any near term costs related to governance reforms and potential compliance fixes.</p> <p>Yet investors should also be aware that the ongoing trade compliance investigations could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/jp/capital-goods/tse-6594/nidec-shares/ahdigll5-6594-new-arkansas-expansion-will-drive-positive-momentum-into-2027\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Nidec (it's free!)</a></p><p>Nidec's narrative projects ¥2,893.2 billion revenue and ¥247.5 billion earnings by 2028.

Hoplamazian as the new Chairman, concentrating leadership in a single figure.</li> <li>The transition highlights both succession planning and governance considerations for the company.</li> </ul> <p>For you as an investor, the key point is that Hyatt Hotels operates as a global hospitality company, with its results closely tied to travel demand, corporate bookings, and leisure trends. Leadership shifts at a company like this can matter because capital allocation, brand priorities, and risk oversight typically flow through the boardroom.</p> <p>The decision to move Mark S. Hoplamazian into the Chairman role suggests Hyatt is aiming for continuity while addressing reputational and governance questions head on.

Watch for disclosures on reputational and governance topics in future filings or shareholder communications, and whether the company adjusts its risk oversight frameworks. On the business side, track how consistently leadership executes on the asset light model and development goals while managing financial risks that analysts have already flagged. Comparing Hyatt’s progress against large peers over the next few years can help you judge whether this leadership setup is helping or hindering execution.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Hyatt Hotels, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/H\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Hyatt Hotels</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Warby Parker at around US$25.01 is priced for its brand story or for its actual fundamentals? This article breaks down what the current share price may be implying about value.</li> <li>The stock has had a mixed run, with a 5.5% return over the past week, a 2.0% decline over the last 30 days, a 10.6% return year to date and a 1.1% return over the past year, while the 3 year return sits at 100.4%.</li> <li>Recent headlines around Warby Parker have focused on its position in the US eyewear retail market and its progress as an established direct to consumer brand. This helps frame how investors are thinking about growth opportunities and business risks. These themes are often front of mind for the market when a consumer name like this sees shifts in sentiment and share price.</li> <li>On our checklist based valuation model, Warby Parker currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 out of 6</a> on undervaluation checks.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $41.1 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations feed into a ten year path where projected free cash flow reaches $177.2 million in 2030, with intermediate years such as 2026 to 2029 ranging from $60.6 million to $145.7 million before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back and added up, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $29.19 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $25.01, this implies the stock is roughly 14.3% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Warby Parker is undervalued by 14.3%.

Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often go with a lower one.</p> <p>Warby Parker currently trades at a P/S of 3.51x. That sits above the Specialty Retail industry average P/S of 0.46x and below the peer group average of 5.32x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Warby Parker is 1.74x, which is its view of what the P/S could be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the sector because it tries to line up the multiple with the company’s own profile rather than broad group averages. With the current 3.51x P/S versus a Fair Ratio of 1.74x, the shares screen as trading above that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out a clear story for Warby Parker, link that story to your own revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, and end up with a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on Simply Wall St's Community page, used by millions of investors.</p> <p>A Narrative connects what you think is happening in the business to a financial forecast and then to a Fair Value. It updates automatically when new information like earnings or news, such as the appointment of a new CFO or progress on AI glasses, is added to the platform.</p> <p>For example, one investor might build a more optimistic Warby Parker Narrative with a Fair Value of US$32.00, while another might lean on a more cautious Narrative with a Fair Value of US$18.00. Comparing either of those to the latest market price can help you judge whether the stock looks expensive, cheap, or close to your own view of fair.</p> <p>For Warby Parker however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Warby Parker Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties a clear story to specific assumptions on revenue, margins and valuation. Use them as starting points, not answers, and decide which feels closer to how you see the business.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/ebv0lo7c-google-partnership-and-retail-expansion-will-unlock-new-market-opportunities-hp9u?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Warby Parker Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$27.25</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at US$25.01: around 8%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.78% per year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes expansion of retail stores, shop in shops and eye care services supports higher active customers, higher average revenue per customer and better margins over time.</li> <li>Bakes in an AI and wearable tech angle, including the Google partnership and digital tools, as a way to open up new, higher margin revenue streams and improve efficiency.</li> <li>Accepts execution and competition risks, but treats current pricing as broadly in line with analyst expectations for revenue of about US$1.2b and higher earnings over the next few years.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/y2hgxha2-update-for-warby-parker?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Warby Parker Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$18.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at US$25.01: around 39%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 13.63% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on the risk that AI glasses, heavy store growth and higher fixed costs do not translate into enough incremental profit, which could leave margins under pressure.</li> <li>Flags competition, insurance mix and reduced owned programs like home try on as potential headwinds for average revenue per customer and repeat engagement.</li> <li>Takes the low end of analyst price targets as a guide, viewing the current share price as baking in expectations that may be too optimistic relative to these risks.</li> </ul> <p>Both narratives use analyst style assumptions, but they reach very different conclusions on what counts as a reasonable price for the same cash flows. The real value for you is in deciding which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Warby Parker's growth, profitability and risk, then adjusting the numbers until the story and the valuation line up.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Warby Parker? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/WRBY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest full-year 2025 results show higher revenue and net income, with basic EPS up to US$1.37, which helps validate that story after a flatter profit track record. The affirmed US$0.09 quarterly dividend reinforces a message of stability rather than signaling any major shift in capital allocation, so it is unlikely to change the near term catalysts in a material way. Instead, the more immediate focus remains on how the company manages input costs, protects margins, and justifies a relatively rich earnings multiple after a strong 12‑month total return. The recent results support confidence, but they also raise the bar for expectations.</p> However, that higher valuation makes any stumble on margins or demand more painful for shareholders to absorb.\nTootsie Roll Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 10%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9f8185b7-359c-4591-99fd-ca67babeda42/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Simply Wall St Community members currently offer just one fair value view at about US$38.53, giving you a single reference point rather than a broad range of opinions.

The latest results reinforce that 2025 was a record year, but the asset impairment and continued supply chain constraints do not materially change the near term catalyst, which remains execution on growth projects without eroding margins, nor the key risk around capital intensity and equipment availability.</p> <p>The pending acquisition of Distributed Power Solutions is the most relevant update here, because it extends Kodiak’s contracted horsepower model into power generation right as management is working through long equipment lead times. If DPS integrates smoothly and Kodiak secures enough new units on acceptable terms, the combination could support revenue and earnings growth, but any misstep on procurement or deployment timing would feed directly into the existing risk around capital intensity and potential overcapacity.</p> <p>Yet beneath Kodiak’s record 2025 numbers, investors should still be watching how its highly capital intensive model copes with...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-kgs/kodiak-gas-services/cieb1ckz-permian-basin-and-lng-exports-will-unlock-future-opportunities-gevd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Kodiak Gas Services (it's free!)</a></p><p>Kodiak Gas Services' narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $293.4 million earnings by 2028.
