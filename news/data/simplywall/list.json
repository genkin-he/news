While ENTRA1 Energy’s potential US$25 billion funding under the US-Japan Framework boosts overall sector confidence, the most important short-term catalyst, securing firm customer deployment and contracts, remains directly tied to NuScale’s project execution, and the core risk of delays in commercialization is largely unchanged by this announcement.\n</p> <p> Among NuScale’s recent announcements, the September 2025 agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of SMR capacity is most relevant. It directly reinforces the scale of customer commitment underpinning the substantial capital now potentially available through ENTRA1, highlighting the importance of NuScale’s ability to turn partnership momentum into tangible revenue-generating projects.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that the complexity of securing long-term customer agreements remains a fundamental source of risk, and without these…\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-smr/nuscale-power/64bqs928-analysts-weigh-nuscale-power-valuation-amid-smr-milestones-and-revised-price-targets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on NuScale Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>NuScale Power is projected to reach $402.3 million in revenue and $42.2 million in earnings by 2028.

This creates a runway for double-digit sales increases in fast growth end markets and supports sustained above-GDP revenue growth. Ongoing digital transformation in industrial sectors and the proliferation of IoT applications are expanding the need for custom sensors and embedded technologies. Standex's ramped-up R&amp;D and layered new product launches are expected to compound organic growth and provide higher-margin revenue streams, underpinning multi-year operating and net margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/z9jhyfdh-automation-and-electrification-will-strengthen-future-market-resilience-24bh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want the full story behind this hefty premium?

Despite solid historical profitability and high-quality earnings, forward-looking growth rates and recent compression in net margins, paired with a premium valuation, give investors plenty to consider this earnings season.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Kirby.</a> <p>The next section puts Kirby's results head-to-head with the popular market narratives to reveal where expectations line up and where investor assumptions might face new challenges.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Kirby</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/35154fdf-b7c7-4a38-b012-29fc4c0387af/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Analyst Price Target Offers 15.6% Upside to Current Price</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby's share price sits at $104.33, notably below the analyst price target of $120.60, representing potential upside of about 15.6% from current levels if analyst forecasts play out.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that for shares to reach the $120.60 target, Kirby must achieve projected revenue growth averaging 6.1% per year and expand profit margins from 9.3% to 11.4% by 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This scenario assumes earnings climb to $445.6 million over the next four years, matching analysts' expectations for consistent multi-year growth and market share gains.</li> <li>To justify the price target, Kirby would need to trade at a forward PE of 16.5x in 2028, which is nearly double the industry average of 8.4x. This suggests ongoing investor confidence in its premium positioning and strategic tailwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Consensus narrative says Kirby’s numbers have to keep stacking up.

Even if Kirby meets earnings targets, its shares need to hold above today’s sector-wide valuation to fulfill upward price expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Industry Tailwinds vs. Market Growth Rates</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby’s revenue is forecast to grow at 4.8% per year, which lags significantly behind the broader US market’s expected 10.3% annual revenue growth. This is a sign its end-markets remain solid but are not keeping pace with wider economic sectors.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that limited vessel supply, data center investment, and U.S. manufacturing reshoring may help Kirby maintain steady utilization and revenue visibility despite softer chemical demand.\n    <ul> <li>Offsetting these strengths, the consensus view cautions that Kirby’s dependence on the petrochemical market, ongoing cost pressures, and limited international diversification could constrain top-line expansion and earnings stability if the US economic cycle weakens.</li> <li>This tension means that even with powerful industry trends at its back, Kirby’s outlook is inevitably tied to the health of cyclical chemical demand and capital expenditures by US industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Kirby on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you have a unique perspective on Kirby’s results?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.  That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least.     </p><p> After losing 3.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Redeia Corporación (BME:RED) is forecasting earnings growth of 5.23% per year and expects revenue to rise 4.8% annually, which is ahead of the broader Spanish market's 4.2% growth outlook. Despite these positive projections, the company's net profit margin has slipped from 33.6% to 30%, and reported earnings have decreased at a rate of 5.5% per year over the last five years. Although the stock is trading at a premium, with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 16.6x that surpasses both its peers (14.9x) and the industry average (13.3x), the current share price of €15.61 also remains above the estimated fair value of €13.75.

These factors help counter the recent drop in net profit margin.</li> <li>New regulatory incentives and higher projected EBITDA indicate that long-term investments could help stabilize or lift profitability, even as capital expenditure ramps up.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rising Capital Investment, Rising Risks</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia plans average annual capital expenditures of at least €1.5 billion through 2028, well above previous levels and industry norms, with major projects reinforcing the Spanish power network and interconnections.</li> <li> The consensus narrative notes that these heavy investments grow the regulated asset base and strengthen future revenue streams, yet bring notable risk:\n    <ul> <li>Operational and financial stress is cited as a risk. Ambitious spending could overload balance sheet leverage and pressure free cash flow if subsidies or disposals do not materialize as planned.</li> <li>S&amp;P's placement of Redeia on negative CreditWatch underscores the concern that costly upgrades and regulatory uncertainty may elevate credit risk and funding costs over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Stays Stretched Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia's current share price (€15.61) sits well above the DCF fair value estimate of €13.75 and implies a PE ratio of 16.6x, higher than both its peer group (14.9x) and the European Electric Utilities sector (13.3x).</li> <li> Analysts’ consensus view underscores the persistent premium. To match the long-term analyst price target of €17.86, investors must believe in sustained robust growth and margin recovery.\n    <ul> <li>The requirement for Redeia to trade at 19.5x PE on 2028 earnings shows the valuation is already baking in meaningful upside. This may leave little margin for error if growth or regulation disappoints.</li> <li>This premium reflects optimism about investment-led gains but creates valuation sensitivity if margin improvements or capital returns lag expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Analyst forecasts and fundamental trends show Redeia's profile is defined by the balancing act between ambitious, capex-driven growth and the risks of cost overruns, margin pressure, and valuation stretch.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Redeia Corporación Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Redeia Corporación on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Want to interpret the data through your own lens?

This potentially suggests undervaluation against current sector norms and the company's recent closing price of ¥1,515.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio compares the company’s market price to its earnings per share. For utilities like Kyushu Electric, this multiple is commonly used to assess if investors are paying a reasonable price for current profits given the industry’s stable but often low-growth characteristics.</p> <p>The company’s P/E of 5.4x is less than half the Japanese market’s average of 14.4x and significantly below the Asian electric utilities industry average of 17.1x. This indicates that the market may be underpricing its earnings potential. However, when compared to direct peers, Kyushu Electric appears somewhat more expensive than the peer average of 4.3x. Regression analysis also estimates a fair P/E ratio for Kyushu Electric at 8.5x, emphasizing that current market pricing remains conservative relative to what could be justified by fundamentals.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9508/kyushu-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kyushu Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 5.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain.

The recent Sanofi transfer brings some immediate revenue opportunity through milestone payments, but it does not remove the near-term dependency on external partners delivering regulatory and commercial successes. Short-term momentum could hinge on the pace and consistency of these milestone flows, while the main risk remains a slowdown or deferral of such payments that would challenge Novavax’s cash flow and earnings projections.\n</p> <p> One recent development relevant to this pivot is the expanded collaboration with Sanofi to use Matrix-M in their pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, underscoring Novavax’s intent to monetize its platform beyond COVID-19. These partnership agreements could become key revenue levers, but dependable cash generation still relies heavily on timely regulatory and commercial achievements by both Novavax and its larger partners.\n</p> <p> However, in contrast to the promise of partnership-driven revenue, investors should also remain mindful that if partner milestones underperform or arrive late, the impact on liquidity and growth could be...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-nvax/novavax/peugv6f6-confidence-in-licensing-shift-and-partnerships-will-drive-opportunities-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Novavax (it's free!)</a></p><p>Novavax's outlook suggests revenues of $348.5 million and earnings of $55.9 million by 2028.
