This potentially suggests undervaluation against current sector norms and the company's recent closing price of ¥1,515.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio compares the company’s market price to its earnings per share. For utilities like Kyushu Electric, this multiple is commonly used to assess if investors are paying a reasonable price for current profits given the industry’s stable but often low-growth characteristics.</p> <p>The company’s P/E of 5.4x is less than half the Japanese market’s average of 14.4x and significantly below the Asian electric utilities industry average of 17.1x. This indicates that the market may be underpricing its earnings potential. However, when compared to direct peers, Kyushu Electric appears somewhat more expensive than the peer average of 4.3x. Regression analysis also estimates a fair P/E ratio for Kyushu Electric at 8.5x, emphasizing that current market pricing remains conservative relative to what could be justified by fundamentals.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9508/kyushu-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kyushu Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 5.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain.

The recent Sanofi transfer brings some immediate revenue opportunity through milestone payments, but it does not remove the near-term dependency on external partners delivering regulatory and commercial successes. Short-term momentum could hinge on the pace and consistency of these milestone flows, while the main risk remains a slowdown or deferral of such payments that would challenge Novavax’s cash flow and earnings projections.\n</p> <p> One recent development relevant to this pivot is the expanded collaboration with Sanofi to use Matrix-M in their pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, underscoring Novavax’s intent to monetize its platform beyond COVID-19. These partnership agreements could become key revenue levers, but dependable cash generation still relies heavily on timely regulatory and commercial achievements by both Novavax and its larger partners.\n</p> <p> However, in contrast to the promise of partnership-driven revenue, investors should also remain mindful that if partner milestones underperform or arrive late, the impact on liquidity and growth could be...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-nvax/novavax/peugv6f6-confidence-in-licensing-shift-and-partnerships-will-drive-opportunities-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Novavax (it's free!)</a></p><p>Novavax's outlook suggests revenues of $348.5 million and earnings of $55.9 million by 2028.

That means that even when the share price was below the current price of AU$1.95, an insider wanted to cash in some shares.  We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Alan Steele's holding.    </p> <p> Alan Steele divested 2.49m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of AU$1.44.

Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> An insider hasn't  bought Mayfield Group Holdings stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.     Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying.    On the plus side, Mayfield Group Holdings makes money, and is growing profits.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Mayfield Group Holdings.    You'd be interested to know, that we found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/capital-goods/asx-myg/mayfield-group-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Mayfield Group Holdings</strong></a> and we suggest you have a look.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of interesting companies.</a> </p><p><em>For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Capital Power (TSX:CPX) has posted eye-catching headline numbers, with earnings rising at an average annual rate of 33.9% over the past five years, despite a slip into negative earnings growth in the most recent period. Net profit margin dropped to 11.7% from last year’s 13.7%, and the bottom line was boosted by a one-off CA$290.0 million gain. Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow at 4.1% per year, trailing the Canadian market’s 5%, while earnings are expected to accelerate by 21.3% per year, pacing well ahead of the sector. Investors are weighing this strong growth outlook against a premium 27x P/E ratio as well as notable risks around financial quality, share dilution, and dividend sustainability.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Capital Power.</a> <p>Next up, we’ll see how the headline figures fit alongside the current narratives.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Watts Water Technologies (WTS) shares have pulled back about 2% over the past month, even as the company’s returns this year remain strong.

This sets the stage for a closer look at what’s driving analyst conviction about Watts’ future earnings and market opportunity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The accelerating rollout and success of Nexa, Watts' intelligent water management platform, positions the company to capture the growing demand for advanced, data-driven water conservation, efficiency, and regulatory compliance solutions.

Watts trades at 29.2x earnings, noticeably higher than both the industry average of 24.6x and the peer average of 28.7x. The fair ratio, which could be the level the market moves toward, is just 21.1x. This premium signals the market expects outsized growth or rewards quality.

Revenue is forecast to decline by 4.7% per year over the next three years, while EPS is expected to grow at a rate of 5.53% annually.

This perspective is underlined by concerns over rising capital requirements and the pace of Equinor’s renewables expansion.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that while Equinor’s low multiple offers immediate value, it may also reflect caution about the sustainability of high dividends as legacy oil and gas fields mature.</li> <li>The consensus also points out that persistent optimism assumes offshore wind and renewables will offset margin pressures.

Ongoing profit growth and new long-term gas contracts could add upside.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus highlights that the fair value premium is only meaningful if projected margin improvements and cash flows from new projects materialize amid regulatory and price risks.</li> <li>This wide discount, combined with moderate analyst price targets near current levels, shows how the market is balancing potential upside with caution about decarbonization and energy transition headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Equinor on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different interpretation of the data?

The latest guidance for Q4, featuring substantially reduced EBITDA estimates and a clear acknowledgment of ongoing softness in demand, has put the spotlight on Olin’s ability to deliver tangible margin improvements, while the main short-term catalyst remains successful execution on cost reduction, and the biggest risk continues to be a prolonged global oversupply and weak pricing environment in chlor-alkali and vinyls. The recent update does not materially change these fundamental drivers, but elevates scrutiny of operational execution through what management warns is seasonally the weakest quarter.</p> <p>Among the latest company actions, Olin announced the repurchase of 500,000 shares for US$10.1 million during the third quarter, finalizing just over 21% of the buyback program launched in mid-2022. This ongoing share repurchase effort is important as it signals confidence in capital return even as near-term earnings headwinds remain a concern for investors tracking progress on both catalysts and risks.</p> <p>Yet unlike the market’s initial focus on low EDC prices, investors should also be aware of the risks posed by ongoing high inventories and weak demand in the Winchester ammunition segment...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-oln/olin/9ns8vr59-analyst-commentary-reflects-cautious-optimism-as-olin-faces-mixed-signals-and-modest-valuation-gains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Olin (it's free!)</a></p><p>Olin's outlook anticipates $7.4 billion in revenue and $375.3 million in earnings by 2028.

The recent progress update showing 63% completion and on-budget construction is a big step, as it keeps key short-term catalysts, like first gold production in January 2026 and successful plant commissioning, firmly in play. This milestone reduces uncertainty around delays and cost overruns, which had been front-of-mind risks. However, significant insider selling and a price-to-book ratio well above sector averages leave open questions about valuation and management confidence. While the strong pace of progress likely tempers some immediate risks, funding, gold price sensitivity and execution remain central issues worth tracking as Fenix moves closer to production.</p> Yet, the pace of insider selling raises questions investors should not overlook.\n\nRio2's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d60db42f-7272-451b-a708-599b0564ba25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Nine members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate Rio2's fair value from US$1,000 to US$10,000.

Net profit margins surged to 44.3% this year, up from 31.4% last year. However, this jump was influenced by a $568.3 million one-off gain, which plays a key role in the comparison.

While limited new apartment supply and strong demand trends help stabilize revenue, Essex’s heavy reliance on California and Seattle assets means growth will remain exposed to local regulation and potential economic downturns.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts note ongoing demographic support for occupancy and rents; however, recent slow rent growth in Southern California—which accounts for 40% of Essex’s portfolio—signals risks to sustained profitability.</li> <li>It is notable that, despite the current high margin, analysts anticipate further pressure as Essex phases out higher-yielding investments and encounters more competition along with stricter regulation in its key urban markets.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To see how analysts weigh both upside and risk as margins adjust, check the balanced narrative in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Essex Property Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Trails Broader Market</h2> <ul> <li>Revenue is projected to grow at just 2.9% annually over the next three years, well below the expected 10.3% per year for the US market. Earnings are forecast to decline by -22.4% per year during the same period.</li> <li>The consensus narrative underscores that, although Essex’s strategy favors capital allocation to stabilized, high-occupancy apartments in tech-centric areas, the lack of diversification continues to be a risk—recent underperformance in key geographies demonstrates this vulnerability.\n    <ul> <li>Some analysts argue that ongoing softness in Los Angeles and increased exposure to local supply and demand cycles will limit potential growth, particularly as Essex shifts away from higher-margin structured finance and refocuses on core real estate assets.</li> <li>From a consensus perspective, compressed cap rates and strong competition for acquisitions in Northern California, where yields are in the low-to-mid 4% range, could constrain future returns relative to more diversified REIT peers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Remains Supportive Despite Softer Projections</h2> <ul> <li>Essex’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 19x is notably below the peer average of 50.8x and the North American Residential REITs industry average of 24.4x. The current share price of $249.82 is about 28% below the DCF fair value estimate of $347.22.</li> <li>The analysts’ consensus narrative acknowledges that while earnings are expected to decline and future profit margins are set to compress, valuation metrics and a current price about 16% below their $291.11 price target provide support for a positive longer-term case for income and value-focused investors.\n    <ul> <li>The ongoing discount to fair value offers a cushion for investors focused on yield and capital protection, while also recognizing potential regulatory and economic volatility.</li> <li>Consensus further highlights that income-oriented investors remain attracted to Essex’s dividend and track record, despite concerns about near-term earnings declines and compressed margins compared to industry averages.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Essex Property Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you interpret the data another way?

This approach helps investors understand what the business is worth based on its ability to generate cash over time.</p> <p>For Conagra Brands, the DCF model starts with a current Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $1.17 Billion. Analyst estimates project annual FCF growth over the next several years, with forecasts reaching $1.29 Billion by 2029. While analyst predictions are provided for the first five years, projections beyond that period are extrapolated by Simply Wall St to give a full ten-year outlook on future cash generation.</p> <p>After discounting these future cash flows to reflect their value in today's terms, the estimated intrinsic value for Conagra Brands stock stands at $76.38 per share. This calculation suggests the market is pricing the company at a steep discount. According to the DCF model, the stock is currently trading 77.2% below its fair value.</p> <p>Given these projections, the DCF model indicates that Conagra Brands may be significantly undervalued compared to its estimated future earnings power.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Conagra Brands is undervalued by 77.2%.

It's especially useful when a company generates steady profits and you want a quick sense of how it stacks up to similar businesses.</p> <p>What counts as a fair PE ratio can depend on several factors. Higher growth prospects usually justify a higher multiple, while greater risks or slower expected growth push that “normal” multiple lower. Comparing a company’s PE to its sector and direct peers can give you perspective, but it does not tell the full story about its unique outlook and characteristics.</p> <p>Currently, Conagra Brands trades at a PE ratio of 9.8x. For context, the average PE ratio among its food industry peers is 15.5x, and the wider industry average stands at 17.9x. At first glance, this price looks attractively low. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio, which factors in growth, profit margin, risk profile, and market cap, suggests a fair value PE ratio for Conagra of 17.0x. Unlike basic comparisons, this Fair Ratio provides a more accurate picture by tailoring the benchmark to the company’s specific circumstances.</p> <p>In simple terms, Conagra’s current PE is well below both its peer group and its Fair Ratio, indicating the stock is undervalued based on its earnings potential and fundamental outlook.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-cag/conagra-brands/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CAG PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/04039ab2-17ae-4d3e-9bdc-01df3f150b8c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CAG PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1408 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Conagra Brands Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personal story or perspective about a company that connects the dots between the business’s strategy, future financial forecasts, and what you believe its shares should be worth.</p> <p>Unlike traditional valuation tools, Narratives empower investors to make sense of the numbers by tying them to real-world trends, assumptions about revenue, margins, and risk, and your expectations for the company’s future. Each Narrative links your view of Conagra Brands’ path ahead to an explicit financial forecast, culminating in a calculated fair value tailored to your outlook.</p> <p>Narratives are easy to use and fully accessible via Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share, compare, and refine their investment stories. They provide actionable confidence by letting you see at a glance if the market price is below or above your own fair value, helping you decide when a stock is truly a buy or a sell in your playbook.</p> <p>As news breaks or earnings are released, Narratives update dynamically, so your story and valuation always reflect the latest facts. For example, one investor might believe that Conagra’s strong brands and improved supply chain will drive stable margins and assign a fair value near $26 per share, while another could focus on industry headwinds and see fair value closer to $18.
