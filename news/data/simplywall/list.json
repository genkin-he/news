Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development. This initiative is closely linked to iFAST’s recurring revenue ambitions and operational leverage, as onboarding moves toward completion. Efficient execution here could support ongoing profit and margin improvements, but the risk lies in managing rising expenses without delay.\n</p> <p> However, it’s important to remember that not all drivers of growth are within management control, particularly if...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/sg/diversified-financials/sgx-aiy/ifast-shares/jg59binl-digital-banking-and-ai-integration-will-expand-global-reach-kacr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on iFAST (it's free!)</a></p><p>iFAST's narrative projects SGD716.4 million revenue and SGD163.0 million earnings by 2028.

percentage points due to successful refinancing, and ongoing IT-driven cost reductions (€800,000 saved per quarter) are aiming to boost Axactor's free cash flow and net profitability.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, disciplined cost management and the rollout of digital collection platforms are set to drive margin gains, with net margins forecast to climb from -49.6% to 21.9% over the next three years.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that new third-party collection contracts, especially in Norway, could accelerate revenue and margin growth in 2026–2027 if cost savings materialize as planned.</li> <li>What is surprising is that despite flat revenue growth in certain regions and recent margin pressure from onboarding costs, consensus expects efficiency initiatives and a larger addressable market to materially lift profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See where analysts agree and disagree on whether Axactor’s efficiency push is enough to drive

Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Market Share Upside Tied to NPL Investments</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor is strategically investing in new non-performing loan (NPL) portfolios, aiming to capture a bigger share of Europe’s growing consumer debt market and capitalize on a strong NPL disposal pipeline.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that management’s pivot toward acquiring new NPLs, combined with proprietary analytics and IT upgrades, positions Axactor for improved collection performance and higher future revenues.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus view emphasizes the large-scale third-party collection contracts and recently extended debt maturities into 2027–2028 as supporting longer-term growth ambitions.</li> <li>Bears argue that if flat year-over-year gross revenues (down 9% overall, down 1% excluding the Spain sale) persist due to a more “normalized” market, hoped-for NPL-related gains could fall short.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Faces Profitability Hurdles</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor’s Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x is lower than both its peer average (3x) and the broader Consumer Finance industry (1.7x), but the current share price (NOK7.1) still trades above DCF fair value (NOK4.24) and below the analyst target (NOK10.00), revealing a tension between quantitative cheapness and earnings uncertainty.</li> <li>Consensus narrative calls out that to justify the analyst target price, Axactor needs to grow annual revenue to €317.5 million and convert losses of €-67.6 million to €69.5 million in profit within four years, a significant turnaround embedded into current forecasts.\n    <ul> <li>This expectation leans on higher margins, steady share count, and a future PE ratio of 5.1x, meaning risk remains if margin expansion or revenue targets are missed against industry headwinds and competition.</li> <li>Investors are encouraged to cross-check these optimistic forecasts against their own outlook, as the stock currently trades in the limbo between promising multiples and persistent losses.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of

Its current share price of 2772.00 is well below its DCF fair value estimate of 5237.79.</li> <li>Building on the prevailing market view, this discount highlights an under-the-radar opportunity for investors who focus on value rather than chasing momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls argue that defensive infrastructure names like Yokogawa Bridge often attract a premium, so its current valuation could appeal to buyers seeking safety and capital preservation.</li> <li>On the other hand, some caution that the lack of a strong price premium may reflect low near-term excitement, leaving prospective investors to balance stability against potential for fast gains.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Sustainability Remains a Key Watchpoint</h2> <ul> <li>The primary risk flagged is around the sustainability of Yokogawa Bridge’s dividend, which moderates enthusiasm given the company’s otherwise steady performance trends.</li> <li>In line with the prevailing market view, this risk echoes a broader pattern seen in the infrastructure sector where headline profits are solid but payout ratios or future distributions require close monitoring.\n    <ul> <li>Loyal income-focused investors are attracted by the company’s stable record, yet persistent questions on dividend security could limit share price upside if not addressed.</li> <li>Ongoing improvements in profit margins may help mitigate this risk, but a clear dividend commitment will remain central for shareholder confidence going forward.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Nifco (TSE:7988) wrapped up its latest share buyback plan on October 30, 2025, after acquiring just over 1.19 million shares, which is about 1.3% of its outstanding stock during the program.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Nifco.</a></p> <p>Nifco wrapped up its share buyback program just as momentum has been building in the stock. The company saw a 19.8% share price return over the last 90 days and a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 30%. This solid run, helped by management’s recent move, suggests investors are viewing the company more favorably and could be reassessing its longer-term potential in the auto parts sector.</p> <p>If you want to see what other auto stocks are catching investors’ attention, now’s a perfect time to explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_auto_manufacturers_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/426622/auto-manufacturers/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With shares up this year and buybacks complete, does Nifco still trade at a discount to its intrinsic worth, or is the recent optimism already reflected in the stock price, leaving little room for further upside?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nifco currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.4x, noticeably cheaper than peers and industry averages. With a last close price of ¥4,567, the market is valuing its earnings at a significant discount to both the broader market and its sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay today for a yen of current earnings. For established auto parts companies like Nifco, the P/E offers a clear lens into market expectations for future profit growth or risk.</p> <p>Nifco’s low P/E suggests investors may be underappreciating its recent profit surge. While the stock sits well below the peer average of 16.4x and the Japanese auto components industry average of 11.6x, its trailing earnings growth has been impressive. However, forecasts point to less optimistic profit trends in coming years. This could be tempering the multiple assigned by the market.</p> <p>It is helpful to compare this 9.4x P/E not only to competitors, but also to what analysts deem a “fair” multiple for Nifco. The estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio is 8.4x, indicating the stock looks a bit expensive on this metric. The market’s enthusiasm may be pushing it closer to, or slightly above, its justified level based on recent performance and expected outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nifco</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower net income growth and a smaller discount to analyst price targets could weigh on sentiment if profitability does not meet expectations.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nifco narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Says \"Undervalued\"</h2> <p>Looking at Nifco through the lens of our DCF model tells a different story.

Over the past five years, earnings have grown at a healthy 19.8% per year, though most recent annual earnings growth eased to 3.9%. Investors will find it notable that the shares are priced attractively, with a PE ratio of 8.6x, which is well below both the sector average and the company is trading under its estimated fair value at NOK 188.76. Looking ahead, forecasts point to earnings growth of 6.7% per year and revenue growth of 0.7% per year.

While the year-to-date share price return is a positive 4%, this latest rally suggests that investor optimism could be building as sentiment shifts around cybersecurity growth stories like Netskope.</p> <p>If today’s momentum has you curious about what else could be on the move, it’s the perfect chance to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_tech_and_ai_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/215171/high-growth-tech-and-ai-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With a share price rally underway and double-digit annual revenue growth, the main question becomes whether Netskope’s current valuation reflects untapped potential or if the market has already priced in the company’s future gains.

At a last close of $23.41, this premium valuation raises the question of whether investors are overestimating Netskope's potential compared to rivals.</p> <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current sales. It is often used for high-growth tech companies that may not yet be profitable. For expanding firms like Netskope, a higher multiple can reflect future growth expectations or strong market positioning. However, it may also indicate frothy sentiment if financial fundamentals lag behind those hopes.</p> <p>Specifically, Netskope's 14.5x P/S is almost double the peer group average of 7.5x and almost triple the US Software industry average of 5.4x. This sharp divergence suggests the market is either expecting superior growth or is currently overvaluing the company relative to peers, especially given that Netskope is not yet profitable.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 14.5x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, ongoing lack of profitability and a high valuation compared to peers could spark a turnaround if revenue growth slows or investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Netskope narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model Puts Valuation Into Question</h2> <p>Taking a different perspective with our SWS DCF model, Netskope appears even more stretched on valuation.

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat. While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant. This EUR 60 million investment is central to Metsä Board’s strategy of boosting product quality and supporting its transition to fossil-free production, underscoring the company’s push for cost efficiency and alignment with long-term sustainability trends that underpin revenue recovery prospects.\n</p> <p> But with European demand still sluggish and restructuring ongoing, investors should be mindful that even well-executed upgrades cannot fully offset...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fi/materials/hel-metsb/metsa-board-oyj-shares/pd0x5y6d-cost-efficiency-and-fiber-packaging-will-drive-long-term-success-dfbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Metsä Board Oyj (it's free!)</a></p><p>Metsä Board Oyj’s narrative projects €2.1 billion revenue and €124.4 million earnings by 2028.

You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The market sits below the narrative’s consensus, with expectations shaped by forecasts of revenue growth, profit margins, and disciplined execution in asset management.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Accelerating ETF product development and distribution, including new launches in both equity and fixed income, is opening access to new client segments such as RIAs and non-traditional channels.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if PulteGroup is currently undervalued or if you’ve missed your shot? You’re not alone, as many investors are buzzing about its long-term potential.</li> <li>The stock price has moved around lately, with a 9.8% gain year-to-date and significant gains over three years. However, a recent dip of 11.2% over the past month suggests some caution may be setting in.</li> <li>Big headlines have focused on the broader housing market’s swing in demand and builder optimism, which have influenced investor sentiment on homebuilders like PulteGroup. With industry fundamentals evolving and mortgage rates causing movement, the news has kept the spotlight on this sector’s resilience and risks.</li> <li>PulteGroup currently scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> on our most important valuation checks, showing plenty of signs of potential value. We’ll examine what that really means using several valuation methods and, by the end, present an even better way to assess value that many people miss.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_industry_underperformer\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out why PulteGroup's -8.5% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3>Approach 1: PulteGroup Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's true value by forecasting its future cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to today's dollars. This process helps investors judge what a business is really worth, not just what the market says.</p> <p>For PulteGroup, the DCF model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company's Free Cash Flow for the last twelve months came in at $1.56 billion. Over the next decade, analyst estimates and projections show some growth ahead, with Free Cash Flows expected to reach around $2.01 billion in 2027. Simply Wall St extends these forecasts out to 2035, using consensus and extrapolated figures to build a fuller long-term picture.</p> <p>Based on this model, the intrinsic fair value for PulteGroup is calculated at $154.61 per share. This suggests the shares are 23.5% undervalued relative to the current market price, which indicates upside potential for new and existing investors. The model points to a margin of safety, and PulteGroup’s cash generation outlook supports a compelling value case at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PulteGroup is undervalued by 23.5%.

When companies generate steady profits, the PE ratio offers a direct look at how the market values their underlying earnings power.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio typically depends on both growth expectations and perceived risk. Companies with stronger growth prospects, more stable earnings, or lower risk tend to justify higher PE ratios. Businesses facing uncertainty or slower growth are often priced lower on this metric.</p> <p>PulteGroup’s current PE ratio stands at 8.8x, which is meaningfully lower than the Consumer Durables industry average of 10.6x and also below the average for similar peers at 14.1x. On the surface, this could signal that the stock is undervalued compared to the broader sector.</p> <p>To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for PulteGroup at 15.0x. This metric aims to capture more nuance than a simple peer or industry comparison by factoring in the company’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry dynamics, market cap, and unique risk profile. The Fair Ratio helps avoid common pitfalls of benchmarking and puts all the fundamental information into a context tailored for PulteGroup.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 15.0x to the actual PE of 8.8x highlights a significant undervaluation in the shares. It suggests the company is trading at a hefty discount even after considering all relevant risks and growth opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1386 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PulteGroup Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives, an innovative, story-driven approach that connects your perspective on a company, like PulteGroup, directly to its future financial forecasts and your estimated fair value.</p> <p>A Narrative is simply your story for a stock, combining your expectations for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins with your own reasoning and assumptions about the business. Instead of relying solely on formulas, Narratives let you personalize valuation by linking what you believe about PulteGroup’s strategy or market opportunity to concrete financial scenarios.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's Community page, millions of investors are already using Narratives as an easy and intuitive tool to guide buy or sell decisions. Narratives clearly lay out your fair value, compare it to the current price, and give immediate feedback as to whether you see the stock as undervalued, overvalued, or fairly priced.</p> <p>Importantly, Narratives are dynamic. As soon as news or new earnings arrive, your Narrative updates so your conclusions always reflect the latest information. For example, some investors use a Narrative that emphasizes sustained growth from Sunbelt migration and active adult communities, resulting in a bullish fair value as high as $163.00. Others highlight margin pressure and affordability challenges, leading to a much lower fair value near $98.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PulteGroup? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

While the recent foundry orders showcase solid customer traction and reinforce product differentiation, they do not materially alter the biggest short-term catalyst, broad-based order momentum in advanced packaging, nor do they meaningfully reduce Veeco’s largest risk of customer and geographic concentration.\n</p> <p> The October 2025 announcement of multiple new orders for WaferStorm, WaferEtch, and AP300 systems is the most relevant recent development, as these platforms underpin Veeco’s push into high-growth advanced packaging and next-generation device manufacturing. This aligns closely with the catalyst surrounding demand strength in high-performance computing and silicon photonics, marking continued validation of Veeco’s core technology in critical markets.\n</p> <p> But despite these positive signals, investors should keep in mind the continued risk if future orders remain concentrated in just a few customers or regions...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-veco/veeco-instruments/ntgzg4es-macroeconomic-uncertainty-will-compress-semiconductor-industry-margins-vi0n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Veeco Instruments (it's free!)</a></p><p>Veeco Instruments' outlook anticipates $782.0 million in revenue and $66.0 million in earnings by 2028.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple.
