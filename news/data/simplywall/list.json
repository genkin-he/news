These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p><p> To get a sense of who is truly in control of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PRUDENT</a>), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business.  And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 58% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> As market cap fell to ₹106b last week, insiders would have faced the highest losses than any other shareholder groups of the company.    </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudent Advisory Services. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Prudent Advisory Services </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761972942585\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Ownership Breakdown November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudent Advisory Services?</h2><p> Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. </p> <p> Prudent Advisory Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudent Advisory Services' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761972943724\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Prudent Advisory Services is not owned by hedge funds.      From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Sanjay Shah (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 55% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.      Additionally, the company's CEO Shirish Patel directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.   </p><p> While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Prudent Advisory Services</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. </p><p> Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. </p> <p> Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company.   Given it has a market cap of ₹106b, that means insiders have a whopping ₹61b worth of shares in their own names.  It is good to see this level of investment. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check here to see if those insiders have been selling any of their shares. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.   While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. </p> <h2>Private Company Ownership</h2><p> Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 6.7%, of the company's shares.   It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. </p> <p> I always like to check for a <strong>history of revenue growth</strong>.

The latest set of results, showing a small net loss in the most recent quarter but a dramatic surge in net income over the nine months, doesn’t fundamentally change this long-term story. The regular and special dividends, combined with a debt-free balance sheet, still signal strong capital management. However, the pullback in share repurchases this quarter and the market’s recent price drop may point to some shifting priorities or softer near-term demand for data licensing. While the headline profit swing and continued capital return matter, they don’t seem material enough to offset ongoing risks like volatility in seismic data sales linked to energy sector uncertainty.\n<br/><br/> Conversely, short-term swings in licensing revenues can change the outlook quickly for shareholders.\n</p> Despite retreating, Pulse Seismic's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how much</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/32be1ff6-af93-4e90-ab28-50d059107da5/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirteen individual fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from C$1.89 to a very large C$509,435.53 per share.

This highlights a clear valuation discount for investors at the current share price of $36.24.</li> <li>The current comparison to sector norms supports the idea that, even with short-term profit boosts, the market awaits more consistent evidence of durable earnings before awarding a valuation closer to industry multiples.\n    <ul> <li>While discounted pricing can appear attractive, it underscores how investors tend to approach such valuations carefully when underlying profit drivers rely on non-recurring events.</li> <li>This context positions the present multiple as a potential opportunity or simply a reflection of ongoing skepticism related to earnings quality.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for.   Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.   Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So on that note, <strong>Genuit Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/capital-goods/lse-gen/genuit-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LON:GEN</a>) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Genuit Group: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.091 = UK£78m ÷ (UK£993m - UK£129m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Genuit Group has an ROCE of 9.1%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Building industry average of 14%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/capital-goods/lse-gen/genuit-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Genuit Group </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/capital-goods/lse-gen/genuit-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/3379847-roce-1-dark-2/1761987168726\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LSE:GEN Return on Capital Employed November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Genuit Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.  If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/capital-goods/lse-gen/genuit-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free analyst report for Genuit Group </a>. </p><h2> What Does the ROCE Trend For Genuit Group Tell Us? </h2><p> We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment.   The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 9.1%.  Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 28% more capital is being employed now too.  The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.   </p><h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Genuit Group has.        Since the total return from the stock has been almost flat over the last  five years, there might be an opportunity here if the valuation looks good.   With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.    </p><p> If you want to continue researching Genuit Group, you might be interested to know about the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/capital-goods/lse-gen/genuit-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign</strong> </a>that our analysis has discovered.    </p><p> If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

Heightened demand for environmental monitoring, security, and smart infrastructure, driven by government and private investment in sustainability and regulatory compliance, is expanding Norbit's addressable market.

This move streamlines OPKO’s diagnostics operations, reduces complexity, and is aligned with its aim to return the segment to profitability, a critical component for supporting future growth ambitions driven by milestone payments and broader partnerships.</p> <p>However, despite a renewed operational focus, investors should be aware that ongoing losses and dependence on external deals remain a concern if...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nasdaq-opk/opko-health/3ahrj9e4-core-testing-and-fda-approvals-will-strengthen-diagnostics-vw4j\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on OPKO Health (it's free!)</a></p><p>OPKO Health's outlook projects $754.1 million in revenue and $40.6 million in earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li> Wondering if Avidity Biosciences is a hidden gem or just riding a wave? You are not alone, as many investors are asking if the stock's price truly reflects its underlying value.\n  </li> <li> The share price has skyrocketed lately, jumping 42.1% in just the past week and up an impressive 124.0% year-to-date, with a 3-year gain of 415.1%.\n  </li> <li> Avidity Biosciences has caught attention after securing fresh FDA clearance to expand its clinical pipeline for RNA-targeted therapies, sparking optimism about its long-term growth. Investors are also buzzing about recent collaborations the company announced with larger biotech firms, further boosting market sentiment.\n  </li> <li> Despite all the excitement, Avidity scores just <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rna/avidity-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a> on our valuation checks. This means it is not currently undervalued by any of our standard measures. Let's dig into the numbers with classic valuation tools, but stay tuned as we will also explore a smarter way to think about fair value by the end of this article.\n  </li> </ul> <p>Avidity Biosciences scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

This approach offers insight into whether the market price reflects the company's ability to generate cash over time.\n</p> <p> For Avidity Biosciences, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is negative at $-496.6 million. Analyst estimates extend up to 2029, indicating cash flows will remain negative until that point, with a swing into positive territory of $127.3 million projected for 2029. Beyond these analyst forecasts, longer-term projections are extrapolated, reaching $375.9 million in 2035. All values are reported in US dollars.\n</p> <p> Simply Wall St’s two-stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model calculates Avidity’s intrinsic value at $34.21 per share. However, the current share price is 104.2% above this estimated fair value, suggesting the stock is significantly overvalued according to this model.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Avidity Biosciences may be overvalued by 104.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 832 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rna/avidity-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RNA Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fbb41430-0eb6-42b4-9685-8042ba2de9ea/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RNA Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rna/avidity-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Avidity Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Avidity Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p> The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is a widely used valuation metric, especially for biotechnology and early-stage companies where profits may not yet be consistent or positive. This ratio compares a company’s market value to its net asset value, making it a handy reference for valuing assets in industries where earnings are volatile or negative.\n</p> <p> Growth expectations and risk play a major role in what is considered a “normal” or “fair” P/B multiple. Higher growth prospects or lower risk profiles typically justify a higher ratio, while slower growth or greater risks should result in a lower one. For context, Avidity Biosciences currently trades at a P/B ratio of 8.41x. The average among peers sits at 7.70x, while the broader biotechs industry average is 2.53x.\n</p> <p> Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio takes things a step further than typical peer or industry comparisons. It estimates what a reasonable P/B multiple should be for Avidity, based on a fuller picture including growth potential, risk factors, profit margins, market capitalization, and where the company sits within its industry. This proprietary metric aims to deliver a more tailored value benchmark for each company and capture subtle nuances the broader averages can miss.\n</p> <p> Comparing Avidity Biosciences’ actual P/B ratio to the Fair Ratio provides a clearer sense of relative value. In this case, the Fair Ratio is not available. While Avidity’s P/B is above both peers and the industry, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about true value without that sharper lens.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rna/avidity-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:RNA PB Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fbb41430-0eb6-42b4-9685-8042ba2de9ea/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:RNA PB Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Avidity Biosciences Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a clear, personalized story that you create to explain your view of a company’s future, linking your beliefs about its business potential to estimates of revenue, earnings, and ultimately its fair value.\n</p> <p> Narratives connect a company’s unique journey, such as breakthroughs, risks, or partnerships, to actual financial forecasts and a valuation you can stand behind. They make investing more approachable by combining facts with your interpretation, and are offered as an easy-to-use tool in Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share their views.\n</p> <p> By comparing your Narrative’s fair value with the current market price, you can see exactly when an opportunity to buy or sell may appear. Since Narratives update as new news or results are released, your view always stays relevant. For example, some investors see Avidity Biosciences’ fair value as high as $60 per share based on aggressive revenue growth, while the lowest see it closer to $12 based on risk concerns and slower progress.\n</p> <p> This dynamic approach empowers you to make more informed and confident investment decisions that move beyond just the numbers.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Avidity Biosciences? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rna/avidity-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:RNA Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fbb41430-0eb6-42b4-9685-8042ba2de9ea/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:RNA Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The recent plan to introduce eight new SUVs in India marks a clear response to this challenge and signals a willingness to invest heavily in future product cycles. While this could reinforce Suzuki’s position and help recapture market share, it also introduces risk, especially as it could mean higher expenses and execution pressures right as rivals ramp up their offerings. The fresh product push might shift short term catalysts, putting a sharper focus on sales momentum and cost control in India, rather than just earnings growth from efficiency. However, it does not immediately resolve fundamental concerns around the board’s inexperience, still low return on equity, and the pace of expected profit growth, issues market participants have been cautious about before this announcement. If anything, investors now have to weigh not just traditional financial markers but also Suzuki’s ability to deliver on this substantial India bet.</p> But, while this expansion is ambitious, investors should also keep Suzuki's leadership challenges in mind.\n\nSuzuki Motor's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 41%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7269/suzuki-motor-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7269/suzuki-motor-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:7269 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9db63672-73bf-46ce-a32a-1105daf75ccb/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:7269 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Simply Wall St Community members have shared two distinct fair value estimates for Suzuki, ranging from ¥1,634,206 to ¥2,454,375.
