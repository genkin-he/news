            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if Nu Holdings is a hidden gem or just another growth story? If you’re curious about whether now is the right time to buy in, you’re not alone.</li> <li>The stock has climbed 51.6% year-to-date and is up 6.1% over the past month, signaling renewed excitement and a possible shift in how investors see its future potential and risks.</li> <li>Recent headlines have spotlighted Nu’s strategic expansion across new Latin American markets and ongoing product launches. This has sparked optimism about its ability to deepen its customer base even as competition intensifies. These developments are fueling speculation that Nu could keep outpacing rivals and capture fresh growth opportunities.</li> <li>Looking at the numbers, Nu Holdings currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a> on our valuation checks for being undervalued, which might surprise some after its run-up. Next, we’ll dig into what this score means, compare common approaches to analyzing valuation, and introduce a smarter way to evaluate whether the stock truly offers value at today’s price.</li> </ul> <p>Nu Holdings scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

Unlike models that focus only on cash flows, this approach centers on the company’s ability to generate “excess” profits from its equity base.</p> <p>For Nu Holdings, the data tells a clear story. The company’s average return on equity is an impressive 29.42%, while its stable book value is estimated at $3.04 per share by six analysts. The stable earnings per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity from nine analysts, stands at $0.90. The cost of equity is $0.36 per share, so the excess return currently generated is $0.53 per share.</p> <p>While strong returns on capital may be a positive sign, the model estimates an intrinsic value that is much lower than today’s price. The Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings is trading at a 76.9% premium to its fair value, which may indicate that the stock is significantly overvalued at present.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings may be overvalued by 76.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 834 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Nu Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Nu Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often viewed as one of the best ways to quickly assess value. The PE multiple captures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings and is especially useful when profits are stable and growing. Higher growth prospects and lower risks typically justify a higher \"normal\" PE ratio. More volatile earnings or higher uncertainties mean investors may expect a lower multiple.</p> <p>Nu Holdings currently trades at a PE ratio of 33.85x. For context, the Banks industry average PE is 11.16x, and its peer group averages 11.48x, suggesting Nu is commanding a significant premium to both benchmarks. This premium usually reflects higher anticipated growth, stronger profitability, or lower perceived risk.</p> <p>Rather than relying solely on these market benchmarks, Simply Wall St introduces the concept of a Fair Ratio, a PE multiple tailored to Nu Holdings' unique profile, including factors like forecast earnings growth, profit margins, industry dynamics, market capitalization, and risk. This approach offers a more individualized, thorough comparison than simple peer or industry averages.</p> <p>Nu Holdings’ Fair Ratio is calculated at 22.69x, meaning the current PE of 33.85x is noticeably higher. This sizeable gap suggests the market is pricing in an ambitious growth scenario that may not be fully supported by the fundamentals as they stand today.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Nu Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, personalized investment story that connects your view of Nu Holdings' future to a concrete forecast of its revenue, profits, and margins. This turns your perspective into an estimate of fair value, not just a gut feeling.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's platform, Narratives are an easy-to-use tool found on the Community page, enabling millions of investors to link real company stories to live financial forecasts and fair value estimates. Narratives allow you to confidently decide when to buy or sell by comparing your assumed fair value (based on your expectations) to the current market price, so you are always investing within your framework.</p> <p>What makes this tool powerful is that Narratives update dynamically as news or earnings releases come in, ensuring your valuation stays current with fresh data. For example, one investor may believe Nu can keep growing fast and assigns a high fair value of $20 per share, while another, more cautious, sees risks from increased competition and values it at $14. Both are using the same Narrative system but very different assumptions.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Nu Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company’s net profit margin has improved recently, even though current profitability is affected by non-recurring losses and the share price of ¥685 trades well above an internal fair value estimate of ¥272.1.

This makes the recent margin uptick tricky for bullish investors to celebrate without more evidence.</li> <li>Bulls often focus on the return to profit and margin expansion, but fundamentals suggest that one-off charges remain just as important for a true earnings reset.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Price-to-Sales Lags Sector, but Premium to DCF Fair Value Raises Eyebrows</h2> <ul> <li>Taiho Kogyo trades at 0.2x price-to-sales, lower than the peer average of 0.5x and the broad industry level of 0.4x. This suggests a valuation discount on revenues despite a share price of ¥685 that stands well above the DCF fair value of ¥272.10.</li> <li>Optimists argue the sector-relative discount makes the stock attractive, but\n    <ul> <li>the sizable premium to its own DCF value shows that market sentiment is pricing in a brighter future than fundamentals alone may justify, especially given that past five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3% per year.</li> <li>Peer comparisons favor Taiho Kogyo on a price-to-sales basis. However, the fair value gap reminds value-driven investors to stay alert for a potential reset if future results do not deliver.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Durability in Question as Non-Recurring Losses Continue</h2> <ul> <li>The company’s recent five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3%. Ongoing concerns about dividend sustainability are heightened by non-recurring losses like the recent ¥1.1 billion charge.</li> <li>Supporters point to profit or revenue growth as a reason for optimism, but \n    <ul> <li>reliable dividend payments will likely require not just stable, but sustainably increasing, core profits. This can be challenging when one-off costs remain a drag.</li> <li>Positive sector comparisons may signal some resilience, but fundamental risks around earnings quality and dividend coverage persist until the noise from non-recurring items settles down.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Measured optimism about Taiho Kogyo’s foundation persists, but concrete progress on recurring profitability will matter most for investors watching future payout potential. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-6470/taiho-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Taiho Kogyo.</a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The recent announcement of stronger-than-expected interim results, a raised full-year earnings forecast, and a substantial 36% interim dividend increase signals that key short-term catalysts, like steady end-market demand and effective cost controls, have become more pronounced. These upgrades suggest that profitability momentum is stronger than earlier analysis indicated. Previous risks centered around external threats such as US tariffs and margin pressure from slow revenue growth now appear somewhat diminished, at least in the near term, as the latest results point to solid operational execution and less impact from geopolitical headwinds than first feared. However, valuation remains a concern, with the current share price trading above consensus fair value and a price-to-earnings ratio well above industry averages, which keeps expectations high.</p> But valuation risk could still catch some investors off guard, especially after recent share gains.\n\nSumitomo Electric Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 12%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c5fdbcb3-b869-47ae-bfdc-127d4419245a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Among the Simply Wall St Community, two retail investors estimate fair values for Sumitomo Electric Industries between ¥2,499,690 and ¥4,808,560.

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 283% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 8.7% per annum over the next three years.  Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 20% each year, which paints a poor picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that SK hynix's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From SK hynix's P/E? </h2><p> Despite SK hynix's shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of SK hynix's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> You always need to take note of risks, for example -<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>SK hynix has 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of SK hynix's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

It emphasizes that\n    <ul> <li> the shift away from hardware and legacy contracts is creating persistent topline headwinds, and\n      </li> <li> reliance on acquisitions plus intense competition may limit organic innovation, challenging the durability of recent gains.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>PE Ratio and DCF Valuation Suggest Potential Upside</h2> <ul> <li> At a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x and a share price of $11.4, OneSpan trades far below its DCF fair value of $23.66 and the US Software industry average P/E of 34.1x.\n  </li> <li> In the analysts' consensus view, this deep discount reflects skepticism about sustaining profitability. However, it leaves the door open for re-rating if execution improves or recurring revenues stabilize faster than expected, because\n    <ul> <li> the consensus price target of $18.50 implies roughly 62% upside from here, even as forecasts anticipate a shrinking bottom line, and\n      </li> <li> positive catalysts like cross-selling and new product innovation could drive a reassessment if current headwinds are overcome.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OneSpan on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own interpretation of the latest figures?

This supports cash flow stability and reduces churn risk, even as the company faces top-line pressures.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that the accelerating adoption of generative AI research tools and deeper coverage of digital transformation topics are giving Forrester increased leverage with clients. This has led to improved subscription growth and pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that innovative frameworks like the Total Experience Score have enabled longer contracts and stronger client retention.</li> <li>At the same time, new government contract wins and a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in the sales pipeline point to revenue diversification and potential future stability, despite near-term declines.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Deep Relative Discount Signals Value Disconnect</h2> <ul> <li>Forrester trades at a 0.3x price-to-sales ratio. This is well below the US professional services industry average of 1.3x and the peer average of 5.4x, suggesting the market reflects pessimism about future prospects.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view underscores that while Forrester's DCF fair value is estimated at $14.55 and the analyst price target sits at $12.00, the current share price is just $7.13. This indicates a wide perceived discount. Consensus expects profitability and stability to improve if retention efforts and operational shifts are successful.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap is especially notable given the sector’s 10.3% annual growth benchmark, compared to Forrester’s much lower 0.6% forecasted pace.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests investors must consider whether deep discounts sufficiently compensate for slower growth, given analyst hopes for a turnaround in client engagement and margins.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Operational Pressures Continue to Weigh</h2> <ul> <li>Operating expenses have declined by 6%, primarily due to a 12% reduction in headcount, as Forrester seeks to control losses and protect margins during ongoing sales and client retention challenges.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view draws attention to sustained revenue declines across research, consulting, and events, including an 8% overall revenue drop year-over-year. This highlights substantial pressures on topline stability and raises important questions about the speed of potential recovery.\n    <ul> <li>Critics note that wallet retention and contract value have also slipped, down 1% and 7%, respectively, signaling ongoing client budget tightening driven by macroeconomic factors.</li> <li>Consensus narrative also notes that while the company's cost management efforts have supported margins, these measures could constrain capacity for innovation and limit long-term upside if trends do not reverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The recent share buyback announcement confirms management's willingness to prioritize shareholder value with a substantial repurchase program running until late 2026. While this move sends a positive signal and may provide some short-term support to the share price, the primary catalysts remain upcoming earnings releases and the ability to maintain or accelerate profit growth, especially after the slight deceleration seen in recent years. At the same time, risks like a relatively high Price-To-Earnings ratio compared to the sector, a dividend track record that remains unstable, and frequent board changes continue to warrant close attention. The buyback could help counter some valuation concerns but doesn’t fully resolve underlying business challenges. \n\nOn the other hand, board stability remains an issue that shouldn’t be overlooked by investors.</p> Niterra's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 31%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5334/niterra-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5334/niterra-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5334 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fad2c8c7-9a7b-41a4-9853-068f081d3adf/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5334 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> From the Simply Wall St Community, one retail investor currently pegs Niterra’s fair value at ¥5,680.5, reflecting a single consensus.

This creates both risk if catalysts disappoint and opportunity if operational efficiency or new markets exceed expectations.\n    <ul> <li>The consensus target being so close to the current price suggests the market broadly agrees on fair value based on expected earnings and margin trends, but leaves little near-term upside for new investors at these valuations.</li> <li>This profile spotlights the key tension: strong historical growth and defensive characteristics justify some premium, but further expansion and margin improvement will need to materialize to support continued share appreciation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For a deeper dive into how analysts size up PriceSmart’s future, compare the consensus narrative with performance inside and outside its core markets. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/klyf8sv7-club-rollout-and-chile-expansion-will-unlock-new-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full PriceSmart Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/klyf8sv7-club-rollout-and-chile-expansion-will-unlock-new-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for PriceSmart on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different take on the figures?

The result is a picture of strong forward profit potential and value, tempered by caution over recent operational and payout trends.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-samg/silvercrest-asset-management-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Silvercrest Asset Management Group.</a> <p>We’ll now see how these results line up with the most widely followed narratives about Silvercrest, whether they confirm market confidence or raise new questions for investors.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rp3u68ea-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-and-global-expansion-will-unlock-future-value-u42w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Silvercrest Asset Management Group</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-samg/silvercrest-asset-management-group/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:SAMG Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/47e1d595-da08-470b-8454-a3a6f03bc7ac/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:SAMG Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Fee Compression Limits Revenue Upside</h2> <ul> <li>The most recent quarter saw a decline in year-over-year revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in average annual management fee rate as the asset mix shifted toward lower-fee institutional mandates.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view expects that, while wealthy client and generational wealth trends should boost organic asset inflows, persistent fee compression will threaten margin expansion and slow top-line growth.\n    <ul> <li>Outflows and a shift toward institutional mandates with lower fees are already weighing on the average fee rate, challenging the view that client growth alone will deliver sustainable revenue gains.</li> <li>Consensus notes that diversified offerings and premium advisory services could help offset these headwinds. However, overall margin pressure remains a watchpoint for the next few years.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consistent with this balanced risk and reward picture, analysts anticipate profit margins could eventually recover from 6.6% today to 16.6% in three years, but only if these strategic investments pay off as planned.\n    <ul> <li>With operating leverage yet to materialize, near-term profitability is vulnerable to any setbacks in client growth or continued fee erosion.</li> <li>Expectations for a rebound hinge on the successful execution of expansion and a return to stronger net inflows amid industrywide margin compression.</li> </ul> </li> <li>A 7.3% annual decline in earnings over the past five years, alongside recently negative earnings growth, underscores why consensus is closely watching for signs of a turning point.\n    <ul> <li>This trend calls into question the pace at which new market initiatives and premium service expansion will start translating into bottom-line growth.</li> <li>Consensus sees the recovery path as dependent on both stemming the decline and demonstrating that earnings can actually outpace the industry going forward.</li> </ul> See what could change the story with the full consensus narrative: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rp3u68ea-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-and-global-expansion-will-unlock-future-value-u42w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Silvercrest Asset Management Group Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividends and Share Buybacks Under Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 7.0% annually over the next three years due to active share repurchase programs, aiming to boost earnings per share even as traditional growth levers face challenges.</li> <li>Consensus narrative emphasizes that while aggressive share buybacks and a rising dividend deliver immediate value to shareholders, there is an ongoing risk to dividend sustainability, especially with earnings under pressure and net profit margins having slipped from 7.1% to 6.6%.\n    <ul> <li>Shareholder returns are attractive today, but persistent earnings declines and rising costs could force a re-evaluation of payout ratios if margins do not recover as forecast.</li> <li>With compensation and G&amp;A expenses rising faster than revenue, dividends and buybacks rely on management’s ability to deliver on operating leverage and margin improvement targets despite industry headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Still Offers a Margin of Safety</h2> <ul> <li>Silvercrest trades at $14.14, below both the analyst consensus price target of $23.00 and the DCF fair value of $16.10, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1x that is substantially lower than the US capital markets industry average of 25.6x and the peer average of 63.3x.</li> <li>According to the consensus narrative, this discount provides some cushion for investors who believe in the turnaround.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Financial Partners GroupLtd (TSE:7148) has posted a stellar 40.8% annual earnings growth over the past five years, with net profit margins now at 14%, down from last year's 19%. Revenue is forecast to increase by 17% per year, sharply ahead of the broader Japanese market’s 4.5% projection. Analysts anticipate annual EPS growth of 25.8% moving forward. With a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 9.9x, lower than both the industry average of 12.3x and peers at 11.6x, the stock trades at a discount even as earnings momentum looks set to continue. Investors will note recent margin compression and a negative swing in yearly earnings growth may temper enthusiasm.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/diversified-financials/tse-7148/financial-partners-groupltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Financial Partners GroupLtd.</a> <p>The next section puts today’s headline numbers in context, comparing them to dominant market narratives and spotlighting where consensus holds and where the data tells a different story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

This indicates that, despite top-line growth, costs are eating into profits.</li> <li>Notably, even with this slip in margins, analysts see upside potential from strong revenue forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Revenue is expected to grow by 17% per year, which is well above the market’s 4.5%. Analysts believe that scaling up could help support future profitability despite current headwinds.</li> <li>However, narrowing margins raise fresh questions about operational efficiency and whether anticipated earnings growth of 25.8% annually will flow through as strongly as bulls hope.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Strength Faces Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Dividend sustainability was flagged as a risk. While headline growth is impressive, investors should be alert to signs that payouts may not keep pace with financial performance.</li> <li>Critics highlight that, although the company’s fundamentals are robust on paper:\n    <ul> <li>Warnings around unsound dividend coverage could become more pressing if margin compression continues, especially since net profit margin dropped by 5 percentage points year-over-year.</li> <li>The overall financial position, while not dire, calls for careful monitoring if investors are banking on high and stable dividends as part of the total return.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Discount to Peers and DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The 9.9x Price-to-Earnings ratio is a marked discount to the industry average of 12.3x and to peers at 11.6x. The current 2,140 JPY share price sits well below the DCF fair value estimate of 3,446.40 JPY, suggesting substantial upside if expectations hold true.</li> <li>This gap heavily supports the case that the stock offers relative value:\n    <ul> <li>Despite margin and earnings volatility, projected revenue and EPS growth rates outpace the broader market, which could justify re-rating closer to peer multiples over time.</li> <li>Still, investors must weigh whether the current discount is due to transitory issues, such as margin compression, or is a more persistent sign of underlying risk, especially in light of flagged concerns over financial strength and payout sustainability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To see how these themes connect to shifting market sentiment and community expectations, check the latest consensus on where Financial Partners GroupLtd might be headed. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_consensus_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Financial Partners GroupLtd Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if SkyWest’s share price reflects its true value, or if there’s something the market might be missing? You’re definitely not alone. There is a lot to explore when it comes to what this stock is really worth.</li> <li>Recently, SkyWest’s stock has been relatively stable, with a slight 0.1% gain over the last week but down just 0.6% year-to-date. This follows its significant 472.9% rise over the past three years.</li> <li>Market chatter has picked up amid sector-wide optimism and renewed confidence in regional carriers, partly thanks to expanding travel demand and evolving partnerships within the industry. This context helps explain why SkyWest’s price might be shifting now, even though there have not been major headlines recently.</li> <li>On our valuation scorecard, SkyWest currently stands at <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> for undervaluation checks, making it a standout among its peers.

This approach gives investors a clearer sense of intrinsic value based on the money the business is expected to generate.</p> <p>For SkyWest, the model starts with its latest annual Free Cash Flow of $312.5 million. Analyst projections see this growing steadily, reaching $526 million by 2027. Simply Wall St then extrapolates those analyst figures over a total of ten years, foreseeing Free Cash Flow potentially moving above $1 billion by 2035. All these numbers are calculated in USD and reflect both forecasted results by analysts and further estimates using observed trends.</p> <p>Pulled together and discounted to today’s value, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $257.27 per share. This is a striking 60.9% higher than the current share price, indicating that SkyWest stock may be significantly undervalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests SkyWest is undervalued by 60.9%. Track this in your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>, or discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">834 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows</a>.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SKYW Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a91a2f28-b555-432a-bc36-4bc56bc1779f/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SKYW Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for SkyWest.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: SkyWest Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often the preferred metric for valuing profitable companies like SkyWest, as it directly links a company's share price to its bottom-line earnings. This makes it easy to gauge what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of profit. A higher PE can reflect expectations for robust future growth, while a lower PE might indicate more risk or less confidence in those prospects.</p> <p>Currently, SkyWest trades at a PE ratio of 9.95x. This is just above the industry average for airlines, which stands at 8.75x, and significantly below the peer group average of 23.98x. These comparisons suggest that SkyWest may not be getting the same growth premium as top competitors, even though it remains comfortably profitable.</p> <p>To provide a more tailored benchmark, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for SkyWest. In this case, it is 10.92x. Unlike standard industry or peer averages, the Fair Ratio adjusts for unique factors such as SkyWest’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, size, industry dynamics, and risk profile. This offers a more accurate reflection of what SkyWest's multiple should be in today’s market, giving investors a comprehensive perspective.</p> <p>SkyWest’s actual PE ratio of 9.95x is very close to its Fair Ratio of 10.92x, suggesting the stock is trading at about the level its fundamentals warrant.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:SKYW PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a91a2f28-b555-432a-bc36-4bc56bc1779f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:SKYW PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your SkyWest Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your own story behind a company's numbers, connecting your personal perspective on future revenue, earnings, and margins with an assumed fair value. Instead of relying only on static metrics, Narratives bring together the company’s business story, your expectations, and financial forecasts into one easy-to-use tool, available on Simply Wall St’s Community page and trusted by millions of investors.</p> <p>Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by comparing your own Fair Value to today’s market price.

This highlights a clear valuation discount for investors at the current share price of $36.24.</li> <li>The current comparison to sector norms supports the idea that, even with short-term profit boosts, the market awaits more consistent evidence of durable earnings before awarding a valuation closer to industry multiples.\n    <ul> <li>While discounted pricing can appear attractive, it underscores how investors tend to approach such valuations carefully when underlying profit drivers rely on non-recurring events.</li> <li>This context positions the present multiple as a potential opportunity or simply a reflection of ongoing skepticism related to earnings quality.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The latest results, marked by surging profits and stable wireless revenue guidance, appear to bolster confidence in a near-term earnings catalyst; however, subscriber churn and intense pricing competition remain the biggest immediate risks and the impact of this earnings beat does not materially change that equation.\n</p> <p> One standout development is Verizon's new commercial fiber agreement with Eaton Fiber, which broadens the reach of Fios broadband beyond its traditional footprint. This move is tightly linked to Verizon’s stated catalyst of expanding fixed connectivity and providing new routes for service revenue, yet it comes as ongoing postpaid phone churn continues to pressure the core wireless business.\n</p> <p> Yet investors should also consider, in contrast, how persistent subscriber losses or elevated churn could…\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/telecom/nyse-vz/verizon-communications/oa1a9fwa-vz-wireless-spectrum-deal-and-incoming-ceo-will-drive-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Verizon Communications (it's free!)</a></p><p>Verizon Communications' outlook anticipates $144.5 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in earnings by 2028.
