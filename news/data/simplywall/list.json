The recent US$2.0 billion-plus equity and preferred recapitalization, and the backlash over dilution, now make capital allocation and governance a key near term catalyst and risk, as investors weigh balance sheet repair against potential pressure on per share earnings.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the late February 2026 equity and preferred offerings, totaling roughly US$475 million in common shares and about US$1.58 billion in preferred and depositary shares, matter most here. The proceeds are earmarked for debt repayment and corporate purposes, directly affecting Whirlpool’s capital structure at a time when its dividend coverage, leverage and profitability are already under scrutiny, and when consensus still expects only modest revenue growth and mid single digit margins.</p> <p>Yet, while recapitalization may support financial flexibility, investors should also be aware of the growing tension between dilution risk and Whirlpool’s ability to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Whirlpool (it's free!)</a></p><p>Whirlpool's narrative projects $15.8 billion revenue and $741.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Whirlpool's forecasts yield a $87.67 fair value</a>, a 28% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/67dc9682-e1be-411e-a8eb-0d0aa3a0425f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>The lowest set of analysts sketches a much more cautious path than consensus, arguing that tightening environmental and recycling rules could push Whirlpool’s already thin margins even lower.

This aligns with the key catalyst that recurring SaaS and services can become a larger share of revenue and profit, partly offsetting exposure to slower growth in legacy fuel dispensers and environmental monitoring products.</p> <p>Yet beneath this push into EV charging and AI driven innovation, investors still need to be aware that Vontier remains heavily exposed to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-vnt/vontier/93vwx4j5-digital-payment-and-saas-will-transform-fueling-industry-dm6i\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Vontier (it's free!)</a></p><p>Vontier's narrative projects $3.4 billion revenue and $549.8 million earnings by 2028.

The latest inflation-driven selloff, layered on top of earlier expense concerns, mainly sharpens attention on near term funding costs and credit quality. It does not yet appear to alter the key longer term catalyst from policy changes, but it could increase the perceived risk around margins.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, SLM’s recent US$500,000,000 share repurchase authorization stands out. After the stock’s steep pullback, ongoing buybacks and the existing 2.77% dividend signal that management is continuing to return capital even as analysts reassess expense trends and earnings forecasts. How effectively SLM balances capital return with maintaining a buffer against potential inflation related funding and credit shocks is now central to how investors view the near term risk reward trade off.</p> <p>But there is one inflation related funding risk investors really need to keep in mind...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm/781dxfkl-slm-lower-federal-student-loan-supply-will-boost-private-lending-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on SLM (it's free!)</a></p><p>SLM's narrative projects $2.0 billion revenue and $918.9 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm/781dxfkl-slm-lower-federal-student-loan-supply-will-boost-private-lending-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how SLM's forecasts yield a $31.64 fair value</a>, a 69% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SLM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/24c59d2b-d47b-41c8-b3ae-b808386bc7ce/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SLM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>While the baseline view leans on policy driven loan growth, the most pessimistic analysts were already assuming revenue of about US$1.7 billion and earnings of roughly US$554.0 million, reminding you that opinions can differ sharply and that this inflation shock could push those expectations and the underlying risk balance in very different directions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 2 other fair value estimates on SLM</a> - why the stock might be worth just $31.64!</p><h2>Form Your Own Verdict</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your SLM research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 4 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-slm/slm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free SLM research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate SLM's overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Ready For A Different Approach?</h2><p>Our top stock finds are flying under the radar-for now.

You may want to watch how the company balances deal size, integration risk and balance sheet strength as specific transactions are announced, and how clearly each acquisition ties back to the stated focus on long term shareholder value.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-npo/enpro/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Enpro</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

The company operates in a sector where capital spending, customer rates, and regulatory relationships all matter, and where experience with large scale water systems can be particularly valuable. Rowe’s mix of operational and regulatory background aligns with those day to day demands.</p> <p>His appointment comes at a time when water utilities are often considering larger capital projects, new technology for system reliability, and potential acquisitions.

This has put the insurer’s recent share performance under closer investor scrutiny.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings.</a></p> <p>While today’s sector wide selloff dragged Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings lower, its recent record tells a different story, with a 30 day share price return of 7.21% and a one year total shareholder return of 128.13% hinting that longer term momentum has been strong even after short term volatility.</p> <p>If this move in financials has you looking wider than a single insurer, it could be a good moment to scan the market for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">96 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings now trading at an intrinsic value premium and a strong multi year total return behind it, you have to ask: is there still upside here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings currently trades on a P/E of 24.7x, compared to a peer average of 17.8x and an Asian insurance sector average of 12x, which points to a rich valuation against both local and broader industry groups.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much investors are paying for each ₪1 of current earnings. For an insurer such as MGDL, a higher P/E often reflects expectations for steadier earnings quality, prospects for future profitability, or simply strong demand for the shares relative to recent earnings, even when near term profit trends are mixed.</p> <p>In MGDL’s case, the company is flagged as having high quality earnings and a modest 1.1% annual earnings growth rate over the past 5 years. However, earnings fell 56.9% over the last year and net profit margins declined from 10.6% to 2.1%. Against that backdrop, a 24.7x P/E suggests the market is placing a higher price on each unit of current earnings than on peers, despite recent pressure on profitability and a return on equity of 7.6% that is described as low.</p> <p>The comparison to the Asian insurance industry average P/E of 12x is even more stark. MGDL’s multiple is more than double that level, which signals that buyers are willing to pay a premium relative to regional insurers with lower P/E ratios. If the P/E were to move closer to those lower peer or regional averages, it would imply a very different price for the same earnings base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 24.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, there are clear risks, including the recent 56.9% earnings drop, the thinner 2.1% net margin, and a valuation premium that could unwind if sentiment cools.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-mgdl/migdal-insurance-and-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view from the SWS DCF model</h2> <p>The P/E of 24.7x already looks full, but our DCF model paints an even starker picture, with an estimated future cash flow value of ₪7.35 versus the current price of ₪16.95.

The new US$1.00 billion buyback may support near term earnings per share and capital returns, but it does not materially change the key risk that slowing digital audience growth or weaker real estate activity could weigh on future revenue and margins.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development alongside the buyback is News Corp’s continued dividend of US$0.10 per share for the half year to December 31, 2025. Taken together, the dividend and repurchase authorization highlight a heavier emphasis on returning cash to shareholders at a time when digital real estate, data services, and subscription businesses remain central to the company’s growth and earnings story.</p> <p>But while higher capital returns may look appealing, investors also need to be aware of how concentrated earnings have become in a smaller set of core segments, and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-nwsa/news/m1rw3d8h-digital-information-and-real-estate-will-shape-a-strong-future-s4oy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on News (it's free!)</a></p><p>News’ narrative projects $9.3 billion revenue and $754.0 million earnings by 2028.

This latest quarter does not remove those risks, but it may ease some concerns around execution.</p> <p>The new US$600 million stock repurchase program is the announcement most directly tied to this earnings release, because it adds a more visible capital return angle to the story just as all three segments delivered 5% core sales growth.

It is often used for early stage or loss making businesses where earnings are not yet meaningful. For a clinical stage biotech with no revenue and ongoing losses, a higher P/B can reflect how investors are weighing the company’s pipeline, expected future cash flows, and funding needs against its current balance sheet.</p> <p>Here, Cogent’s 11.4x P/B is described as good value relative to its peer average of 19.1x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock at a discount to similar names focused on comparable areas.

Over a longer stretch, a 26.2% 1 year total shareholder return and 53.0% 5 year total shareholder return indicate that investors who stayed invested through recent capital raises and earnings movements have, so far, been rewarded.</p> <p>If the AI linked power demand story has you looking beyond a single utility, this could be a good moment to scan <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting list of grid focused names to research next.</p> <p>So with Portland General Electric raising about US$480 million, reporting US$306 million in net income, and leaning into AI related demand, is the current share price offering value or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.1% Overvalued</h2> <p>Portland General Electric’s most followed narrative puts fair value at about $52.32, slightly below the last close of $53.96, which frames the current AI and PacifiCorp excitement as already largely reflected in the price.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Robust and sustained demand growth from industrial and data center customers is accelerating system wide electricity usage, underpinned by Oregon's strong technology sector and regional electrification objectives; this is expected to solidly grow PGE's revenue base and support long term earnings expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing transition to clean energy including major renewable procurements (2023 and 2025 RFPs) and battery storage integration position PGE to capitalize on declining renewable costs and federal tax credits, which should drive rate base growth, lower operational costs, and support future margin improvement.</em></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/dlz3g6mc-analyst-commentary-highlights-raised-targets-and-battery-storage-gains-for-portland-general-electric\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how steady demand, cleaner generation, and a higher future earnings multiple all fit into one price tag?

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $2.78b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest free cash flow reaching around $3.70b by 2030, with a path that moves through projected figures such as $2.81b in 2026 and $3.46b in 2029, all in US dollars.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $462.30 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $307, this implies a 33.6% discount, which indicates that the shares screen as undervalued under this particular set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Public Storage is undervalued by 33.6%.

It captures both what the business is earning today and how the market is weighing its prospects and risks.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more cautious multiple. The question is not whether a P/E is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Public Storage currently trades on a P/E of 33.99x. That sits above the Specialized REITs industry average of 15.86x, and below the peer group average of 41.55x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Public Storage is 34.36x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given the company’s earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it tries to account for the specific mix of growth, risk and profitability that is unique to Public Storage.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 33.99x very close to the Fair Ratio of 34.36x, the shares screen as ABOUT RIGHT on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Public Storage into a clear story that links its business outlook to a financial forecast, then to a fair value, all inside Simply Wall St’s Community page where millions of investors share their assumptions. You can compare a more upbeat view that leans toward the higher US$350 price target with a more cautious view closer to US$287, see how each Narrative’s fair value stacks up against today’s share price, and watch those fair values update automatically as new earnings, guidance or news come through.
