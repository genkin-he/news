            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Sysmex shares are now priced attractively or still have further to fall, this article walks through what the current share price might be implying about the company's value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at ¥1,467, after a 9.6% move over the past 7 days, a modest 0.3% return over 30 days, and longer term returns of a 4.4% decline year to date, a 44.9% decline over 1 year, a 45.0% decline over 3 years, and a 58.1% decline over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Sysmex has focused on its position in the healthcare sector and how investors are reassessing companies in this space, especially those with established products and global reach. This backdrop helps frame why the share price has shifted recently and why some investors are rechecking their assumptions about what a fair price looks like today.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Sysmex currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>, meaning it screens as undervalued on half of the metrics we track.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is ¥27,423.60 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations point to projected free cash flow of ¥50,425.75 million by the year ending March 2030, with a series of annual projections between now and 2035 that Simply Wall St has discounted back to today.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are added and discounted, the model arrives at an estimated fair value of ¥1,567.57 per share. Compared with the recent market price of ¥1,467, the DCF output implies Sysmex trades at about a 6.4% discount to this estimate, which places it in the “roughly in line” bucket rather than looking extremely cheap or expensive.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Sysmex is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

When investors expect stronger growth or see lower risk, they are usually willing to accept a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower P/E.</p> <p>Sysmex currently trades on a P/E of 20.4x. That is close to the Medical Equipment industry average of 15.5x and very similar to the peer average of 20.5x, so on simple comparisons the stock looks roughly in line with similar names rather than clearly cheap or expensive.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might make sense for Sysmex given its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk factors. This is more tailored than a straight peer or industry comparison because those benchmarks do not adjust for company specific strengths or weaknesses. For Sysmex, the Fair Ratio is 26.6x, which is higher than the current 20.4x P/E, suggesting the shares trade below this estimate of fair value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You will often see very different takes on Sysmex. For example, one Narrative might assume a much higher fair value than today’s price, while another assumes a much lower one, reflecting different expectations for its future.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Sysmex? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/6869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $39.24 million. Looking ahead, analysts have Innodata generating free cash flow of $27.35 million in 2026, with further annual projections out to 2035 extrapolated from those inputs by Simply Wall St rather than based on direct analyst estimates.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $12.53 per share.

It ties directly to the bottom line, which is ultimately what supports a share price over time.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E often reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Innodata currently trades on a P/E of about 45.1x. That is above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x and also above the peer average of about 21.8x, so on simple comparisons the stock carries a premium.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Innodata is 27.2x. This proprietary metric is designed to estimate a P/E that fits the company’s own profile, including its earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than just lining it up against broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 27.2x with the actual P/E of 45.1x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you set out your story about Innodata, link that story to explicit forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform turns it into a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price on the Community page used by millions of investors.

The Average Return on Equity used is 13.75%, against a Cost of Equity of $1.08 per share. The difference between what the bank is expected to earn and what investors require, the Excess Return, is $1.05 per share.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value is set at $15.51 per share, using weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. These inputs are combined in the Excess Returns framework to arrive at an intrinsic value estimate of about $44.95 per share.</p> <p>Comparing this to the current share price of $33.45 indicates the stock is about 25.6% undervalued according to this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests First Financial Bankshares is undervalued by 25.6%.

It is widely used because it links directly to the earnings that ultimately support dividends and retained capital.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E partly reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually comes with a lower P/E.</p> <p>First Financial Bankshares currently trades on a P/E of 18.77x. That sits above the Banks industry average of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.98x, which on simple comparisons can make the shares look relatively expensive. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might be reasonable given factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. For First Financial Bankshares, the Fair Ratio is 12.72x, which is meaningfully below the current 18.77x and suggests the shares trade richer than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, you can set up a Narrative for First Financial Bankshares that connects what you believe about its business to a financial forecast and a fair value, then compare that fair value to the current price to help you decide whether it looks attractive or not right now. Narratives are easy to adjust and are updated when new information like news or earnings arrives, so your view does not stay stuck on old data. For example, one investor might see First Financial Bankshares as worth well above today’s price while another might see it as worth well below, and those different fair values sit side by side on the platform so you can judge which story you find more convincing.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for First Financial Bankshares? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FFIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

On a last twelve months basis, the company reported free cash flow of a $448.9 million loss, so the valuation leans heavily on future projections rather than recent cash generation.</p> <p>The projections indicate free cash flow turning positive and reaching $1,233 million in 2028, with further annual figures out to 2035 derived from analyst inputs and extrapolations by Simply Wall St. These ten-year free cash flow estimates, all in dollars, are then discounted back using the DCF framework.</p> <p>According to this model, the estimated intrinsic value is about $61.83 per share, compared with the current share price of around $25.02. This difference suggests a 59.5% discount to the DCF estimate, indicating that the shares are trading materially below this model’s assessment of value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is undervalued by 59.5%.

This makes it a useful cross check against the DCF result you just saw.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E is usually shaped by how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and perceived resilience can justify a higher multiple, while more risk or slower growth often points to a lower one.</p> <p>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings currently trades on a P/E of 17.17x. That sits below the Hospitality industry average of about 23.54x and the peer group average of 43.21x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 35.89x, which reflects factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry. It adjusts for company specific characteristics rather than assuming all firms deserve the same multiple. Set against this Fair Ratio of 35.89x, the current P/E of 17.17x suggests the shares are trading at a discount on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NCLH P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/654e2d37-dd13-432b-8818-b17595112856/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NCLH P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

It then compares that fair value with the current share price to help you decide whether you see room to buy more, trim or simply watch.</p> <p>Because Narratives on Simply Wall St update automatically when new earnings, news or valuation inputs are added, you can see in real time how different views stack up. For example, one Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Narrative currently anchors on a fair value near US$19.00, while another sits closer to about US$45.00, showing how two investors using the same company can reach very different conclusions based on their assumptions and what risks or opportunities they choose to focus on.</p> <p>For Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives give you a structured way to line up your view of the business with specific assumptions on growth, margins and a fair value, so you can see exactly what would need to be true for your thesis to hold.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/s8dfnukw-norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-will-continue-to-rise-in-2025?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish Narrative: US$45.00 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: about 44% below the Narrative fair value at the recent price of US$25.02</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth in the Narrative: 26.04% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on cruise travel demand, with AAA data pointing to record US cruise passengers in 2025 compared with both last year and pre COVID levels.</li> <li>Highlights recent refinancing of US$1.8b of senior notes and access to a US$1.7b revolving facility as key moves to reshape the balance sheet and extend debt maturities.</li> <li>Points to sector wide strength, technical momentum, a US$34 price target from one major bank and ongoing fleet investments as reasons the author sees meaningful upside potential.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/eydrh5kh-tighter-environmental-rules-and-heavy-debt-will-squeeze-margins-x2g6?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this cautious Narrative: US$19.00 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: about 32% above the Narrative fair value at the recent price of US$25.02</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth in the Narrative: 9.27% per year</p> <ul> <li>Flags tighter environmental regulation, overtourism concerns and potential restrictions at key ports as long term risks for costs, access to high value routes and demand.</li> <li>Emphasizes the company’s debt load and interest costs, as well as demographic shifts among younger travelers, as constraints on reinvestment and earnings power.</li> <li>Works through a bearish analyst framework that assumes 8.2% annual revenue growth, higher profit margins and a future P/E of 10.1x, leading to a US$23.00 bearish price target that sits close to the recent share price.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame a wide range of outcomes, from a bullish view anchored on strong cruise demand and refinancing progress to a more cautious stance centered on regulation, leverage and capacity risks.

The stock trades at $26.3, with a 7.2% gain over the past five years but a 1 year return of an 18% decline and a 3 year return of a 4.7% decline, which points to a bumpier recent stretch. Those mixed results help explain why new developments on rates, regulation, and expenses matter so much at the moment.</p> <p>The key questions center on how much relief potential Fed rate cuts might provide against rising insurance, tax, and compliance costs, and how regulators ultimately shape the rules for large owners of single family rentals.

Fed policy decisions and any change in commentary around institutional ownership of single-family homes could influence both borrowing costs and sentiment.

Analysts provide specific Free Cash Flow estimates for the coming years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path. On this basis, projected Free Cash Flow reaches $209.8 million in 2030, with additional years beyond that also modeled in millions of US dollars.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $91.95 per share. Compared to the recent share price of US$7.35, this suggests the stock is 92.0% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CorMedix is undervalued by 92.0%.

It helps you compare CorMedix with other businesses that also generate earnings in the same sector.</p> <p>A higher or lower P/E often reflects what the market expects for future growth and how risky those earnings might be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk can justify a lower one.</p> <p>CorMedix currently trades on a P/E of 3.56x. That is below the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.89x and below the peer average of 9.43x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” for CorMedix of 15.70x, which is an estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for growth characteristics, risk and profitability instead of assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. When you compare CorMedix’s current P/E of 3.56x with the Fair Ratio of 15.70x, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you compare that Fair Value with today’s price and decide if CorMedix at, say, a more bullish US$22.00 view or a more cautious US$14.00 view is closer to your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CorMedix? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/CRMD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This quarter’s results do not remove those risks, but they do improve Sunrun’s financial footing.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is Sunrun’s completion of the PG&amp;E Local PeakShift Power season, where over 1,000 customer systems delivered nearly 1,200 hours of highly accurate dispatch. Paired with storage attachment rates reaching 71% by year end 2025, this grid services performance gives more substance to the idea that batteries and virtual power plants could become a meaningful earnings driver, potentially offsetting some pressure from expiring tax credits and higher financing costs over time.</p> <p>Yet while the profit rebound is encouraging, investors should also be aware that concentrated policy risk around solar tax credits could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunrun (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunrun's narrative projects $2.9 billion revenue and $465.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunrun's forecasts yield a $22.74 fair value</a>, a 11% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa2a4c7-de78-47ca-906e-c5edae8a6116/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this surprise profit, the most bearish analysts assumed almost flat revenue growth near US$2.1 billion and no profitability, so their far more cautious view of Sunrun’s financing and policy risks may shift meaningfully as investors reassess those assumptions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Sunrun</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The new 2026 revenue guidance of US$3.05–3.15 billion reinforces that diversification story but does not materially change the near term focus on execution in higher margin categories or the key risk around ongoing pricing and regulatory pressures.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement here is the nationwide opioids settlement, which commits Amneal to up to US$88.5 million in cash payments and up to US$177.4 million in naloxone product. That settlement helps clarify a major legal overhang just as management is asking investors to weigh its revenue outlook and pipeline against elevated leverage and the cost of maintaining compliance and quality across a broad portfolio.</p> <p>Yet behind this clearer revenue outlook and legal visibility, investors should still be aware of...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals/3tt90axt-amrx-recent-fda-approvals-and-pipeline-launches-will-drive-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Amneal Pharmaceuticals (it's free!)</a></p><p>Amneal Pharmaceuticals’ narrative projects $3.5 billion revenue and $207.9 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals/3tt90axt-amrx-recent-fda-approvals-and-pipeline-launches-will-drive-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Amneal Pharmaceuticals' forecasts yield a $15.20 fair value</a>, a 5% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AMRX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/de8755ce-faf4-4170-8a24-89d67d81be0e/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>AMRX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$11.94 to about US$70 per share, showing how far apart individual views on Amneal’s potential can be.

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model. It updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive, and is available on the Community page where millions of investors share their own versions.</p> <p>For example, one National Energy Services Reunited Narrative might align with the bullish analyst fair value of US$30.00, built around confidence in hydraulic fracturing capacity and MENA contracts. Another could sit nearer the cautious US$10.00 view that focuses on regional concentration and energy transition risks. Seeing those side by side can help you decide whether the current US$25.14 price is above or below the story you find most convincing.</p> <p>For National Energy Services Reunited, here are previews of two leading National Energy Services Reunited narratives that may help frame the discussion:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/lj4o0x5w-rising-mena-demand-will-boost-oilfield-service-expansion-mfij?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 National Energy Services Reunited Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 16.1% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 19.65% a year</p> <ul> <li>Supports a higher fair value case built around hydraulic fracturing scale in Saudi Arabia, contract visibility across MENA and higher profit margins tied to technology and efficiency gains.</li> <li>Assumes National Energy Services Reunited can sustain robust revenue growth and margin expansion, with future earnings and P/E considered consistent with a US$30.00 anchor valuation.</li> <li>Notes meaningful risks from oilfield concentration, regional exposure and capital intensity, so the optimistic outcome still depends on execution and stable operating conditions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/1sh65zqm-revenue-recovery-and-sector-rebound-will-drive-long-term-shareholder-returns?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 National Energy Services Reunited Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this more cautious narrative: US$22.14 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 13.5% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.93% a year</p> <ul> <li>Frames the story around solid MENA contracts and Jafurah exposure, but anchors fair value closer to US$22.14, even with updated analyst targets around US$30.</li> <li>Builds in steady revenue growth and margin improvement, while assuming a more modest future P/E multiple compared with the bullish view.</li> <li>Highlights contract concentration, capital demands, working capital strain and long term energy transition as key risks that could keep the share price nearer this fair value.</li> </ul> <p>Viewed together, these narratives provide two different sets of assumptions for National Energy Services Reunited that can be compared with the current US$25.14 share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for National Energy Services Reunited? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/NESR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
