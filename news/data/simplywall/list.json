The latest half-year result, with higher sales, earnings and a lifted interim dividend, supports the near term catalyst of cash generation and balance sheet strength, but does not remove key risks around margin pressure, rising operating costs and an uncertain retail backdrop.</p> <p>The interim dividend increase to A$2.10 per share for the half year ended 31 December 2025 stands out here, because it directly reflects the company’s current profitability and cash flow. For investors watching margin pressure from promotions and higher store wages, this payout decision is closely tied to how confident management is in sustaining earnings, especially as sales become more concentrated around discount periods and the cost base continues to rise.</p> <p>Yet beneath the stronger dividend, investors should still be aware of how intensifying discounting and promotional activity could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/retail/asx-jbh/jb-hi-fi-shares/o4l038g1-supply-chain-improvements-and-eands-acquisition-will-strengthen-future-operations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on JB Hi-Fi (it's free!)</a></p><p>JB Hi-Fi's narrative projects A$11.7 billion revenue and A$540.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/retail/asx-jbh/jb-hi-fi-shares/o4l038g1-supply-chain-improvements-and-eands-acquisition-will-strengthen-future-operations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how JB Hi-Fi's forecasts yield a A$102.05 fair value</a>, a 24% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/retail/asx-jbh/jb-hi-fi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:JBH 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fd50d480-e95c-453e-beb4-a5d56dd232ed/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:JBH 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this result, the most optimistic analysts were assuming revenue of about A$13.0 billion and earnings near A$601.6 million by 2028, so if you worry about e commerce erosion and slower store expansion, it is worth comparing that upbeat story with how the latest numbers might shift both the bullish and more cautious views.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/retail/asx-jbh/jb-hi-fi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 12 other fair value estimates on JB Hi-Fi</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 79% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The new Grade A MiQ methane certification strengthens CRC’s environmental credentials and may support pricing under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, but it does not materially change the near term earnings catalyst around the upcoming March 2 results or the central permitting and regulatory risk.</p> <p>The MiQ announcement lines up most directly with CRC’s push to maximize value from lower methane intensity production and its broader decarbonization projects, including carbon capture and storage. Analysts were already watching how CRC balances capital returns with investments in CCS and emissions reduction, and this expanded certification gives more real world evidence of progress on that front, even as forecasts still call for modest revenue growth and shrinking profit margins.</p> <p>Yet against this positive certification story, investors should be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-crc/california-resources/hbvb0txi-regulatory-reforms-and-ccs-projects-will-reshape-energy-amid-uncertainty-ud7v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on California Resources (it's free!)</a></p><p>California Resources' narrative projects $3.0 billion revenue and $161.5 million earnings by 2028.

The key near term drivers still sit in execution against its cloud and supply chain software opportunity, plus how the market responds to guidance around margins and growth. The planned CFO transition to long‑time insider Linda Pinne, with Dennis Story staying on as advisor, looks designed to limit disruption rather than reset strategy, and the recent share price pullback suggests investors are not treating the news as thesis‑changing. The bigger question remains whether the company can keep justifying a higher valuation after a year of weaker share returns and moderating earnings growth.</p> However, investors should be aware of how much they are paying for that growth profile.\n\nDespite retreating, Manhattan Associates' shares might still be trading 44% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MANH 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/932912c6-0960-4475-b00a-aa3676dad717/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MANH 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 4 other fair value estimates on Manhattan Associates</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 78% more than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The investment case still revolves around veligrotug’s FDA Priority Review with a June 30, 2026 PDUFA date, the parallel EMA filing, and the upcoming elegrobart Phase 3 readouts, which together remain the main near term share price catalysts. The latest results reinforce the trade off: modest quarterly revenue alongside a much larger full year net loss of about US$342.6 million, now coupled with a fresh US$16.33 million employee stock shelf that adds a bit more dilution on top of recent capital raises. On balance, this news does not rewrite the key catalysts, but it does sharpen the focus on cash burn, dilution and execution risk around a potential first commercial launch.</p> However, investors should not overlook how rising losses and new share issuance could influence future returns.\n\nViridian Therapeutics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-vrdn/viridian-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-vrdn/viridian-therapeutics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"VRDN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d75ae204-42f2-4a86-82bb-947371770408/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>VRDN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span from just US$0.18 to over US$160 per share, underscoring how differently people size up Viridian’s prospects.

The 2025 net loss of C$140.86 million sharpens the focus on near term catalysts like Kiniero’s ramp-up to commercial production, successful execution under the Sprott debt facility, and the company’s ability to turn recent capital raises into stable operating cash flow. At the same time, it brings existing risks into clearer view: aggressive use of equity financing, a relatively new management team and board, and a business that is still unprofitable with rising historical losses. With the share price already up strongly over the past year, this earnings hit looks material to the risk side of the story, even as the core project thesis remains unchanged.</p> However, one key funding and dilution risk here is easy to underestimate.\n\nRobex Resources' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-rbx/robex-resources-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-rbx/robex-resources-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:RBX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b882300b-bad9-4903-a48e-7ab6f8c195a1/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:RBX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span C$2.90 to C$16.92, underlining how far opinions diverge.

The recent selloff on rising credit risk and inflation worries goes straight to today’s key catalyst and risk: whether the bank can keep loan losses contained in commercial real estate while stabilizing earnings after flat sales and falling EPS.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the recent dividend increase to US$0.38 per share is relevant because it signals the board’s current view of earnings strength and capital flexibility, even as credit concerns rise. For shareholders, it highlights the tension between a continuing income stream and growing questions about asset quality, particularly in commercial real estate and other potentially stressed loan categories.</p> <p>Yet beneath the reassuring dividend track record, there is a concentration risk in commercial real estate that investors should be aware of, especially if...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/banks/nasdaq-caty/cathay-general-bancorp/13p76qon-asian-american-demand-and-digital-banking-will-strengthen-performance-u3fm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Cathay General Bancorp (it's free!)</a></p><p>Cathay General Bancorp's narrative projects $964.1 million revenue and $393.8 million earnings by 2028.

The latest results and capital return moves support the near-term earnings and cash flow story, but they do not fully remove the key near-term risk around timing delays on large projects and the longer term exposure to a single region and its regulatory and industrial cycles.</p> <p>The newly announced US$50 million share repurchase program through 2027 is especially relevant here, because it sits alongside a growing dividend and rising earnings, and together they draw more attention to how dependable LandBridge’s cash generation really is. If project timing, Permian-specific risks or customer concentration cause lumpier results than expected, that could challenge the perception that this level of capital returns is comfortably supported by the underlying business...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-lb/landbridge/w8mc63ex-sunbelt-urbanization-and-permian-expansion-will-create-future-value-ezki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on LandBridge (it's free!)</a></p><p>LandBridge's narrative projects $321.7 million revenue and $184.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-lb/landbridge/w8mc63ex-sunbelt-urbanization-and-permian-expansion-will-create-future-value-ezki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how LandBridge's forecasts yield a $73.00 fair value</a>, in line with its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-lb/landbridge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"LB 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1544c9f8-d4e7-434d-9e5a-3f4e5f55821d/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>LB 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this news, the most pessimistic analysts were assuming revenue of about US$296.1 million by 2028 and earnings of roughly US$186.3 million, yet still highlighted how long project lead times and potential delays in renewables or data center build out could leave earnings growth uneven.

It concluded that the MXDA operation would not secure sufficient profit, so investors now face a clearer, though narrower, capital allocation path.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company.</a></p> <p>The decision to shut down the Dutch MXDA project comes after a period of strong share price momentum, with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company’s 30 day share price return of 41.73% and 90 day return of 61.78%, alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 97.88% that outpaces its shorter term moves.</p> <p>If this kind of portfolio reshaping has you looking beyond a single chemicals name, it could be a good moment to scan the market using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company posting strong recent returns yet still trading at a small intrinsic discount, is the MXDA setback already reflected in the share price, or is the market quietly pricing in additional developments?</p> <h2>Preferred Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On our numbers, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company trades on a P/S of 1.1x, which screens as good value against peers even after the recent share price strength.</p> <p>P/S compares the company’s market value to its revenue and is often used for businesses where earnings are uneven or currently negative. This is the case here, with a reported loss of ¥16,252.0 on revenue of ¥739,862.0.</p> <p>At 1.1x, the market is paying a lower sales multiple than the peer average of 1.8x. This points to a discount on current revenue even though the company is unprofitable and forecast revenue growth of 4.1% a year is slower than the wider JP market forecast of 5.2%.</p> <p>Compared to the JP Chemicals industry average P/S of 0.8x, however, the shares sit at a premium. Our estimated fair P/S of 1x suggests some scope for the multiple to gravitate closer to that level over time if expectations cool or execution disappoints.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the recent loss of ¥16,252 and the board’s willingness to scrap projects that fall short against that small intrinsic discount.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle, our DCF model</h2> <p>While the 1.1x P/S ratio suggests Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company is only slightly ahead of our fair ratio, our DCF model points to a different angle.

The latest quarter’s US$60.33 million in revenue and US$37.48 million in net income, alongside 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million, supports that tower-focused story, but the key near term risk remains execution on this pivot and the durability of carrier demand rather than the recent handset or retail wireless headlines, which are not especially material here.</p> <p>Among recent developments, management’s 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million stands out as the clearest reference point for the new tower-heavy model. It effectively replaces the prior wireless service metrics as the main yardstick many investors will watch against Array’s current valuation and income profile. How consistently the company delivers within or above that range, and how that ties to tower lease activity with carriers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, is likely to shape near term sentiment around the stock.</p> <p>Yet beneath this clearer tower story, investors should still be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/telecom/nyse-ad/array-digital-infrastructure/m7bdsy5m-t-mobile-deal-and-tower-agreements-will-drive-digital-infrastructure-transition\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Array Digital Infrastructure (it's free!)</a></p><p>Array Digital Infrastructure’s narrative projects $3.6 billion in revenue and $173.7 million in earnings by 2028.

For Mazda, that high multiple sits against low net profit margins of 0.2% and a Return on Equity of 0.5%, which suggests the price is not being anchored by recent profitability.</p> <p>Relative signals back this up.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Nippn (TSE:2001) has announced plans to issue ¥20 billion in unsecured corporate bonds, carrying a 1.983% fixed coupon and maturing in 2031. This funding decision can influence views on its capital structure.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Nippn.</a></p> <p>At a share price of ¥2,867.0, Nippn has seen a 9.14% 1 month share price return and a 19.56% 3 month share price return, while its 1 year total shareholder return of 38.06% and 5 year total shareholder return of 97.55% point to momentum that has been building over time as investors reassess growth prospects and risk around moves like the new bond issue.</p> <p>If this bond news has you thinking about where capital might flow next, it could be a good moment to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> as fresh ideas for your watchlist.</p> <p>With the new ¥20 billion bond issue on the table and the share price already reflecting solid recent returns, the real question for you is whether Nippn is still undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 11.5x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nippn’s shares closed at ¥2,867, and at that price the stock is described as trading on a P/E of 11.5x, with several checks pointing to it being on the cheaper side versus fair value estimates and peers.</p> <p>The P/E multiple compares the current share price with the company’s earnings per share. It gives a quick sense of how much investors are paying for each unit of profit. For a mature food business like Nippn, investors often look at this ratio to judge whether they are paying up for stability or getting a lower entry point relative to the sector.</p> <p>According to the data, Nippn is described as “good value” on several fronts. Its P/E of 11.5x is below an estimated “fair” P/E of 12.8x. It is also lower than the JP Food industry average of 17x and below a peer average of 14.6x, which suggests the market is pricing Nippn’s earnings more cautiously than many comparable companies.</p> <p>This kind of discount relative to both a fair ratio and sector peers can sometimes reflect concerns mentioned elsewhere, such as earnings being forecast to decline and recent pressure on profit margins, rather than any single short term event.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nippn</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 11.5x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh risks such as the 4.92% decline in annual net income and any strain from higher leverage after the ¥20b bond issue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nippn narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Huge Gap On Our DCF Model</h2> <p>There is a very different picture when you look at Nippn through our DCF model. At a share price of ¥2,867, the stock is described as trading at a very large discount to an estimated future cash flow value of ¥27,048.18. This raises questions about how much risk or conservatism is built into that model.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"2001 Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/07145fc1-608b-44d6-b952-93229a566f2b/chart/dcf?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>2001 Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out Nippn for example</a>).
