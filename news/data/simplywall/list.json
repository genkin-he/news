Still, with a 19.5% total shareholder return over the past year and gains of more than 90% for long-term holders over three years, the company’s longer-term trajectory remains solid even as recent momentum fades.</p> <p>If you’re curious about what other stocks are showing strong growth potential and attracting insider confidence, now is the perfect moment to widen your search and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still trading below analyst price targets and the company showing strong long-term growth, the key question for investors is whether Performance Food Group is now undervalued or if the market has already priced in its future gains.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 19.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>Performance Food Group’s most widely followed narrative suggests the stock trades notably below its estimated fair value, with a $120.75 fair value based on the latest consensus, compared to a recent close at $97.08.

Let’s hear the catalyst driving this view.</p> <blockquote> <p><em> Bullish analysts see the announcement of a significant $600 million share buyback as a positive signal, highlighting management’s conviction in the company’s cash generation and belief that the shares are undervalued.<br/> Projections for generating over $1 billion in free cash flow over the next four years bolster confidence in Hexcel’s ability to support future investments, shareholder returns, and strategic initiatives.\n    </em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/j5w0gm3m-share-buyback-and-free-cash-flow-will-strengthen-aerospace-and-defense-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>How are analysts justifying that extra upside?

Hexcel is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 82.1x, which stands well above the US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 41x and the fair ratio estimated at 38.3x. This significant gap could mean the stock carries extra valuation risk if market sentiment changes, despite optimism about future growth.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins.

Momentum is clearly building, with a year-to-date share price return of nearly 125% and five-year total shareholder return topping 650%, which represents a remarkable long-term trajectory by any measure.</p> <p>Inspired by this kind of sustained growth?

For Merus, this high multiple signals that the market is attaching significant value to its future growth potential rather than current profitability or net asset base.</p> <p>Compared to the US biotechs industry average of 2.5x, Merus’s ratio is notably rich. This suggests that either the company is commanding a justified premium based on anticipated revenue growth, or enthusiasm is running well ahead of fundamentals.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Panasonic Holdings is a smart buy right now? Let's dig into what the numbers and the market are really saying about the company's true worth.</li> <li>After climbing 14.1% over the past month and up an impressive 38.0% for the last year, Panasonic's share price has caught more eyes, which could potentially signal new growth optimism or shifting risk expectations.</li> <li>Driving these moves are recent headlines around Panasonic’s expanding EV battery partnerships and renewed momentum in green tech.

This process gives investors an idea of what the business is truly worth in the present.\n</p> <p> For Panasonic Holdings, the latest figures show that current Free Cash Flow (FCF) is approximately ¥98.3 billion. Analyst projections and Simply Wall St extrapolations suggest this could rise to around ¥620 billion by 2030, indicating significant growth expectations. In the first five years, analyst consensus informs the FCF outlook, while later years are based on modeled growth rates beyond the window of analyst certainty.\n</p> <p> All numbers are in Japanese yen. The DCF analysis arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of ¥4,189 per share. Comparing this to the current trading price implies the stock is about 56.9% undervalued, suggesting a strong margin of safety for potential investors.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Panasonic Holdings is undervalued by 56.9%. Track this in your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>, or discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">831 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows</a>.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"6752 Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2649ef90-d9c3-488d-95af-4660ebb4ea56/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>6752 Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Panasonic Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Panasonic Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p> For established and consistently profitable companies like Panasonic Holdings, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuation. It helps investors understand how much they are paying for each yen of current earnings. The PE ratio typically rises for businesses with higher growth expectations and lower perceived risks, while it sits lower for companies facing headwinds or cyclical challenges.\n</p> <p> Panasonic Holdings currently trades at a PE ratio of 11.5x, just below the Consumer Durables industry average of 11.6x. However, compared with its peer group, which features an average PE of 31.4x, Panasonic appears much more conservatively valued. These benchmarks provide useful context, but they do not capture the full picture of a company's unique strengths, risks, or growth trajectory.\n</p> <p> That is where Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio comes into play. The Fair Ratio, calculated here at 24.7x, factors in Panasonic’s earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, risk profile, and its industry placement. This approach goes well beyond a surface-level comparison to peers or industry averages. Since Panasonic’s actual PE ratio is well below its Fair Ratio, this suggests that the shares may be attractively priced for long-term investors seeking value.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6752 PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2649ef90-d9c3-488d-95af-4660ebb4ea56/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6752 PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1394 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Panasonic Holdings Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your unique view or story about Panasonic Holdings, bringing together your assumptions about its future revenue, earnings, and margins into a single, logical forecast for what the company is worth.\n</p> <p> Instead of just relying on industry multiples or static price targets, Narratives let you connect the company's business story to a tailored financial forecast, producing your own personal estimate of fair value. With Simply Wall St's Community, millions of investors can publish Narratives, making it easy for anyone to explore or contribute forecasts based on changing news or market developments. All of this can be done in just a few clicks.\n</p> <p> Narratives are dynamic and constantly updated as new information arrives, empowering you to make more timely decisions. For example, some investors believe Panasonic’s innovations in energy storage and cost control will drive earnings above ¥580 billion by 2028, supporting a fair value over ¥2,500 per share. Others see policy risks and execution challenges limiting future profits to ¥375 billion, setting fair value closer to ¥1,500. Narratives help you compare these views side by side, so you can decide which story and price best fit your own perspective.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Panasonic Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6752 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2649ef90-d9c3-488d-95af-4660ebb4ea56/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6752 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Revenue is projected to increase at 5.9% per year, which trails the broader Hong Kong market’s 8.7% pace, while profit margins dipped slightly from 2% to 1.9% year over year.

This highlights a wide valuation gap.</li> <li>Rather than just reflecting weak growth, the prevailing view is that this low valuation could be driven by a mix of steady earnings quality and investor caution around the company's slower revenue and earnings growth forecasts compared to the broader Hong Kong market.\n    <ul> <li>Peers are growing faster. Revenue and earnings in the Hong Kong market are forecast at 8.7% and 12.4% annually, about double or more than Xinhua Winshare's pace.</li> <li>Despite this, Xinhua Winshare's high-quality earnings and margin improvements offer a buffer.

This suggests investors are applying a steep discount relative to long-term cash flow prospects.</li> <li>While sector momentum benefits digital-first companies, the prevailing view is that Xinhua Winshare's discount could signal undervaluation if the company continues to translate its strong margins into sustainable growth, even at a slower pace than the market.\n    <ul> <li>The combination of rising profitability and a share price well under fair value creates tension for investors deciding whether the market is overlooking stable, high-quality earnings.</li> <li>Valuation support is further reinforced by the absence of material risks outside the caution flagged on dividend sustainability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to undergo a reversal of fortunes, which has elevated the P/S ratio.  If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price.     </p> If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-psnl/personalis/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Personalis</a>. <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/S?  </h2><p> Personalis' P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the industry.  </p><p> Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any revenue growth to speak of for the company over the past year.   Fortunately, a few good years before that means that it was still able to grow revenue by 5.1% in total over the last three years.  So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing revenue over that time.   </p> <p> Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 26%  per annum as estimated by the eight analysts watching the company.  With the industry only predicted to deliver 7.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result. </p><p> With this in mind, it's not hard to understand why Personalis' P/S is high relative to its industry peers.  It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.  </p> <h2> What Does Personalis' P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Shares in Personalis have seen a strong upwards swing lately, which has really helped boost its P/S figure.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of Personalis' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook is contributing to its high P/S.  Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/S as they are quite confident future revenues aren't under threat.

You're in the right place to find out what is really driving its value.</li> <li>After a solid 83.8% gain over the last five years, the stock has cooled off recently, down 1.4% in the past week and 10.5% year-to-date. This illustrates how quickly sentiment and risk perceptions can shift.</li> <li>Recent headlines about shifting global energy demand and volatility in commodity prices have fueled both optimism and caution around oil and gas producers. Coterra has been especially visible as analysts weigh in on its capital spending strategy and the broader outlook for natural gas markets.</li> <li>On our proprietary valuation checks, Coterra Energy scores an impressive <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>, suggesting strong all-round value.

This approach helps investors gauge whether a stock's market price reflects its potential to generate cash over time.\n</p> <p> For Coterra Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow stands at $1.50 Billion. Analysts provide detailed cash flow forecasts out to 2029, with projected Free Cash Flow rising to $2.60 Billion by that year. Over the full 10-year model horizon, which includes both analyst forecasts and methodical extrapolations, the company’s cash flows remain strong and show healthy growth. The pace moderates in later years as projections move beyond analyst coverage and rely on broader industry assumptions.\n</p> <p> According to this DCF model, Coterra’s intrinsic value is estimated at $65.90 per share. This implies the stock is trading at a 64.5% discount to its calculated fair value, suggesting that it is significantly undervalued based on projected future cash generation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coterra Energy is undervalued by 64.5%.

It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. Since earnings influence long-term shareholder returns, the PE ratio is especially useful for comparing companies within the same industry or across the broader market.\n</p> <p> A company's fair PE ratio depends on more than just profits. Growth expectations play a significant role; faster-growing companies often command higher multiples, while uncertainties or heightened risk can result in lower valuations. Stable profit margins and larger market capitalizations also tend to increase what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE.\n</p> <p> Coterra Energy is currently trading on an 11.33x PE multiple. This is below the Oil and Gas industry average of 12.59x and also comfortably under the peer group average of 16.72x. To provide a fuller picture, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" for each company that blends key factors such as expected earnings growth, industry trends, company size, profit margins, and risk. For Coterra, the Fair Ratio is 18.33x, indicating the stock is valued well below what would be expected given its underlying fundamentals.\n</p> <p> By using the Fair Ratio, investors gain a more tailored sense of value rather than relying solely on industry or peer averages. This approach adjusts for the nuances that make Coterra unique, capturing both upside growth and risk factors in a way that broad benchmarks cannot.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Coterra Energy Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a practical way for investors to tie together their view of a company's story, like Coterra's growth drivers or risks, with their forecasts for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins. This approach ultimately helps determine what they believe to be a fair value for the stock.\n</p> <p> Narratives connect the dots between \"what's happening at the company\" and \"what the numbers mean,\" allowing you to set your own assumptions and see the financial impact. On the Simply Wall St platform, Narratives are easy for anyone to create or follow within the Community page, empowering millions of users to document their perspectives and update them as news or earnings releases come in.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly see if your Fair Value signals a buy, hold, or sell opportunity compared to today's Price. Because these are updated dynamically with new information, they help you make timely, better-informed decisions.\n</p> <p> For example, one investor might build a Narrative assuming robust LNG-driven revenue growth and land at a Fair Value of $40. Another investor, more cautious on gas prices and regulatory risks, may set their Fair Value closer to $25. This demonstrates how your story shapes your strategy.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coterra Energy? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

However, its latest results disappointed the market because non-GAAP numbers missed expectations amid higher loan loss provisions.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-dcom/dime-community-bancshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Dime Community Bancshares.</a></p> <p>After a tough quarter marked by higher loan loss provisions and a cautious outlook, Dime Community Bancshares has seen its short-term momentum fade. The share price dropped 11.7% over the past month and is down 13.2% year-to-date. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at -9.2%, long-term holders are still up a robust 64% over five years, showing the value of patience through the bank’s cycles. Ongoing executive transitions and new branch openings may offer fresh catalysts, but for now, investor sentiment remains cautious given recent earnings volatility.</p> <p>If this volatility has you curious about other opportunities, now’s the perfect moment to expand your watchlist and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>With shares now trading at a substantial discount to analyst targets, the crucial question is whether Dime Community Bancshares is undervalued after recent setbacks or if the market is simply reflecting realistic expectations for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 26.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Dime Community Bancshares closing at $26.34 and the most popular narrative setting fair value over $36, this large gap has fueled fresh optimism among narrative followers. Speculation now centers on the assumptions needed to justify such a bullish outlook as the bank’s stock trades far below analyst consensus.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing digital transformation, new business lending verticals, and further rationalization of the branch network are set to drive operational efficiencies and lower costs, enabling sustained improvement in net margins over time.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/wxe57v30-expanding-new-york-banking-network-will-unlock-future-potential-a0d8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how bold changes in branch strategy, technology, and loan moves could support this target?

Dime Community Bancshares’ current price-to-earnings ratio is 22.8x, which is not only above the US Banks industry average of 11x but also above its fair ratio of 20.8x. This signals the market is pricing in strong growth, which brings higher expectations and risk if the company falls short.
