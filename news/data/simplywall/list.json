As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.    However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For Yoram Naveh Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> According to our data, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has a market capitalization of ₪15b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth ₪3.3m over the year to December 2024.   That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!      We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this more detailed historical graph</a> of earnings, revenue and cash flow.  </p> <h2>Has Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period.  This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. </p><p> Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive.  While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow.  To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive (India) has an accrual ratio of -0.16 for the year to September 2025.   That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit.    In fact, it had free cash flow of ₹14b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of ₹13.3b.    Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.  </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Profit Performance</h2><p> Happily for shareholders, Colgate-Palmolive (India) produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers.      Because of this, we think Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem!     And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of Stove Kraft's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE </h2><p> It is hard to argue that Stove Kraft's ROE is much good in and of itself.   An industry comparison shows that the company's ROE is not much different from the industry average of 8.9% either.   Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 10% seen by Stove Kraft over the last five years is not surprising.    </p><p> However, when we compared Stove Kraft's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 16% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9674015-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761871371113\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:STOVEKRAFT Past Earnings Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Stove Kraft is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Stove Kraft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> When we piece together Stove Kraft's low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (where it is retaining 75% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth.  This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Only recently, Stove Kraft stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we have mixed feelings about Stove Kraft.      While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Jindal Steel </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target held steady at ₹1,093, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.        Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation.  There are some variant perceptions on Jindal Steel, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at ₹1,400 and the most bearish at ₹600 per share.   Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/materials/metals-mining\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's clear from the latest estimates that Jindal Steel's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 30% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.6% p.a. over the past five years.    Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 11% annually.  Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Jindal Steel is expected to grow much faster than its industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results.        Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   We have estimates - from multiple Jindal Steel analysts - going out to 2028, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> You should always think about risks though.

In the automotive sector, where margins can be thin and growth cyclical, this multiple is a common benchmark for valuation. A lower P/E can indicate undervaluation or expectations of slower growth ahead.</p> <p>At 10.9x, Suzuki Motor stands out as attractively priced, especially when compared to the Japanese market average of 14.3x and the Asian auto industry’s 21.4x. The company also looks inexpensive next to its peer group’s average of 14.9x and even the fair price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1x calculated by regression analysis.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> Korean Reinsurance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Korean Reinsurance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761871433884\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Korean Reinsurance is not owned by hedge funds.      Our data shows that In-Soon Jang is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding.       Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.      Additionally, the company's CEO Jong-Gyu Won directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.   </p> <p> On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.  </p> <p> While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Korean Reinsurance</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Korean Reinsurance Company.   It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful ₩446b stake in this ₩1.9t business.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Korean Reinsurance.   This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Korean Reinsurance better, we need to consider many other factors. </p> <p> <strong>I like to dive deeper</strong> into how a company has performed in the past. You can find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">historic revenue and earnings in this <strong>detailed graph</strong></a>. </p> <p> But ultimately <strong> it is the future</strong>, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You should always think about risks though.

The recent volatility in precious metal pricing has affected sentiment across the sector, but it has not materially altered Wheaton's biggest short-term catalyst: expanding production from Salobo III and Blackwater. At the same time, the largest risk remains the future availability of attractive, high-margin streaming deals to support long-term revenue expansion.\n</p> <p> Among recent company announcements, Wheaton’s reaffirmed production guidance for 2025 stands out. This is relevant as it underpins the current growth narrative, linking directly to new output from Salobo III and Blackwater.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company’s inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine’s filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company’s current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company’s discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is.  As with many other companies <strong>PDS Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PDSL</a>) makes use of debt.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is PDS's Net Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2025 PDS had debt of ₹11.0b, up from ₹9.76b in one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of ₹10.5b, its net debt is less, at about ₹530.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/225670672-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761871252616\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PDSL Debt to Equity History October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is PDS' Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, PDS had liabilities of ₹29.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of ₹2.44b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of ₹10.5b and ₹14.2b worth of receivables due within a year.   So it has liabilities totalling ₹6.87b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, PDS has a  market capitalization of ₹52.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.    Carrying virtually no net debt, PDS has a very light debt load indeed.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for PDS </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> PDS has a very low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.15 so it is strange to see weak interest coverage, with last year's EBIT being only 2.4 times the interest expense.  So while we're not necessarily alarmed we think that its debt is far from trivial.        Unfortunately, PDS's EBIT flopped 13% over the last four quarters.  If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine PDS's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, PDS produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for PDS was the fact that it seems able handle its debt, based on its EBITDA, confidently.  However, our other observations weren't so heartening.   In particular, interest cover gives us cold feet.       When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about PDS's use of debt.  While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 2 warning signs for PDS</strong> </a> you should be aware of.    </p> <p> If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our list of net cash growth stocks</a> without delay. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Hawthorn Bancshares (HWBK) reported net profit margins of 27.5%, a sharp improvement compared to 7.5% a year ago. EPS surged 389.3% over the past twelve months. This turnaround stands in contrast to the company’s five-year average, which saw earnings decline by 11% per year. Shares trade at a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 10.2x, lower than both peer and industry averages. This signals an attractive valuation relative to US bank stocks. The company’s management is also recognized for delivering high quality earnings as profitability rebounds.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-hwbk/hawthorn-bancshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Hawthorn Bancshares.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers side by side with the dominant narratives shaping investor expectations, examining which stories are confirmed and which might require updating.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

This highlights a valuation discount that may appeal to bargain-seeking investors.</li> <li>Prevailing market view suggests this lower valuation multiple is a magnet for value portfolios, as Hawthorn Bancshares is not only less expensive than the average US bank but comes with profit margins that have recently strengthened.\n    <ul> <li>Value-focused investors are drawn to the combination of lower price multiples and improving profitability, seeing both as potential drivers of future returns.</li> <li>Yet, the company’s five-year history of earnings declines reminds investors that short-term valuation advantages may need sustained financial momentum to translate into outperformance.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.
