            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>OneStream (OS) has just released a new study spotlighting how CFOs are becoming central to driving organizational AI strategies. The report illustrates growing expectations for AI investment, yet points to lingering challenges around realizing value at scale.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-os/onestream\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for OneStream.</a></p> <p>Over the past year, OneStream’s 1-year total shareholder return has fallen 40.6 percent, reflecting ongoing investor caution even as annual revenue grows and interest in enterprise AI keeps building. Despite upbeat sentiment around the company's innovation, the 7-day share price return was positive. However, year-to-date movement and the 90-day share price return both indicate that momentum is still fading.</p> <p>If OneStream’s latest AI push has you thinking bigger, it may be the perfect time to broaden your investing search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Given OneStream’s expanding AI ambitions and current discounts to analyst price targets, should investors view recent share declines as an undervaluation?

This sets the table for a deeper look into the justifications behind an optimistic view on future growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing large-scale digital transformation across industries, with CFOs increasingly seeking unified platforms to replace legacy financial systems, strongly positions OneStream to capture expanding market share, supporting sustained subscription revenue and new customer growth. Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts. This is positioning OneStream's cloud-native Intelligent Finance Platform for higher recurring and ratable revenues and contributing to predictable top-line expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jcg9s894-digital-transformation-and-cloud-adoption-will-fuel-market-opportunities-czbv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know what’s fueling such a big fair value gap? The narrative is anchored on bold projections about international expansion and sticky recurring revenues.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development. This initiative is closely linked to iFAST’s recurring revenue ambitions and operational leverage, as onboarding moves toward completion. Efficient execution here could support ongoing profit and margin improvements, but the risk lies in managing rising expenses without delay.\n</p> <p> However, it’s important to remember that not all drivers of growth are within management control, particularly if...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/sg/diversified-financials/sgx-aiy/ifast-shares/jg59binl-digital-banking-and-ai-integration-will-expand-global-reach-kacr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on iFAST (it's free!)</a></p><p>iFAST's narrative projects SGD716.4 million revenue and SGD163.0 million earnings by 2028.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso. Given its expertise and recent disciplined CapEx positioning, this could drive future revenue growth as delayed customer investment resumes, especially with policy and economic clarity.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/810soabx-clean-fuel-demand-and-semiconductor-expansion-will-transform-global-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What are the bold assumptions driving this valuation?

The company currently trades at 22.4 times earnings, which is higher than the peer average of 14.5 times and the industry’s 13.2 times.

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat.

You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

One common approach is to try and find a company with <em>returns</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Although, when we looked at <strong>Wienerberger</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIE:WIE</a>), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

To calculate this metric for Wienerberger, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.073 = €346m ÷ (€6.3b - €1.6b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Wienerberger has an ROCE of 7.3%.</strong> On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 7.2%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Wienerberger </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/416194-roce-1-dark-2/1761827143455\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">WBAG:WIE Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Wienerberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

The company has employed 36% more capital in the last  five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 7.3%.   Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.   </p><h2> Our Take On Wienerberger's ROCE </h2><p> In conclusion, Wienerberger has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.       And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 29% to shareholders over the last  five years.  Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.    </p><p> If you'd like to know about the risks facing Wienerberger, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign</strong></a> that you should be aware of.   </p><p> While Wienerberger may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The Q3 2025 results reinforce MercadoLibre's user growth and revenue momentum, though EPS missed due to higher spending on shipping, marketing, and credit, underscoring that the biggest short-term catalyst remains fintech user growth, and the risk of rising credit losses is still front of mind. The recent results confirm these themes without materially shifting near-term risks or opportunities.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement is MercadoLibre’s Q3 earnings report, which showed revenue up 39% year-over-year, outpacing forecasts and fueled by a surge in unique active buyers and strong adoption of Mercado Pago’s services. This growth supports the key catalyst of accelerating fintech and payments adoption, but also highlights the company’s increased exposure to credit risk and the challenges of maintaining margins as credit and logistics investments scale.</p> <p>However, investors should be aware that rapid growth in the credit portfolio, while fueling revenue, exposes MercadoLibre to unexpected spikes in delinquency and ...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/retail/nasdaq-meli/mercadolibre/ez5w8rcx-digital-retail-and-mercadopago-adoption-will-fuel-future-markets-b0pt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MercadoLibre (it's free!)</a></p><p>MercadoLibre's narrative projects $46.9 billion revenue and $5.1 billion earnings by 2028.

While the one-year total shareholder return clocks in at an eye-popping 765%, the short-term pullback this month is a reminder that rapid growth can also bring volatility.</p> <p>If you're watching these swings and wondering what else could be next, it might be the perfect moment to broaden your investing radar and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With such staggering gains and fast-growing revenues, the real question now is whether Ondas Holdings remains attractively undervalued, or if these big returns mean the market has already priced in all the future growth ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 28.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>With analysts assigning a fair value nearly 29% above the most recent closing price, Ondas Holdings is attracting attention for its perceived upside potential. This narrative is based on both sector momentum and a dramatic re-rating of future earnings potential, which could be a turning point for ambitious investors.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ondas anticipates record revenue growth in 2025, primarily driven by Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS), due to significant backlog and expanding programs with Optimus and Iron Drone systems in defense and homeland security sectors. This will directly impact revenue.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jb11frfj-analyst-optimism-grows-for-ondas-holdings-amid-strong-sector-momentum-and-upward-valuation-revisions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious about what’s fueling this bullish take? One crucial detail: the growth engine behind this premium valuation hinges on expansion into defense tech and cutting-edge autonomy.

The company’s price-to-book ratio stands at 26x, much higher than both the US Communications industry average of 2.3x and its peer average of 11.8x. This signals that investors are paying a steep premium compared to the broader sector, which could mean higher valuation risk if growth stumbles.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Expro Group Holdings to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Expro Group Holdings' Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Expro Group Holdings' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Expro Group Holdings' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     Furthermore, it has done a great job growing EPS over the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    In terms of investment risks, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>we've identified 1 warning sign </strong>with Expro Group Holdings</a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Expro Group Holdings' profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it’s gotten too pricey? Let’s dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco’s new store openings and bold expansion plans. These moves reinforce its reputation for consistent growth. The excitement around its international push and updated membership offerings has investors debating whether recent price moves reflect new opportunities or fresh risks.</li> <li>Costco currently lands a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. By several standard checks, this suggests it may be fully valued or even pricey right now. Let’s break down exactly how we arrive at that score in the next section and, even more importantly, look at what makes for a smarter way to judge value that goes beyond traditional methods.</li> </ul> <p>Costco Wholesale scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today’s dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco’s intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company’s current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company’s share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry’s average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco’s stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco’s PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco’s case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco’s current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco’s current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio. This means that, even after considering Costco’s growth, margins, and market-leading position, the stock appears to be overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1382 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers—such as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks—to your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company’s real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Its 1-month share price return sits at 31.8%, with a remarkable 98.9% rise year-to-date. Short-term momentum is clearly building, and the company’s 3-year total shareholder return of 172.9% shows how investor interest can gather pace when exploration milestones suggest deeper value may be unlocked.</p> <p>If you’re keen to expand your shortlist beyond resources, now’s a smart time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But with FireFly’s share price already surging following recent drilling results, does the stock still offer value at current levels?

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly’s elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project.

This could cap ARPU and slow subscriber acquisition, negatively impacting top-line growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/3omtzrem-low-cost-competition-and-high-capex-will-weaken-latin-american-networks-74lm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know which future financial levers analysts are betting on?
