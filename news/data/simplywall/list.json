            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Bitmine Immersion Technologies at around US$20.44 is priced for its story or offering genuine value, you are not alone.</li> <li>The stock has seen a 2.4% gain over the last 7 days, a 30.3% decline over the past month, a 34.5% decline year to date, and a 263.3% return over the past year, which signals shifting views on its potential and risk.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Bitmine Immersion Technologies has focused on its role in immersion cooling and crypto related infrastructure, along with how that niche positioning can influence sentiment when crypto markets or related stocks are in focus. This backdrop helps explain why the share price can experience sharp moves in relatively short periods.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Bitmine Immersion Technologies currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 out of 6</a>.

It is most useful when a company has a clear, sustainable dividend track record.</p> <p>For Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the model uses a recent dividend per share of US$0.01 and applies a 3.41% dividend growth rate, which is based on the risk free rate rather than company specific trends. The model also includes a reported return on equity of 59.96%, but no payout ratio is provided, so the link between earnings, reinvestment and dividends is unclear.</p> <p>Based on this input set, the DDM output suggests an intrinsic value of about US$0.18 per share. When compared with the current share price of around US$20.44, this framework describes the stock as very heavily overvalued, with an intrinsic discount figure of 11,130.3%.</p> <p>Given how sensitive the DDM is to small changes in dividend and growth assumptions, these results should be treated as a rough reference point rather than a precise target.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Dividend Discount Model (DDM) analysis suggests Bitmine Immersion Technologies may be overvalued by 11130.3%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BMNR Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BMNR Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Bitmine Immersion Technologies.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Bitmine Immersion Technologies Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies where earnings are volatile or free cash flow is negative, the price to book, or P/B, ratio can be a more grounded way to think about value. It compares what the market is paying for each dollar of net assets to what sits on the balance sheet.</p> <p>In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/B multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often line up with a lower P/B. So the question is not whether a P/B is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Bitmine Immersion Technologies currently trades on a P/B of 0.83x. The wider Software industry sits around 2.71x, and the peer group average is 14.17x, so the stock is pricing its book value at a discount to both groups. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio concept goes a step further. It estimates the P/B you might expect after factoring in elements like earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, risk profile and the industry context, rather than relying on blunt comparisons.</p> <p>Because no Fair Ratio is available here, you cannot directly judge whether 0.83x points to overvaluation or undervaluation using that proprietary metric alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSEAM:BMNR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSEAM:BMNR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you tell the story behind your numbers by linking your view of Bitmine Immersion Technologies’ business to your own forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins. These then flow through to a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide if it looks attractive or stretched. Because Narratives update automatically when new news or earnings are released, you might see one investor setting a cautious fair value well below US$20.44 while another, more optimistic about crypto infrastructure, sets theirs well above that level.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Bitmine Immersion Technologies? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSEAM/BMNR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSEAM:BMNR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSEAM:BMNR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

However, the size of that HK$900 million item and the move from a loss of HK$317 million in the prior 12 months to HK$840 million now means part of the earnings jump reflects clean up effects rather than just ongoing rental strength.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to data driven loyalty programs and curated retail that are already linked with higher tenant sales and traffic, but these sit beside a period where basic EPS on a trailing basis moved from HK$0.03 to HK$0.31 with help from that one off adjustment.</li> <li>If you are leaning toward the bullish story, it is worth separating what comes from steady HK$3,326 million to HK$3,551 million revenue over the last few reported periods and what is tied to that HK$900 million event.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E premium and 21.2% earnings growth forecast</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of HK$21.82, the trailing P/E of 26.7x sits well above both peers at 14.2x and the wider Hong Kong real estate industry at 14.4x, while earnings are forecast to grow about 21.2% per year and revenue is forecast at 3.7% annual growth versus 8.6% for the market.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to a business that could lift earnings meaningfully over time, but the combination of a P/E almost double peer levels and revenue growth forecasts that trail the broader market invites questions about how much of that 21.2% earnings growth is already reflected in today’s HK$21.82 price.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts are effectively assuming stronger margins can do the heavy lifting, while the DCF fair value of HK$11.15 sits well below the current price, which suggests the market is comfortable paying up based on those margin assumptions.</li> <li>If you prefer to stress test that view, you might compare the current premium multiple and DCF fair value gap with what you would expect given revenue growth that is below the 8.6% market forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On a strong earnings growth story priced at a 26.7x P/E, some investors want to see exactly how bullish analysts think this can go before they decide how to weigh that premium. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1c6fv52l-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hysan Development Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Debt coverage and dividend pressure</h2> <ul> <li>The company offers a 4.95% dividend yield, yet dividends are flagged as not well covered by earnings and debt is described as not well covered by operating cash flow, which makes the balance sheet a key watchpoint alongside the income stream.</li> <li>Bears highlight that weaker debt coverage and reliance on instruments like perpetual securities can leave less headroom if rental conditions stay tough, and the data here backs their focus because cash flow coverage of debt and dividend payout are both identified as pressure points rather than strengths.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also note that while trailing margins look strong at 24.2%, that sits beside concerns about refinancing costs and the need to keep funding projects like Lee Garden Eight and other developments.</li> <li>If you are weighing the cautious view, the combination of a near 5% yield, limited earnings cover, and flagged debt coverage risk gives you a clear list of financial items to track in the next few reporting periods.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> When dividends are not well covered and debt coverage is marked out as a risk, some investors prefer to walk through the cautious case in detail before committing fresh capital. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/40zdes1c-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hysan Development Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/mz19jazy-14-consistent-outlook-will-sustain-momentum-amid-stability-in-core-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Hysan Development on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Reading through this, you can probably sense both enthusiasm and caution in the story.

Short term, the key catalysts remain earnings delivery against the updated FY2025/26 guidance, the recently increased dividends, and how the market continues to price a low P/E against modest growth forecasts. The Ishikariwan Shinko Unit 2 acceleration fits into this by modestly reinforcing the investment story around supply stability, but it also underscores the ongoing need for heavy capex in a business where debt is not well covered by operating cash flow and dividend cover looks tight. Given the already strong share price gains, this project tweak looks more incremental than transformational to the near term risk‑reward.</p> However, investors should be aware of how rising capex could strain cash generation and dividends.\n\nHokkaido Electric Power Company's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 35%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c387b43e-a10f-4156-b065-ce343cad1687/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value estimate from the Simply Wall St Community centers tightly around ¥909.82 per share, contrasting with recent market pricing.

Vaxart trades on a P/S of 1.2x, while the fair ratio is just 0.1x, and both the US Biotechs industry at 12.5x and peers at 25.8x tell very different stories about what the market might adjust toward.

This suggests recent news is being viewed as a significant shift in growth prospects and risk profile rather than a short term move.</p> <p>If this AI server and cooling story has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to look across the wider theme through our screen of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential contenders in the same structural trend.</p> <p>With the shares up sharply and trading slightly above the latest analyst price target, yet showing a large intrinsic discount on some models, the key question is whether 2CRSI is still mispriced or if the market is already pricing in years of growth.</p> <h2>Price to sales premium versus fair value and peers</h2> <p>On the numbers provided, 2CRSI looks inexpensive against the SWS DCF estimate yet expensive on its preferred multiple, which is the P/S ratio. The share last closed at €27.70, while the SWS DCF model estimates a future cash flow value of €53.34, and the shares are described as trading 48.1% below that fair value.</p> <p>The SWS DCF model works by projecting future cash flows for the business and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. That approach tries to capture the specific earnings profile of 2CRSI, including factors such as forecast revenue and profit growth, rather than just comparing it to other tech names using a simple market multiple.</p> <p>Set against that, the preferred multiple being used here is the P/S ratio, which currently sits at 2.8x for 2CRSI. This is described as expensive compared to an estimated fair P/S ratio of 0.6x, and also expensive against the European tech industry average P/S of 0.7x, even though it is below a selected peer group average P/S of 4.3x. That mix of signals shows the market is already paying more per euro of sales than broad sector and regression based benchmarks, while still assigning a lower tag than some direct peers.</p> <p>Put simply, the P/S of 2.8x stands well above both the 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average. That represents strong relative pricing that investors will want to weigh against the large DCF gap. If the market ever moves closer to the SWS fair P/S level suggested by the regression work, that would imply a very different share price than today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for 2CRSI</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-sales of 2.8x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also need to factor in execution risks around turning €220.857m of revenue into stronger profitability, as well as the recent rapid share price swings.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this 2CRSI narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on what the price implies</h2> <p>While the P/S of 2.8x looks rich against a 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average, the SWS DCF model points the other way, with a fair value of €53.34 versus the current €27.70, described as 48.1% below fair value.

On one hand, HP outperformed expectations on both revenue and EPS, with net revenue of US$14.4b compared to US$13.5b a year earlier and non GAAP EPS above consensus. On the other, operating income fell and management is guiding toward the lower end of its full year earnings ranges as DRAM and NAND costs pressure margins. That combination often leads to short term share price weakness, which you are already seeing. However, it also gives you clearer information on how management plans to handle higher input costs through product re configuration, supplier diversification and selective price increases. The fact that HP maintained its fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS range of US$2.47 to US$2.77 while outlining a US$1b cost savings plan suggests management is trying to balance investment in AI PCs with disciplined capital returns, including US$0.6b returned in Q1 and continued buybacks. Against a backdrop of insider share sales and mixed institutional flows, this quarter is likely to be read as a test of whether HP can convert strong AI PC demand into durable earnings power rather than just a one off beat.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The HP Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The strong Q1, with AI PCs at more than one third of shipments and Personal Systems growth, supports the narrative that AI driven PCs and premium devices can underpin revenue and margin resilience.</li> <li>The sharp rise in memory costs and guidance toward the low end of EPS ranges challenges the view that cost restructuring alone can fully offset input cost pressure and structural headwinds in Print.</li> <li>The specific memory cost inflation and the US$1b mitigation plan through FY2028 add more detail on cost risks and timing that are only partially reflected in the existing narrative about restructuring and supply chain diversification.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/9fda6tiy-ai-demand-and-margin-pressures-will-shape-performance-amid-digital-sector-shifts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for HP</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Rising DRAM and NAND prices are creating a roughly US$0.30 full year EPS headwind, which could keep Personal Systems margins below the long term range if mitigation falls short.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts and risk models highlight four key risk factors, including negative shareholders’ equity and concerns around dividend stability and leverage, which may limit how aggressive HP can be with buybacks and payouts.</li> <li>🎁 AI PCs already account for over 35% of shipments, supporting the view that HP can benefit if the PC refresh cycle and demand for higher spec devices continue to support the Personal Systems segment.</li> <li>🎁 Management is pursuing US$1b in gross run rate savings by FY2028 and has continued to return capital through buybacks and dividends, which some investors may see as supportive of per share metrics if executed carefully.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, how quickly memory cost inflation stabilises or is offset through supplier agreements, product design changes and pricing. Second, whether AI PC growth remains strong enough to support revenue and operating margins, especially compared with peers like Dell, Lenovo and Apple in higher end PCs.

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extends those projections further out. In this case, free cash flow is projected at ¥82,950.00m by the year ending March 2030, with ten year forecasts combining analyst inputs for the nearer years and extrapolated estimates thereafter. All figures are expressed in ¥ and discounted using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about ¥6,259 per share. Compared with the recent share price of ¥12,650, the model implies the stock is around 102.1% above this estimate, which points to a valuation that is rich relative to these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Sumitomo Metal Mining may be overvalued by 102.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 20 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>5713 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Sumitomo Metal Mining.</a></p> <h2>Approach 2: Sumitomo Metal Mining Price vs Earnings</h2> <p>For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each unit of earnings. A higher P/E usually reflects higher market expectations for future earnings or a lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E often aligns with more modest expectations or higher perceived risk.</p> <p>Sumitomo Metal Mining currently trades on a P/E of 36.0x. That sits above the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 14.5x and also above the peer group average of 34.9x. On simple comparisons, the market is assigning a richer earnings multiple to the stock than to the broader industry and its peer set.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Sumitomo Metal Mining is 21.7x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a more “normal” P/E might look like for the company, taking into account factors such as earnings growth profile, profit margins, size, industry and stock specific risks. Because it blends these elements rather than relying only on broad peer or industry averages, the Fair Ratio can provide a more tailored reference point.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 21.7x with the current P/E of 36.0x suggests the shares are trading well above this earnings based reference level.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5713 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you see how different assumptions translate into different fair values.</p> <p>Once you have a Narrative, you can compare its Fair Value to the current share price. This can help you decide whether the market price looks attractive, stretched or somewhere in between, based on your own assumptions rather than only a single model output.</p> <p>Narratives also update when new information such as news or earnings is added to the platform, so your story and fair value can stay aligned with the latest data instead of becoming stale.</p> <p>For Sumitomo Metal Mining, one investor might build a Narrative with relatively cautious revenue growth and margins, while another might assume stronger demand and profitability. The Community page allows you to see how those different inputs lead to different fair values.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Sumitomo Metal Mining? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/5713\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5713/sumitomo-metal-mining-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5713 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/da29ae93-0c5f-4fe7-ba99-48a8c104a1f7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5713 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That implies an average Return on Equity of 15.62% on a Stable Book Value of US$23.44 per share, which comes from estimates by 5 analysts.</p> <p>The required return for shareholders, or Cost of Equity, is set at US$2.19 per share. The difference between what the company is expected to earn and this required return is the Excess Return, estimated at US$1.47 per share. The model then projects these excess returns forward and discounts them back to arrive at an intrinsic value of about US$48.13 per share.</p> <p>Against the recent share price of US$36.85, this implies the stock is around 23.4% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital is undervalued by 23.4%.

It gives you a quick sense of how many years of current earnings the market is effectively pricing in.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends a lot on growth expectations and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or more predictable cash flows can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Right now, HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital trades on a P/E of 23.97x. That sits above the Diversified Financial industry average of about 16.57x and above the peer average of 10.99x, so on simple comparisons the shares look more expensive than many alternatives.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is designed to refine that picture. Its Fair P/E of 15.36x for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital reflects factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks, rather than just broad peer or industry groupings. Because it ties the multiple directly to these fundamentals, it can provide a more tailored benchmark than raw averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 23.97x with the Fair Ratio of 15.36x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, a Narrative is your own explanation behind the numbers, where you set assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and the platform converts that into a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help you assess whether the stock looks worth buying, holding or selling. Narratives are not static, they update when fresh information such as news or earnings is added, so your fair value view can move with the company’s story. For example, one HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital Narrative might assume stronger project growth and assign a higher fair value, while another might assume more conservative funding conditions and arrive at a lower fair value.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HASI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hasi/ha-sustainable-infrastructure-capital\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/16359f8c-34f4-4302-89a7-1159e60d9e78/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HASI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This supports the idea of stronger profitability but also raises the question of how repeatable that combination is if project mix or costs shift.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/ZQM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Soilbuild Construction Group.</strong></a></p> <h2>EPS and profits step up each half</h2> <ul> <li>At the half year level, net income rose from S$7.4 million in 1H 2024 to S$19.2 million in 2H 2024 and S$28.3 million in 1H 2025, while basic EPS moved from S$0.0125 to S$0.0290 and then to S$0.0427 over the same three halves.</li> <li>Bulls point to this steady step up as a sign of improving earnings quality, and the trailing basic EPS of S$0.3845 versus the latest half year EPS of S$0.0427 highlights how much of the past year’s profit came from outside just this single half. Bullish investors may see this as helpful support for the view that the recent strength is not tied to a one off quarter, even though future periods will still need to back that up.</li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 10.6x versus peers at 20x</h2> <ul> <li>With the share price at S$1.02 and the provided P/E at 10.6x, the stock is described as trading below both the cited peer average P/E of 20x and the SG construction industry average of 14.2x, and also below the DCF fair value of about S$3.00.</li> <li>Supporters of a bullish stance argue that this lower multiple, alongside trailing net income of S$63.6 million and a 10.8% margin, supports the case that investors are paying less for each dollar of recent earnings. The cited forecasts of roughly 10.2% earnings growth and 12.4% revenue growth also indicate that expectations are not zero, so the valuation still assumes the business can at least hold close to its current profitability.</li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

At Comfort Systems USA, the CFO and two directors monetised shares shortly after the company reported very strong fourth quarter and full year 2025 numbers, highlighted an expanded US$11.94b backlog, and saw its stock move to very high levels. The CFO’s sale was sizeable in dollar terms, which tends to draw extra attention, especially when the stock has posted very large multi year returns and is trading near its highs. At the same time, Comfort Systems has just lifted its quarterly dividend from US$0.60 to US$0.70, which points to management confidence in the company’s cash generation. For you, the tension is between insiders taking some money off the table and a business that has just reported strong earnings, raised its dividend, and is deeply involved in data center and technology related projects that many investors view as long term themes.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Comfort Systems USA Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The record earnings, large backlog and stronger dividend fit with the narrative of Comfort Systems USA benefiting from reshoring capex, modular construction and technology driven projects.</li> <li>Heavy insider selling, particularly by the CFO, touches on one of the risks in the narrative that concentrates a lot of growth in large, complex technology and data center projects, which could face sector specific slowdowns.</li> <li>The increased focus on AI infrastructure and data centers, and the recent index inclusion, go further than the earlier narrative, which focused mainly on modular construction, reshoring and service revenue.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l6px86ww-industrial-reshoring-and-modular-demand-will-drive-results-into-2026\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Comfort Systems USA</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Concentration in technology and data center projects could become a problem if those end markets slow, given the size of the current backlog tied to these areas.</li> <li>⚠️ Recent significant insider selling, including by the CFO, breaks a pattern of limited insider selling over prior quarters and may signal that management sees the current share price as an attractive level to trim exposure.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings and revenue for 2025 were much higher than a year earlier, and the backlog of US$11.94b provides multi year visibility across mechanical, electrical and modular projects.</li> <li>🎁 The higher quarterly dividend of US$0.70 per share suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still funding growth in modular and service operations.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on the pattern of insider activity, not just one off sales. Repeated large disposals across several executives could carry a different signal to occasional profit taking. It is also worth tracking how much of the US$11.94b backlog is tied to technology and data center work versus more diversified commercial and industrial projects, as that mix affects both risk and margin potential. Finally, watch how Comfort Systems USA converts that backlog into revenue and cash flow while supporting higher dividends and any future capital returns, especially as it competes with other large contractors such as EMCOR Group and Quanta Services for complex projects.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Comfort Systems USA, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/FIX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Comfort Systems USA</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This context helps frame why the share price has been in focus for investors assessing how the business model and customer mix are being reflected in the market value.</li> <li>Our Simply Wall St valuation model currently gives Benchmark Electronics a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>, so next we will walk through the different valuation approaches behind that result and, at the end of the article, look at a broader way to think about what fair value really means for this stock.</li> </ul> <p>Benchmark Electronics scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates through 2027, including $60.7 million for 2026 and $39.9 million for 2027. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates free cash flow out to 2035, with projected figures such as $29.7 million in 2028 and around $19.7 million by 2035, all in dollars, and then discounts them back using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>Bringing all those discounted cash flows together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $10.06 per share under this DCF model. Compared with the latest share price of $59.18, this implies the stock is very expensive relative to this cash flow based estimate, with the model indicating it is 488.4% overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Benchmark Electronics may be overvalued by 488.4%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Benchmark Electronics.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Benchmark Electronics Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable business, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to see how much you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to what the company is currently earning, which is often the first anchor investors use when they look at valuation.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Benchmark Electronics is trading on a P/E of 85.0x, compared with an industry average of about 27.6x and a peer average of 63.8x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Benchmark Electronics is 42.3x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own profile rather than assuming all electronics companies deserve similar multiples. With the current P/E at 85.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 42.3x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out your story for Benchmark Electronics, link it to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and arrive at your own fair value. You can then easily compare this with the current price, view it alongside other Narratives on the Community page used by millions of investors, and watch it update automatically as new information like earnings or guidance comes in. One investor might build a Narrative that aligns closely with the current model fair value of about US$59.33, while another could plug in more cautious or more optimistic assumptions and land on a very different fair value. This in turn guides how each of them thinks about whether the share price is high, low or roughly in line with their view.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Benchmark Electronics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/BHE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This points to a large valuation gap based on that framework.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>CSL Limited exhibits strong fundamental characteristics, underpinned by leadership in plasma therapies and influenza vaccines, a robust R&amp;D pipeline, and clear drivers for earnings growth, particularly the ongoing recovery of CSL Behring's gross margin. The integration of CSL Vifor adds diversification, although it faces near term competitive pressures.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how that fair value is built? The narrative leans heavily on earnings expansion, margin rebuild in plasma, and a long runway of cash flows that are anything but simple.</p> <p>According to Ramsee, the author of this narrative, the valuation work uses a discounted cash flow model with a 4.0% discount rate and a long forecast period, treating CSL as a company whose cash generation can be projected and then brought back to today in A$ terms. The gap between the A$263.33 fair value and A$146.76 last close is tied to assumptions about revenue growth, margin recovery and capital intensity across Behring, Seqirus and Vifor, rather than short term share price moves.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of A$263.33 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_user_generated_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this hinges on tariff assumptions and CSL hitting its margin goals, with tougher US trade rules or slower Behring recovery both potential spoilers for that thesis.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/pharmaceuticals-biotech/asx-csl/csl-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this CSL narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another Way To Look At It: Earnings Multiple Check</h2> <p>Ramsee’s work leans on discounted cash flows, but the current P/E of 35.8x tells a different story. It sits above the Global Biotechs average of 29.5x and above the 29.3x fair ratio the market could move towards, even though it is below a 60.8x peer average.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Geely Automobile Holdings is attractively priced or not, this article will walk you through what the current share price might be implying about its value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at HK$16.31, with a 7 day return of 4.3% decline, a 30 day return of 1.3% decline, a year to date return of 10.4% decline, a 1 year return of 12.4% decline and a 3 year return of 66.1% alongside a 5 year return of 27.7% decline. This gives a mixed picture for investors weighing recent weakness against longer term performance.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Geely has focused on its position in the Hong Kong auto sector and how sentiment has shifted between traditional and newer energy vehicle makers. This helps frame these share price moves. Longer term discussions in the press about competition, regulation and consumer demand for different vehicle types also sit in the background for anyone trying to judge whether the current level makes sense.</li> <li>Right now Geely holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a> on our checks.

The latest twelve month free cash flow sits at about CN¥5.9b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2027, with CN¥31.5b projected for 2026 and CN¥33.7b for 2027, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to 2035, reaching a projected free cash flow of CN¥45.4b in that year.</p> <p>When all these projected cash flows are discounted back using the DCF model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at HK$45.24 per share. Compared with the recent share price of HK$16.31, this suggests the stock is 63.9% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Geely Automobile Holdings is undervalued by 63.9%.

This can be more meaningful than looking at revenue or assets alone.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on what the market thinks about a company’s earnings growth and risk. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Geely currently trades on a P/E of 9.41x. That sits below the Auto industry average of 19.30x and also below the peer group average of 10.79x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Geely is 11.12x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable after considering factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk. It can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for Geely’s own characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 9.41x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 11.12x, the shares appear undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b88141a8-605a-48f8-a2ba-1abfcf0c9a7d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.
