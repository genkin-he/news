Despite big moves in the sector and recent expansion of its power management and imaging technology portfolio, ON Semiconductor’s 1-year total shareholder return has slumped to -30.2%. Its 5-year total return is still up nearly 99%.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple. Such a wide premium suggests investors should take a hard look at the underlying growth assumptions that are driving KRMN's lofty valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Karman Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Preferred multiple of price-to-sales 28.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, signs of overvaluation and the stock trading below analyst price targets could trigger a sentiment shift if growth expectations are not fully realized.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Karman Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests Shares Are Overvalued</h2> <p>Looking at Karman Holdings through the lens of our SWS DCF model creates a starkly different picture.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Having said that, from a first glance at <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BVMF:AMBP3</a>) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Netskope (NTSK) stock has quietly moved higher over the past week, gaining 7% even as the rest of the market grappled with mixed signals. Investors are looking at how recent financial reports could influence its broader outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Netskope.</a></p> <p>Netskope’s 7-day share price return of 7.4% marks a clear uptick in momentum, helping to erase losses from earlier in the month. While the year-to-date share price return is a positive 4%, this latest rally suggests that investor optimism could be building as sentiment shifts around cybersecurity growth stories like Netskope.</p> <p>If today’s momentum has you curious about what else could be on the move, it’s the perfect chance to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_tech_and_ai_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/215171/high-growth-tech-and-ai-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With a share price rally underway and double-digit annual revenue growth, the main question becomes whether Netskope’s current valuation reflects untapped potential or if the market has already priced in the company’s future gains. Is this a real opportunity for buyers, or is investor optimism already factored in?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Sales Ratio of 14.5x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Netskope's current Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.5x, which is significantly higher than both its peers and the broader US Software industry. At a last close of $23.41, this premium valuation raises the question of whether investors are overestimating Netskope's potential compared to rivals.</p> <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current sales. It is often used for high-growth tech companies that may not yet be profitable. For expanding firms like Netskope, a higher multiple can reflect future growth expectations or strong market positioning. However, it may also indicate frothy sentiment if financial fundamentals lag behind those hopes.</p> <p>Specifically, Netskope's 14.5x P/S is almost double the peer group average of 7.5x and almost triple the US Software industry average of 5.4x. This sharp divergence suggests the market is either expecting superior growth or is currently overvaluing the company relative to peers, especially given that Netskope is not yet profitable.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 14.5x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, ongoing lack of profitability and a high valuation compared to peers could spark a turnaround if revenue growth slows or investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Netskope narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model Puts Valuation Into Question</h2> <p>Taking a different perspective with our SWS DCF model, Netskope appears even more stretched on valuation.

Rowe Price Group.</a></p> <p>The recent buzz around T. Rowe Price stems not only from its bold crypto ETF filing but also from a steady pace of updates, including new board appointments and the confirmation of its quarterly dividend. Although the year-to-date share price return has slipped 8.75%, its 1-year total shareholder return of -2.7% masks a more optimistic story. Momentum has picked up over the last three years with a total shareholder return of 13.6%.

The market sits below the narrative’s consensus, with expectations shaped by forecasts of revenue growth, profit margins, and disciplined execution in asset management.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Accelerating ETF product development and distribution, including new launches in both equity and fixed income, is opening access to new client segments such as RIAs and non-traditional channels. This is expanding reach and likely boosting net new asset inflows and overall AUM, which can stabilize or grow fee-based revenue streams.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/7zkvz1kt-retirement-solutions-and-global-etfs-will-unlock-future-value-plg0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What’s driving this premium?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if PulteGroup is currently undervalued or if you’ve missed your shot? You’re not alone, as many investors are buzzing about its long-term potential.</li> <li>The stock price has moved around lately, with a 9.8% gain year-to-date and significant gains over three years. However, a recent dip of 11.2% over the past month suggests some caution may be setting in.</li> <li>Big headlines have focused on the broader housing market’s swing in demand and builder optimism, which have influenced investor sentiment on homebuilders like PulteGroup.

This process helps investors judge what a business is really worth, not just what the market says.</p> <p>For PulteGroup, the DCF model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company's Free Cash Flow for the last twelve months came in at $1.56 billion. Over the next decade, analyst estimates and projections show some growth ahead, with Free Cash Flows expected to reach around $2.01 billion in 2027. Simply Wall St extends these forecasts out to 2035, using consensus and extrapolated figures to build a fuller long-term picture.</p> <p>Based on this model, the intrinsic fair value for PulteGroup is calculated at $154.61 per share. This suggests the shares are 23.5% undervalued relative to the current market price, which indicates upside potential for new and existing investors. The model points to a margin of safety, and PulteGroup’s cash generation outlook supports a compelling value case at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PulteGroup is undervalued by 23.5%.

When companies generate steady profits, the PE ratio offers a direct look at how the market values their underlying earnings power.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio typically depends on both growth expectations and perceived risk. Companies with stronger growth prospects, more stable earnings, or lower risk tend to justify higher PE ratios. Businesses facing uncertainty or slower growth are often priced lower on this metric.</p> <p>PulteGroup’s current PE ratio stands at 8.8x, which is meaningfully lower than the Consumer Durables industry average of 10.6x and also below the average for similar peers at 14.1x. On the surface, this could signal that the stock is undervalued compared to the broader sector.</p> <p>To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for PulteGroup at 15.0x. This metric aims to capture more nuance than a simple peer or industry comparison by factoring in the company’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry dynamics, market cap, and unique risk profile. The Fair Ratio helps avoid common pitfalls of benchmarking and puts all the fundamental information into a context tailored for PulteGroup.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 15.0x to the actual PE of 8.8x highlights a significant undervaluation in the shares. It suggests the company is trading at a hefty discount even after considering all relevant risks and growth opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1386 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PulteGroup Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives, an innovative, story-driven approach that connects your perspective on a company, like PulteGroup, directly to its future financial forecasts and your estimated fair value.</p> <p>A Narrative is simply your story for a stock, combining your expectations for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins with your own reasoning and assumptions about the business. Instead of relying solely on formulas, Narratives let you personalize valuation by linking what you believe about PulteGroup’s strategy or market opportunity to concrete financial scenarios.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's Community page, millions of investors are already using Narratives as an easy and intuitive tool to guide buy or sell decisions. Narratives clearly lay out your fair value, compare it to the current price, and give immediate feedback as to whether you see the stock as undervalued, overvalued, or fairly priced.</p> <p>Importantly, Narratives are dynamic. As soon as news or new earnings arrive, your Narrative updates so your conclusions always reflect the latest information. For example, some investors use a Narrative that emphasizes sustained growth from Sunbelt migration and active adult communities, resulting in a bullish fair value as high as $163.00. Others highlight margin pressure and affordability challenges, leading to a much lower fair value near $98.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PulteGroup? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

With shares closing last session at $94.04, this figure signals the market is assigning no premium to the business’s net assets in its current loss-making state.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio helps investors gauge whether a stock is valued above or below the value of its stated net assets. For Qnity Electronics, a 0% ratio shows that the company's liabilities completely offset its assets, reflecting a period of unprofitability and minimal tangible book value. In fast-evolving sectors like semiconductors, this can suggest the market is either discounting near-term risks or expecting a turnaround to take time.</p> <p>This dynamic raises the question: has the market already baked in all pessimism regarding future growth, or is there hidden value if profits rebound?</p> <p>Comparing to the broader semiconductor industry, Qnity Electronics’ price-to-book of 0% is exceptionally low. Most peers trade at a positive multiple, so this stands out as a warning signal for now. Without additional fair ratio benchmarks, it is difficult to project what level the market could move toward if fundamentals improve.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-q.wi/qnity-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 0% (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, limited transparency on growth drivers and continued losses could continue to weigh on sentiment.

Over the last five years, the company has grown earnings at a 7.5% annual rate, and forward-looking estimates peg earnings expansion at 8.9% per year, which is slower than the broader US market's expected 15.6% annual pace. Revenue is projected to climb 4.3% annually, which also trails the national benchmark. Notably, the most recent year’s earnings growth of 0.6% came in below the company’s five-year average. While the ongoing record of profit growth stands out, investors face a premium-priced stock, as Sherwin-Williams trades at 33.1x earnings, well above both industry and peer averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-shw/sherwin-williams\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Sherwin-Williams.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers under the microscope, comparing Sherwin-Williams’ results to the most widely held narratives in the market.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) has seen its stock fluctuate recently, moving down about 2% over the past month. Investors appear to be weighing the company's steady annual earnings growth in comparison to broader market shifts, fueling conversation about the current valuation.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-orly/oreilly-automotive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive.</a></p> <p>After a strong start to the year, O'Reilly Automotive’s recent 30-day share price return of -12.12% has cooled some of its earlier momentum. Even so, the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 21.99%. This pullback hints at shifting sentiment. It also follows a long run of robust long-term growth, so many investors are simply reassessing risks and expectations at these higher valuations.</p> <p>If you're curious how other parts of the market are performing right now, it's a smart moment to broaden your scope and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>The question now is whether O'Reilly Automotive's recent slide reveals an overlooked value, or if the market is simply factoring in all the growth that is yet to come.

O'Reilly's strategic emphasis on inventory and distribution capabilities, including a plan to increase average inventory per store by 5% in 2025, positions the company to maintain high availability and service levels. This approach will likely lead to sustained or increased revenue growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n8vnl9et-inventory-improvements-and-store-expansions-will-boost-retail-presence-welv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to see what powers this optimistic valuation?
