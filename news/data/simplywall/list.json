            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Flutter Entertainment (NYSE:FLUT) closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$4.7b and a basic EPS loss of US$0.05, alongside trailing twelve month revenue of US$16.4b and a TTM basic EPS loss of US$1.75. Over the past four reported quarters, revenue has ranged from US$3.7b to US$4.7b, while quarterly basic EPS has swung between a profit of US$1.59 and a loss of US$3.92. This sets up a mixed backdrop for a business that is still loss making on a TTM basis but is being assessed on strong earnings growth forecasts. Overall, the latest numbers keep the spotlight squarely on how quickly Flutter can tighten margins and move its TTM EPS closer to breakeven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Flutter Entertainment.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the table, the next step is to set these results against the widely followed narratives around Flutter's growth, profitability path, and risk profile to see which views are supported by the numbers and which ones get pushed back.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Flutter Entertainment</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb59a032-5d0c-48c8-83f7-3e6b451467f1/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Revenue climbs to US$4.7b, but profits still swing around</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly revenue moved between US$3.7b and US$4.7b, yet net income ranged from a profit of US$283 million in Q1 to a loss of US$690 million in Q3, showing that earnings are still quite sensitive even at higher sales levels.</li> <li>Bulls point to forecast revenue growth of about 10.9% a year and expected earnings growth of 42.6% a year as signs that this volatility could settle into a clearer path to profit, but the latest trailing 12 month loss of US$310 million keeps the bullish case tied to future execution rather than current profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters highlight that losses have been reduced over the past five years at around 2.9% a year, while revenue has reached US$16.4b on a trailing 12 month basis.</li> <li>At the same time, a TTM basic EPS loss of US$1.75 shows that, for now, the bullish view leans heavily on those forward growth assumptions rather than on the most recent earnings line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that these swings are the growing pains of a business building scale, and they focus on the earnings growth forecasts rather than the latest loss. It can therefore be helpful to see how that story is laid out in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/twh67x98-update-for-flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Flutter Entertainment Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Unprofitable today, but forecasts point to a turnaround</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Flutter reported revenue of US$16.4b with net income of US$310 million in losses, and consensus forecasts in the data expect the company to become profitable within roughly three years if the projected 42.6% yearly earnings growth plays out.</li> <li>Bears focus on the fact that the business is still loss making, arguing that ongoing spending such as the US$200 million to US$300 million planned for FanDuel Predict in 2026 could hold back margin progress even if revenue keeps growing near the forecast 10.9% rate.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also point to recent impairments, such as the US$556 million non cash charge in India referenced in the cautious narrative, as an example of how regulatory decisions can quickly affect earnings and capital allocation.</li> <li>Set against this, the TTM loss of US$310 million is smaller than the US$950 million loss shown for the TTM period ending Q3 2024, which suggests some progress, but it does not remove the bearish concern that profitability is still a work in progress.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that as long as Flutter is loss making on a trailing basis, every new investment and regulatory change matters for the pace of any future turnaround. The cautious narrative is therefore worth reading alongside the bullish one. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ud99uacb-update-for-flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Flutter Entertainment Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap: low P/S versus DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>With the shares at US$106.14, the data shows Flutter trading on a P/S of about 1.1x compared with roughly 1.7x for US hospitality peers, while a DCF fair value of US$383.49 and an analyst price target of US$253.30 indicate that models and targets sit well above the current market price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view see this mix of a lower P/S multiple and a DCF fair value that is far above the share price as a sign of potential upside. By contrast, the bearish narrative stresses that trailing unprofitability and earnings quality concerns mean those valuation gaps are only meaningful if the forecast earnings growth and path to profit actually show up in future reported numbers.\n    <ul> <li>On the reward side, the risks and rewards summary highlights forecast revenue growth slightly ahead of the broader US market at 10.9% and a possible move into profit within three years, which is what underpins both the DCF model and the analyst target of US$253.30.</li> <li>On the risk side, the same summary flags that margins and historical earnings quality are still limited by the current loss making status, so investors weighing the discount to DCF fair value and targets are effectively being asked to judge how comfortable they are with that trade off.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Flutter Entertainment on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If the mix of bullish and cautious views still feels unresolved, now is a good moment to check the data yourself and decide where you stand.

Over the past few quarters the company has seen revenue move from €115.6 million in Q1 2025 to €135.7 million in Q2 and €119.8 million in Q3, while losses excluding extra items shifted from €14.8 million to €6.7 million and €14 million respectively. This gives investors a clearer read on how top line scale is interacting with persistent bottom line pressure.

This sits alongside the current €55.1 million loss on a sizeable €540.6 million revenue base, so optimists focus on the idea that a large existing operation has been slowly reducing its drag on the income statement.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to the pattern of annual loss reduction as a sign the model has been tightening over time, even though the latest trailing twelve month figures still show a loss.</li> <li>At the same time, the fact that revenue is already over half a billion euros while the company remains unprofitable challenges any bullish view that scale alone is enough to flip earnings quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, Azerion's mix of a sizeable revenue base and ongoing losses has led some investors to question how long it could take for that gradual loss reduction to materially change the picture for earnings focused portfolios. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/ENXTAM/AZRN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Azerion Group.</strong></a> <h2>Low 0.2x P/S against sector averages</h2> <ul> <li>The analysis data flags Azerion trading on a P/S of 0.2x, compared with about 2x for the wider European Interactive Media &amp; Services group and 3.6x for peers. This means the market is valuing each euro of Azerion's revenue at a fraction of the level implied for many competitors.</li> <li>Bulls often argue that a low P/S ratio like 0.2x on €540.6 million of trailing revenue leaves room for upside if profitability improves. That view, however, has to be balanced against the fact that Azerion is currently loss making and that the very low multiple suggests investors are already heavily discounting those revenues.\n    <ul> <li>The contrast between a sub 1x P/S and ongoing net income losses of €55.1 million means the valuation gap could be reflecting concern about how efficiently that revenue converts into profit.</li> <li>On the other hand, the size of the discount to industry and peer P/S levels is exactly what bullish investors point to as the potential reward if the income statement eventually lines up more cleanly with the top line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF fair value far above €0.97 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The supplied discounted cash flow model points to a DCF fair value of about €5.52 per share versus the current share price of roughly €0.97. This is a very large gap between the model output and where the stock is actually trading.</li> <li>Supporters of a more optimistic stance see that gap as a key part of the bullish case. At the same time, the fact that Azerion remains unprofitable with a trailing loss of €55.1 million on €540.6 million of revenue is a clear reminder that any DCF output is being applied to a company that still needs to close the distance between its revenue and its costs.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish angle is that if the multi year pattern of around 4% annual loss reduction continues, the current price near €0.97 could already reflect a lot of pessimism compared with the €5.52 DCF fair value figure.</li> <li>The counterpoint is that as long as the income statement shows continuing losses, the market can remain cautious even when model based values point much higher, so the valuation gap and the loss profile have to be weighed together.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The shift from 6% growth to a 9.5% decline tests that view, because:\n    <ul> <li>Rising total restaurants through 2025 shows expansion continuing while like for like sales turn negative, which can dilute average unit volumes if traffic does not keep up.</li> <li>The bullish focus on better margins per store sits against FY 2025 trailing 12 month net losses of US$134.1 million, so the financial impact of newer formats is not yet visible at the consolidated level.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls point to automation and new formats as future growth drivers, but these results show how much has to go right for that thesis to play out. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/kh3sfgjd-emerging-automation-will-drive-healthy-sustainable-dining-trends-6s18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Sweetgreen Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Losses widen to US$49.7 million in Q4</h2> <ul> <li>Net loss in Q4 2025 was US$49.7 million versus US$29.0 million in Q4 2024, and on a trailing 12 month basis losses were US$134.1 million with basic EPS at a loss of US$1.14.</li> <li>Bears focus on rising costs and execution issues, and the numbers give that argument some backing, because:\n    <ul> <li>Across 2025, quarterly net losses moved from US$25.0 million in Q1 to US$23.2 million in Q2, US$36.1 million in Q3 and US$49.7 million in Q4, so the company is not yet showing a clear path toward break even at the income statement level.</li> <li>Forecasts indicating the company remains unprofitable over the next three years, combined with a cash runway of under one year, line up with the cautious view that ongoing investment and higher costs could keep pressure on margins.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are weighing whether these losses are temporary growing pains or something more structural, it helps to see how skeptics frame the downside. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/k6xv619b-rising-costs-and-oversaturation-will-constrain-margins-and-spur-efficiency-kub6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Sweetgreen Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/S around 1x with slower forecast growth</h2> <ul> <li>With trailing 12 month revenue of US$679.5 million and a P/S of 1.0x that sits below peers at 1.3x and the US hospitality average at 1.7x, the market is pricing Sweetgreen at a discount while revenue is forecast to grow at 7.2% a year versus 10.3% for the broader US market.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights reduced losses over five years and a lower P/S multiple, but the current print adds some tension to that view, because:\n    <ul> <li>The five year loss reduction trend of roughly 9.7% a year contrasts with the latest trailing 12 month net loss of US$134.1 million, which has not yet reflected any move toward the industry profit margin of 8.2% that analysts often reference.</li> <li>The current share price of US$5.55 sits below the single allowed analyst price target of US$7.42, so anyone relying on that target has to reconcile the discount P/S and slower forecast growth with the ongoing lack of profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/wiy30epa-analysts-lower-sweetgreen-price-target-amid-executive-changes-and-expansion-announcements\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Sweetgreen on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this all feels mixed, that is exactly why looking at the underlying data yourself matters.

The latest announcements around M&amp;A leadership, debt redemption, and limited bitcoin ETF access do not materially change the near term focus on credit quality and expense discipline, or the risk that CRE and costs could weigh on margins.</p> <p>Among the recent moves, Truist’s decision to redeem US$1,250,000,000 of fixed‑to‑floating senior notes due 2027 is most relevant, because it speaks directly to capital management at a time when investors are watching credit costs, branch related expenses, and the earnings impact of technology and talent spending. How Truist balances these capital decisions with its exposure to commercial real estate and continued investment in its physical network will likely shape sentiment around the stock’s key catalysts.</p> <p>Yet behind Truist’s efforts to fine tune its capital structure, investors should also be aware of the ongoing risk that its sizable commercial real estate exposure and large branch network could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/banks/nyse-tfc/truist-financial/6au6dvhx-tfc-operational-changes-and-discipline-in-profitability-will-drive-future-shareholder-returns\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Truist Financial (it's free!)</a></p><p>Truist Financial's narrative projects $22.5 billion revenue and $6.3 billion earnings by 2028.

This frames a very strong headline earnings story. Over the past few quarters, the company has seen revenue move from US$59.9 million in Q4 2024 to US$77.1 million in Q4 2025, while quarterly EPS shifted from roughly breakeven at US$0.01 to US$1.60, with trailing twelve month net income reaching US$287.2 million.

The trailing revenue line at US$283.1 million gives that story some support, even though part of the earnings jump is flagged as non cash.</li> <li>At the same time, the sharp step up from quarterly net income of US$1.4 million in Q4 2024 to US$210.8 million in Q4 2025 is so extreme that it invites the question of how much is repeatable operating profit versus one off or accounting driven items that bullish investors need to separate out.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some investors see this earnings profile as the start of a stronger long term story, while others are more cautious about how much of it is sustainable.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/hc9reqtw-aging-demographics-and-lupkynis-uptake-will-expand-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Low 6.4x P/E versus high growth backdrop</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 6.4x against a current price of US$13.97, while revenue is described as forecast to grow about 11.7% per year and TTM EPS sits at US$2.14.</li> <li>Bears highlight that even this low multiple may be justified if the quality of those earnings is weaker than it looks and if profits ease back from here:\n    <ul> <li>The risk summary flags that a large portion of earnings is non cash, so the gap between US$287.2 million of TTM net income and the revenue line can challenge the idea that the stock simply looks cheap on headline EPS.</li> <li>Analyst models pointing to roughly 5.1% annual earnings declines over the next three years run against the very strong trailing profit picture, which supports the bearish view that the current 6.4x P/E might already be factoring in some of this pressure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For you as an investor, the tension between a low P/E and earnings forecasts is where a lot of the debate is happening.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/vvbvvgzz-increasing-pricing-pressures-and-limited-pipeline-will-weaken-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>DCF fair value far above current price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value provided is US$41.93 per share versus the current share price of US$13.97, while the only allowed analyst price target reference here is US$16.67, so both reference points sit above where the stock trades today.</li> <li>Consensus narrative views this gap through the lens of both opportunities and risks, and the recent financials give you data for each side:\n    <ul> <li>On the opportunity side, analysts expect revenue to grow 14.1% per year with profit margins moving from 23.3% to 36.6%, and TTM margins are already described as 2.4 percentage points higher than a year ago. This lines up with a story of improving economics.</li> <li>On the risk side, the same consensus flags that earnings are expected to be around US$141.3 million by 2028, well below the current TTM net income of US$287.2 million. This signals that the recent profitability spike is not being treated as a permanent baseline in those models.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>That mix of a higher DCF fair value and more cautious earnings forecasts is why it helps to separate one off strength from what you think Aurinia can produce year in, year out.</p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/vvbvvgzz-increasing-pricing-pressures-and-limited-pipeline-will-weaken-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Aurinia Pharmaceuticals on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With both bullish and bearish cases on the table, this is the moment to review the numbers yourself and move quickly to shape your own view, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-auph/aurinia-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>The big question hanging over Aurinia is whether current earnings, which rely heavily on non cash items and sit above revenue, can really hold over time.</p> <p>If you want ideas where profits and cash flows may be more closely aligned, check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">77 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> right now and compare how those companies handle earnings quality.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That level of “acquisition firepower” directly ties into the company’s long running playbook of buying cash generative aerospace businesses to feed its aftermarket revenue base. It also interacts with leverage risk, because any sizeable dealmaking from this point is likely to be funded, at least in part, through additional borrowing.</p> <p>But while the acquisition story is compelling, investors should also be aware of how TransDigm’s already high leverage and interest costs could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-tdg/transdigm-group/f88hh54b-analysts-adjust-transdigm-group-outlook-amid-aftermarket-strength-and-softer-oem-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on TransDigm Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>TransDigm Group's narrative projects $10.8 billion revenue and $2.5 billion earnings by 2028.

Over recent quarters the company has seen quarterly revenue move in a tight band between US$37.1 million and US$39.4 million, as net income swung from a Q1 loss of US$13.9 million to a Q4 loss of US$2.5 million and funds from operations ranged from a Q1 loss of US$27.5 million to US$18.1 million in Q4. For investors, the picture is one of pressured margins and a thin cushion in the income statement, so a key consideration is whether the current run rate of revenue can eventually support more stable cash generation.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-clpr/clipper-realty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Clipper Realty.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely held narratives about Clipper Realty, and where the data pushes back against those stories.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The sharp Q1 to Q4 FFO move creates tension with that view by showing:\n    <ul> <li>Quarterly FFO in FY 2025 ranged from the US$27.5 million loss in Q1 to positive US$5.9 million in Q2 and US$18.1 million in Q4, which contrasts with the idea of a simple straight line decline.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing 12 month net income at Q4 remains a loss of US$19.9 million, so the bearish argument about weak profitability and capital structure still lines up with the full year picture.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Negative equity and 12.01% yield keep risk high</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing data flag negative shareholders’ equity alongside a 12.01% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings, while the trailing 12 month net loss of US$19.9 million and EPS loss of US$1.38 underline that current income and capital structure remain under pressure.</li> <li>Critics highlight the major risks of a 19.9% annualized earnings decline over five years and weak dividend coverage, and the reported numbers echo that concern by showing:\n    <ul> <li>Losses across all four FY 2025 quarters, from US$13.9 million in Q1 to US$2.5 million in Q4, and trailing 12 month losses that have widened from US$3.98 million at FY 2024 Q4 to US$19.9 million at FY 2025 Q4.</li> <li>With negative equity already in place, those continuing losses are an important signal for investors who are weighing the sustainability of that 12.01% yield against balance sheet resilience.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how other investors balance that high yield against the balance sheet, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CLPR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Clipper Realty.</strong></a> could help frame the trade off in a broader context.\n\n<h2>P/S of 0.3x and DCF fair value flag valuation gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/S of 0.3x compared with 2.4x for peers and 5.2x for the North American Residential REITs industry, and the DCF fair value of US$6.65 versus a market price of US$3.17 implies the stock sits about 52.4% below that cash flow based estimate.</li> <li>More optimistic investors point to this apparent valuation gap as a key part of the bullish case, and the trailing data give them some support but also clear caveats:\n    <ul> <li>The low P/S multiple and the roughly 52.4% discount to the US$6.65 DCF fair value fit the idea that the market is heavily discounting the stock relative to its cash flow estimate.</li> <li>However, the same dataset notes the company is unprofitable with negative equity and a five year earnings decline of 19.9% per year, so anyone leaning on that valuation upside is effectively betting that these reported issues can eventually be addressed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Over the last few quarters the company has seen revenue move between US$2.070 billion and US$2.161 billion, while trailing twelve month net income excluding extra items has shifted from US$479 million in FY 2024 Q4 to US$1.56 billion in FY 2025 Q4.

US$1.6b of net income excluding extra items, with that period also including a very large US$1.5b one off gain that inflates the headline profit story.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that this strong trailing net margin of 18.7% sits alongside a five year EPS trend that has declined about 8.5% a year, which means:\n    <ul> <li>Bulls pointing to current profitability and a DCF fair value of about US$149.45 need to factor in how much of the recent US$1.6b profit is repeatable once the US$1.5b gain is stripped out.</li> <li>At the same time, the bullish view that efficiency programs and portfolio changes can support higher quality earnings is not directly confirmed or disproved by these figures, since the data shows strong recent margins but also weaker multi year EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Have a look at how bullish investors connect these numbers to their long term story for Solventum: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/qd1r9o06-update-for-solventum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Solventum Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Low 8.3x P/E and US$74.20 price versus US$149.45 DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>Solventum trades at about US$74.20 per share on a trailing P/E of 8.3x, compared with a DCF fair value estimate of roughly US$149.45 and peer and industry P/E averages around 33.5x and 30.9x respectively.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view that the stock looks inexpensive on several measures meets some pushback from the fundamentals, because:\n    <ul> <li>The big gap between the current price and DCF fair value is based on earnings that include the US$1.5b one off gain, so any comparison that uses trailing profit is sensitive to that single event.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 1.1% a year and expected earnings growth of 5.32% a year are both below broader US market expectations, which is a different tone from the idea that the business is on a strong structural growth path.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Interest coverage flagged as a major financial risk</h2> <ul> <li>Risk analysis highlights that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, even after a year in which reported earnings grew very sharply and trailing net margin reached 18.7%.</li> <li>Bears argue that this weak interest coverage, together with modest revenue forecasts, could limit how much the company benefits from cost savings and portfolio changes, because:\n    <ul> <li>Even with trailing twelve month net income of about US$1.6b, the fact that interest is still flagged as a major risk suggests a meaningful portion of that profitability is not easily available for debt service once you adjust for the US$1.5b gain.</li> <li>Bearish analysts also expect revenue to fall 1.9% a year and margins to narrow toward 4%, which, if they were to occur, would put even more pressure on interest coverage than the already cautious risk flag implies.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors focus on these pressure points to build a much more cautious case around Solventum's outlook: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/kjfk0l1t-update-for-solventum\" rel=\"noopener

The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis.

Analysts have provided forecasts that feed into a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with Simply Wall St extending the projections further out. Within that framework, projected Free Cash Flow for 2035 is $1,014.98 million, based on a mix of analyst inputs and extrapolated estimates.</p> <p>When all those forecast cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of around $812.41 per share. Versus a recent share price near $597, this suggests the stock is trading at roughly a 26.5% discount to that DCF estimate. On this cash flow based approach, the model result indicates that CACI may be undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CACI International is undervalued by 26.5%.

It reflects both what the market thinks of those earnings today and how it is weighing the risks around them.</p> <p>Higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk usually support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tend to pull a “normal” or “fair” P/E lower. CACI International currently trades on a P/E of about 25.4x. That sits above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x, but below the peer group average of around 28.0x.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for CACI is 27.2x, which is its proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E might be given the company’s earnings characteristics, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This can be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for factors that can differ meaningfully between companies. With the current P/E of 25.4x sitting modestly below the Fair Ratio of 27.2x, the multiple suggests the stock may be undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-caci/caci-international/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1429557d-de3e-47fa-b954-56434f5f9dd9/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>The 11% increase in Range Resources’ quarterly dividend to US$0.10 per share, or US$0.40 annualized, comes right after a year where the company reported higher revenue and net income for 2025 and generated over US$650m in free cash flow. For you as a shareholder, the timing matters because management is pairing the dividend move with a larger buyback authorization and a 10 year gas sales contract to a Midwest power plant, which together point to confidence in future cash generation and demand visibility. The contract ties a slice of production to a single large customer, which can smooth volumes compared with fully spot exposure.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Range Resources Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The long term power-plant contract supports the narrative that regional demand from power and data center loads can underpin Range Resources’ Marcellus-focused gas strategy.</li> <li>The step up in shareholder returns, including the dividend increase and expanded repurchase program, could test the narrative if capital needs for drilling and processing expansions turn out higher than expected.</li> <li>The specific 10 year offtake agreement to a Midwest power plant, and its contract terms, are not fully captured in the broader narrative around LNG exports and data center demand.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0cxwm1v1-rrc-medium-term-demand-from-lng-exports-and-datacenters-will-drive-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Range Resources</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A larger recurring cash dividend reduces flexibility if future drilling or processing costs rise faster than expected.</li> <li>⚠️ Concentration in Appalachia and reliance on power and LNG-linked demand leave Range Resources exposed if regional prices or regulatory conditions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A higher dividend combined with a US$1.5b buyback capacity signals that recent free cash flow levels have given the board confidence in returning capital.</li> <li>🎁 The 10 year gas supply agreement offers long term volume visibility that many peers such as EQT and Chesapeake Energy may not have to the same contract-specific extent.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how the new dividend compares with free cash flow over the next few quarters, especially as Range Resources spends US$650m to US$700m on its 2026 capital program.

Earnings for the past year have been reported as growing 24.2%. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$145.0 million in Q3 2024 to US$165.9 million in Q4 2024, then to US$162.2 million, US$184.8 million, US$198.9 million and finally US$213.6 million through FY 2025. Over the same stretch, basic EPS stepped through US$0.17, US$0.24, US$0.38, US$0.37 and US$0.37 to US$0.36, setting up an earnings season where investors are weighing steady profitability against how durable those margins really are.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Vital Farms.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely shared narratives around Vital Farms’ growth drivers, risks and profit quality.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Vital Farms</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/324f69bb-f700-4940-9dc6-82d2a62f5e2c/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>24.2% earnings growth with margins holding around 8.7%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, Vital Farms generated trailing twelve month net income of US$66.3 million on US$759.4 million of revenue. This works out to an 8.7% net margin compared with 8.8% in the prior year and ties in with the 24.2% earnings growth figure.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights strong brand and pricing power as key supports for earnings, and the current figures partly back that up while also setting some limits:\n    <ul> <li>The 24.2% earnings growth and US$1.49 trailing EPS line up with the idea that Vital Farms has been able to charge premium prices without losing volume. However, the net margin edge of 8.7% versus 8.8% a year earlier shows that profitability is not racing ahead of sales.</li> <li>Consensus points to expanded production and better distribution as drivers for profit. The move from US$576.1 million to US$759.4 million in trailing revenue over the reported periods suggests the company is putting that extra capacity to use, even if margins have stayed roughly flat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Investors who want to see how these margin trends fit into both the bullish and cautious takes on Vital Farms can check the stories other investors are building around the same numbers in more depth: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/VITL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Vital Farms.</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap: 14.9x P/E and DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>On the valuation side, Vital Farms is trading on a trailing P/E of 14.9x, which is below both the 60.5x peer average and the 24.5x US Food industry average. The stock price of US$21.09 also sits well under a DCF fair value figure of about US$476.21.</li> <li>Bullish investors argue that this gap between price and fundamentals points to upside, and the current numbers give that view some clear support with a few caveats:\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 14.9x P/E and 24.2% earnings growth is the kind of setup bulls point to when they say the market may not be fully reflecting growth yet, especially when trailing EPS sits at about US$1.49.</li> <li>At the same time, analysts' price targets in the dataset are capped at US$42.00, which is far below the US$476.21 DCF fair value figure. This means even the optimistic views around the stock are spread across a very wide valuation range.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth forecasts meet high non cash earnings risk</h2> <ul> <li>Looking ahead using the provided figures, analysts expect earnings to grow about 17.05% per year and revenue about 18.3% per year. Current trailing margins sit at 8.7% and reported earnings include a high level of non cash items flagged as an earnings quality risk.</li> <li>Bears focus on that earnings quality concern and rising spending, and the current figures give them material points to work with as a counter to the growth story:\n    <ul> <li>Critics point out that a high proportion of non cash earnings can make profit growth look stronger than cash generation. Even though trailing net income is US$66.3 million, not all of that may reflect underlying cash flow strength.</li> <li>Bears also highlight that heavier capital spending and higher marketing and overhead costs could weigh on future cash generation, which matters if the forecast 17.05% earnings growth and 18.3% revenue growth do not show up in the actual reported numbers to the extent analysts expect.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Vital Farms on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With a mix of clear upside arguments and some real question marks, it is worth looking at the data yourself rather than relying on headlines.

Together, weaker profitability and elevated leverage around 4.2x frame how investors might interpret longer dated debt issuance in the context of acquisition integration and future financial flexibility.</p> <p>Yet for investors, the real risk to watch is how Sunoco’s higher leverage and refinancing activity could affect...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-sun/sunoco/ynvt67cr-acquisitions-and-organic-projects-will-expand-us-fuel-distribution-qfaw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunoco (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunoco's narrative projects $26.7 billion revenue and $1.6 billion earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-sun/sunoco/ynvt67cr-acquisitions-and-organic-projects-will-expand-us-fuel-distribution-qfaw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunoco's forecasts yield a $65.88 fair value</a>, a 3% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-sun/sunoco\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/0a38a216-0d0e-4750-9015-505315bb9a27/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Five members of the Simply Wall St Community place Sunoco’s fair value anywhere from US$32.51 to US$3,444.12, underscoring how far apart individual views can be.
