The latest half-year update, with record output and A$96.3 million in net income, reinforces that story by showing Sand King is not just online, but already repaid and throwing off cash. That materially strengthens the near-term funding case for the proposed ~3 mtpa mill and Waihi open pit restart, and may ease concerns about overreliance on the new debt facility. At the same time, the sharp share price pullback over the past month suggests the market is still focused on execution risk, especially around sustaining margins and converting today’s strong free cash flow into durable returns if gold prices soften.</p> However, one risk around sustaining current margins and cash flows deserves closer attention. \nOra Banda Mining's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/10ee5398-4b96-4b2c-b0ad-b48a665e44bf/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Eleven fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span A$1.11 to about A$4.36 per share, showing wide disagreement on what Ora Banda is worth.

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>For you as an investor, this CEO change sits on top of several moving pieces for Kroger. Greg Foran brings large scale grocery and general merchandise experience from Walmart, which could be relevant as Kroger tightens its cost base, simplifies its structure, and closes underperforming locations. Those are sensitive moves in a low margin business where peers like Walmart, Costco, and Target are also pushing hard on price, private label, and e-commerce. At the same time, Kroger is investing in health focused offerings such as GLP-1 support programs and dietitian services, and continues to face mixed analyst views, including a recent downgrade to Equal Weight and lowered price target. The combination of leadership overhaul, restructuring and varied external opinions means execution and communication from the new CEO may matter more to how you interpret short and medium term developments.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kroger Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Foran’s appointment could support the existing narrative around tighter cost controls, automation, and store footprint review, as he has experience managing large store networks and operational efficiency at scale.</li> <li>Restructuring, store closures, and a leadership change after a board investigation may challenge earlier assumptions that cost optimization and store expansion would progress smoothly without governance or cultural friction.</li> <li>The increased focus on GLP-1 medication programs and broader wellness offerings is only partly reflected in the existing narrative and may add another dimension to Kroger’s health focused positioning over time.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/blqx7z7z-e-commerce-expansion-and-health-focus-will-strengthen-future-szdj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kroger</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Leadership turnover following a board investigation introduces uncertainty around culture, retention, and the pace of operational changes.</li> <li>⚠️ Store closures, restructuring, and heavy investment in digital and supply chain projects could pressure margins and free cash flow if benefits take longer than expected.</li> <li>🎁 Foran’s large format retail and grocery background may help align store portfolio, pricing, and operations with what has worked at other scale retailers.</li> <li>🎁 Kroger’s push into health and wellness services, including GLP-1 support, provides an additional way to differentiate versus competitors while using existing pharmacy and food infrastructure.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how quickly the new CEO sets out a clear plan for Kroger’s store footprint, cost base, and digital priorities, and whether that plan stays consistent through the upcoming earnings cycle.

The latest US$775.67 million equity raise via a forward sale slots directly into that story: it helps fund the planned US$38.00 billion of grid and clean‑energy infrastructure spending while also easing pressure on an already leveraged balance sheet. In the near term, that likely means the key catalysts remain regulatory decisions, execution on capital projects and continued dividend progression, while the main trade‑off is incremental dilution for existing shareholders. With the shares recently trading a little above consensus fair value and analysts broadly neutral, the offering itself does not look like a thesis‑changing event, but it does sharpen focus on funding costs, outage performance and future rate outcomes.</p> However, investors should be aware of how repeated equity raises could affect long term returns.\n\nConsolidated Edison's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/721aa817-6bdd-4ca3-aa2e-3117a6b10b23/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates cluster tightly around US$105 to US$108, hinting at limited perceived mispricing.

Over the last six reported quarters, revenue has moved in a tight band between US$611.1 million and US$642.5 million while quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$0.05 to a high of US$1.00, reflecting shifting earnings power that puts the focus firmly on how durable its margins really are.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Globant.</a> <p>With the latest figures on the table, the next step is to see how these margins and earnings trends line up with the most widely discussed narratives around Globant’s growth and risk profile, and where the numbers push back on those stories.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Globant</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:GLOB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/25169e8c-4bb6-4a30-aa44-565362b099c5/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:GLOB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 4.2% Net Level</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Globant converted US$2.5b of revenue into US$102.9 million of net income excluding extra items, which works out to a 4.2% net margin versus 6.9% a year earlier.</li> <li>Bears highlight the margin squeeze as a core concern, and the trailing numbers give them some support:\n    <ul> <li>The Q2 2025 quarter even showed a small loss, with net income excluding extra items of US$2.4 million on US$614.2 million of revenue. This lines up with worries about earnings sensitivity when growth slows.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue stayed close to US$2.5b. The drop from a 6.9% to 4.2% net margin is therefore more about profitability than demand collapsing, which is exactly the pressure point bears focus on rather than a volume shock.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Globant's thinner 4.2% net margin and that Q2 loss are exactly the kind of numbers bears point to when they argue the business model is under pressure. It is worth seeing how that squares with a full Bear Case view in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/uppr7toe-ai-and-geopolitical-risks-will-limit-demand-yet-offer-hope-havg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Globant Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>One Off US$73.3m Loss Clouds Earnings Trend</h2> <ul> <li>The last 12 months included a one off loss of US$73.3 million, which weighed on the reported net income of US$102.9 million and on the 4.2% net margin figure investors are looking at today.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this large item masks the underlying earnings power, and the data gives them some talking points:\n    <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, three of the four quarters were profitable on a net income excluding extra items basis, adding up to US$102.9 million despite the drag from the one off. Bulls see this as more reflective of the ongoing run rate than the headline margin alone.</li> <li>Analysts in the bullish camp also point to forecast earnings growth of about 21.6% per year from this base, so they treat the US$73.3 million charge as a temporary hit rather than a permanent change in the business model that would keep margins at 4.2%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see that US$73.3 million one off charge as a speed bump rather than a reset of long term profitability, which is a key pillar of the Bull Case set out in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1hiaw3fa-ai-and-cloud-native-solutions-will-transform-global-work-models-zxut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Globant Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E Of 21.3x And DCF Fair Value Gap</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$49.76, Globant trades on a P/E of 21.3x, slightly above the 18.2x peer average and roughly in line with the US IT industry at 21x, while the supplied DCF fair value of US$101.78 sits well above the current price.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about a mixed risk and reward setup, and the current numbers show why views are split:\n    <ul> <li>On one side, the DCF fair value of US$101.78 implies a large gap to the share price. This lines up with the idea that the market may be underpricing the 21.6% forecast earnings growth even though revenue is only expected to grow about 4.7% per year.</li> <li>On the other, the higher than peer P/E together with a trailing net margin of 4.2% means today’s valuation is being asked to sit on top of relatively modest profitability. This is exactly what more cautious investors focus on when they question how much of that growth is already reflected in the multiple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Globant on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious signals leaves you on the fence, act while the data is fresh and weigh it against your own expectations, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Globant’s thinner 4.2% net margin, a recent quarterly loss and a one off US$73.3 million charge all raise questions about the consistency of its earnings power.</p> <p>If you are uneasy about paying up for that kind of earnings volatility, it is worth checking our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">76 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> to focus on companies with more stable profiles right now.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $1.08b. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations suggest free cash flow reaching around $1.92b in 2035, with interim projections such as $1.17b in 2026 and $1.39b in 2028. These figures are all expressed in US$ and include both analyst inputs and Simply Wall St extrapolations beyond the typical five year analyst window.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $577 per share, compared with a current share price of roughly $681. That implies the stock is about 18.0% above this particular fair value estimate, based on this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Teledyne Technologies may be overvalued by 18.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 47 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Teledyne Technologies.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Teledyne Technologies Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Teledyne Technologies, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for the stock to the earnings the business is currently generating. In general, higher growth expectations or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower, more conservative multiple.</p> <p>Teledyne’s current P/E is about 35.25x, compared with the Electronic industry average of around 27.59x and a peer average of roughly 60.93x. To give a more tailored view, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 24.68x for Teledyne, which is the P/E level it might trade on given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more useful than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it is specific to Teledyne’s own mix of growth, risks and profitability. Relative to that Fair Ratio of 24.68x, the current P/E of 35.25x is higher by a clear margin, suggesting the shares are pricing in richer terms than this model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$26 million in Q4 2024 through US$33 million and negative US$43 million in early 2024 to US$21 million, US$15 million, then US$13 million in 2025. Quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$5.33 in Q2 2024 to losses of US$1.28, US$0.14 and US$1.01 across 2025, setting up a story where investors are likely to focus on how efficiently MBIA is managing its shrinking top line against persistent losses and what that implies for margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for MBIA.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to weigh them against the most widely held narratives around MBIA, to see which stories the latest results support and which ones the data starts to challenge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/4it2jeai-update-for-mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about MBIA</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e7562be9-1d4c-489e-b33b-f5446fff2d04/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Running losses still large at US$175 million TTM</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, MBIA reported total revenue of US$80 million and a net loss from ongoing operations of US$175 million, which works out to basic EPS of US$3.55 in losses.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about earnings reaching US$58.3 million by around 2028 with margins moving from about 188.2% in the red to 64.6% in the black, and the current loss profile sets up a clear test of that path:\n    <ul> <li>The last four reported quarters still show losses in each period, including US$50 million in Q4 2025 and US$62 million in Q1 2025, so any future profit story has to bridge that gap.</li> <li>At the same time, the data shows losses shrinking at about 4.2% per year over five years. This is consistent with a gradual improvement but still far from the earnings level implied in those longer term forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue growth vs flat outlook</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, revenue growth is described at about 8.4% per year. Yet quarterly revenue in the table runs from US$33 million in Q3 2024 to US$13 million in Q4 2025, while analysts assume revenue of US$90.4 million by 2028 that is characterized as fairly flat over the next three years.</li> <li>What is interesting for the bullish narrative is how that 8.4% revenue growth rate lines up with assumptions that revenue stays fairly flat, even as bulls expect higher margins to carry future earnings:\n    <ul> <li>The consensus narrative ties a lot of the potential upside to margin improvement rather than big new premium growth. This fits with comments about the insured portfolio running off and limiting future revenue expansion.</li> <li>Given that the insured par at National is described as shrinking and leverage sits at 23 to 1, bulls are effectively leaning on cost control and better outcomes on legacy exposures rather than a jump in top line to support those margin targets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how those margin assumptions stack up against MBIA's latest numbers, have a look at <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MBIA Bull Case</strong></a> for the full bull case.\n\n<h2>Premium P/S, mixed valuation signals</h2> <ul> <li>MBIA trades on a P/S of 4.1x compared with about 1.2x for the wider US insurance group and roughly 1.0x for peers. A DCF fair value of about US$34.47 in the supplied data sits well above the current share price of US$6.55 and the analyst price target of US$7.75.</li> <li>Bears focus on that valuation gap by pointing out that the premium P/S multiple is coming alongside negative shareholders' equity and ongoing losses, which leaves little room for disappointment if forecasts do not play out as expected:\n    <ul> <li>The company is still unprofitable on a trailing 12 month basis and has negative equity flagged in the risk summary, so the balance sheet is not yet reflecting the DCF fair value figure or the US$58.3 million earnings level assumed for 2028.</li> <li>With the analyst price target only about 18% above the current US$6.55 share price, skeptics can argue that the market is already cautious, even as the DCF fair value number suggests a much larger gap that depends heavily on that future profit recovery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical about whether those losses and balance sheet issues justify a premium P/S?

This article is designed to help you frame that question clearly.</li> <li>The stock closed at US$108.33, with a 1.8% decline over the last 7 days, a 17.4% gain over 30 days, a 30.1% return year to date, a 20.5% return over 1 year, a 120.6% return over 3 years and a 273.5% return over 5 years. This gives important context before weighing up valuation.</li> <li>Recent coverage has focused on Iron Mountain's positioning as a real estate and data focused business, alongside ongoing interest in how traditional storage assets and data center exposure fit together for long term investors. These themes help explain why the share price performance over multiple time frames is drawing attention from investors who care about both income and growth potential.</li> <li>On our checks, Iron Mountain scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, which you can see in more detail in its <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation score</a>.

For Iron Mountain, this version of the DCF uses adjusted funds from operations as a proxy for free cash flow to equity.</p> <p>The model starts from Iron Mountain’s last twelve months free cash flow of about $1.54b, then uses analyst estimates for the next few years and extends them out to 2035. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $2.49b, with intermediate annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are either based on analyst forecasts or extrapolated estimates by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows results in an estimated intrinsic value of about $155.76 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$108.33, the model implies the stock trades at a 30.4% discount.

It is especially handy when earnings can be affected by non cash items or accounting choices, while sales remain a cleaner top line measure.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/S ratio depends on how quickly investors expect sales to grow and how much risk they see in those expectations. Higher perceived growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tends to line up with a lower ratio.</p> <p>Iron Mountain currently trades on a P/S ratio of 4.64x. That sits below the Specialized REITs industry average of 7.56x and below the peer group average of 7.32x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for Iron Mountain is 5.32x, which estimates the P/S level that fits its earnings profile, industry, profit margin, size and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or industry averages because it folds in those company specific factors. With the current 4.64x P/S sitting below the 5.32x Fair Ratio, Iron Mountain appears undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This shows how two investors looking at the same business, from legacy storage risk on one side to information infrastructure opportunity on the other, can reach very different yet clearly framed views.</p> <p>For Iron Mountain, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Iron Mountain Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/xn8xw1oo-legacy-data-management-with-optionality-in-digital-and-infrastructure-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iron Mountain Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 32.3% below the narrative fair value based on the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: very large, reflecting a multi fold increase from the current base</p> <ul> <li>Frames Iron Mountain as a global information management REIT with deep exposure to regulated sectors like healthcare, financial services and government, where compliance needs and high switching costs support long contracts.</li> <li>Sees the combination of sticky physical storage and expanding digital and data center services as a hybrid model, with legacy assets supplying cash and newer offerings adding optionality and new revenue pillars.</li> <li>Argues that as customers upgrade infrastructure and refine data governance, Iron Mountain’s focus on secure colocation, digital transformation and lifecycle management can support meaningful growth in information infrastructure services.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/a5ubyqkq-falling-legacy-demand-will-burden-data-center-margins-1jbl?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iron Mountain Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$65.53</p> <p>Implied downside to this fair value: 38.4% below the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 9.19%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights the risk that faster cloud adoption and digital transformation reduce demand for legacy physical storage, while tougher competition and higher costs in data centers pressure margins.</li> <li>Points to ongoing capital needs, sustainability requirements and potential commoditization in data centers as factors that could strain free cash flow, leverage and pricing power over time.</li> <li>Bases its lower fair value on analyst assumptions for mid single digit revenue growth, higher future profit margins and a lower future P/E, arguing that current market expectations may already be demanding.</li> </ul> <p>If seeing both sides laid out like this helps you clarify your own view, the next step is to go straight to the full narratives, compare the assumptions with your expectations for Iron Mountain and decide which story feels closer to how you think the business can perform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Iron Mountain? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/IRM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over the past few quarters, revenue has moved within a range from US$762.74 million in Q2 2025 to US$807.74 million in Q1 2025, while quarterly EPS has shifted between US$1.35 and US$1.76 over that span. This sets up a trailing twelve month revenue base of about US$3.2 billion and EPS of US$5.63.

However, the FY 2025 data also shows some offsets:\n    <ul> <li>Average production cost over the trailing 12 months sits at US$11.73 per BOE, with Q4 at US$10.86, so unit costs are not running out of control even as margins eased.</li> <li>Total oil equivalent production over the last year reached 75.5 MMboe, compared with 62.4 MMboe in the earlier 12 month period provided, which gives some volume support against the bearish concern that weaker demand will immediately feed through to lower earnings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> SM Energy's margin slippage gives skeptics plenty to talk about, and they argue it could be the early sign of a tougher profitability cycle.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Flutter Entertainment (NYSE:FLUT) closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$4.7b and a basic EPS loss of US$0.05, alongside trailing twelve month revenue of US$16.4b and a TTM basic EPS loss of US$1.75. Over the past four reported quarters, revenue has ranged from US$3.7b to US$4.7b, while quarterly basic EPS has swung between a profit of US$1.59 and a loss of US$3.92. This sets up a mixed backdrop for a business that is still loss making on a TTM basis but is being assessed on strong earnings growth forecasts. Overall, the latest numbers keep the spotlight squarely on how quickly Flutter can tighten margins and move its TTM EPS closer to breakeven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Flutter Entertainment.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the table, the next step is to set these results against the widely followed narratives around Flutter's growth, profitability path, and risk profile to see which views are supported by the numbers and which ones get pushed back.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Flutter Entertainment</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb59a032-5d0c-48c8-83f7-3e6b451467f1/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Revenue climbs to US$4.7b, but profits still swing around</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly revenue moved between US$3.7b and US$4.7b, yet net income ranged from a profit of US$283 million in Q1 to a loss of US$690 million in Q3, showing that earnings are still quite sensitive even at higher sales levels.</li> <li>Bulls point to forecast revenue growth of about 10.9% a year and expected earnings growth of 42.6% a year as signs that this volatility could settle into a clearer path to profit, but the latest trailing 12 month loss of US$310 million keeps the bullish case tied to future execution rather than current profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters highlight that losses have been reduced over the past five years at around 2.9% a year, while revenue has reached US$16.4b on a trailing 12 month basis.</li> <li>At the same time, a TTM basic EPS loss of US$1.75 shows that, for now, the bullish view leans heavily on those forward growth assumptions rather than on the most recent earnings line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that these swings are the growing pains of a business building scale, and they focus on the earnings growth forecasts rather than the latest loss. It can therefore be helpful to see how that story is laid out in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/twh67x98-update-for-flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Flutter Entertainment Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Unprofitable today, but forecasts point to a turnaround</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Flutter reported revenue of US$16.4b with net income of US$310 million in losses, and consensus forecasts in the data expect the company to become profitable within roughly three years if the projected 42.6% yearly earnings growth plays out.</li> <li>Bears focus on the fact that the business is still loss making, arguing that ongoing spending such as the US$200 million to US$300 million planned for FanDuel Predict in 2026 could hold back margin progress even if revenue keeps growing near the forecast 10.9% rate.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also point to recent impairments, such as the US$556 million non cash charge in India referenced in the cautious narrative, as an example of how regulatory decisions can quickly affect earnings and capital allocation.</li> <li>Set against this, the TTM loss of US$310 million is smaller than the US$950 million loss shown for the TTM period ending Q3 2024, which suggests some progress, but it does not remove the bearish concern that profitability is still a work in progress.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that as long as Flutter is loss making on a trailing basis, every new investment and regulatory change matters for the pace of any future turnaround. The cautious narrative is therefore worth reading alongside the bullish one. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ud99uacb-update-for-flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Flutter Entertainment Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap: low P/S versus DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>With the shares at US$106.14, the data shows Flutter trading on a P/S of about 1.1x compared with roughly 1.7x for US hospitality peers, while a DCF fair value of US$383.49 and an analyst price target of US$253.30 indicate that models and targets sit well above the current market price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view see this mix of a lower P/S multiple and a DCF fair value that is far above the share price as a sign of potential upside. By contrast, the bearish narrative stresses that trailing unprofitability and earnings quality concerns mean those valuation gaps are only meaningful if the forecast earnings growth and path to profit actually show up in future reported numbers.\n    <ul> <li>On the reward side, the risks and rewards summary highlights forecast revenue growth slightly ahead of the broader US market at 10.9% and a possible move into profit within three years, which is what underpins both the DCF model and the analyst target of US$253.30.</li> <li>On the risk side, the same summary flags that margins and historical earnings quality are still limited by the current loss making status, so investors weighing the discount to DCF fair value and targets are effectively being asked to judge how comfortable they are with that trade off.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Flutter Entertainment on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If the mix of bullish and cautious views still feels unresolved, now is a good moment to check the data yourself and decide where you stand.
