            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Kyocera (TSE:6971) has attracted fresh interest after its shares showed strong momentum over the past three months, returning nearly 12%. Recent trading activity has highlighted changing investor sentiment around the company’s valuation.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Kyocera.</a></p> <p>This comes on the back of a notable year for Kyocera, with momentum picking up as the share price returned nearly 12% over the past three months and a robust 31.7% gain year-to-date. Total shareholder return has also been strong, up 39.6% in the past year and 60.7% over five years. This suggests both short-term and long-term performance has remained impressive amid shifting sentiment and renewed optimism about the company’s growth potential.</p> <p>If you’re watching Kyocera’s rally and wondering what else is gathering steam right now, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Kyocera’s impressive momentum drawing attention, the real question now is whether the share price still offers upside, or if the market has already factored in the company’s future growth prospects. This could leave little room for new buyers.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 115.8x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Kyocera’s stock currently trades at a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 115.8, which stands far above both the electronic industry average and its closest peers. With a recent close of ¥2,046.5, this rich valuation signals that the market is pricing in highly optimistic future growth or discounting short-term profit volatility.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio is a widely used metric to gauge how much investors are paying for each unit of earnings. For technology companies like Kyocera, a high P/E can sometimes reflect strong growth expectations or confidence that earnings will rebound sharply after a cyclical dip.</p> <p>However, Kyocera’s P/E of 115.8 is much higher than the Japanese electronic industry average of 15.2 and the peer average of 35.7, highlighting a significant premium that may not be justified by current profitability levels. The fair price-to-earnings ratio is estimated at 27.5, which indicates the current market price reflects much higher expectations than what typical models suggest the company deserves. If sentiment shifts or earnings growth underdelivers, this multiple may revert closer to industry norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kyocera</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 115.8 (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, any slowdown in earnings growth or a market correction in tech valuations could quickly challenge the bullish outlook for Kyocera’s shares.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Kyocera narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Points to Undervaluation</h2> <p>While Kyocera’s share price looks expensive using the price-to-earnings ratio, our DCF model presents a different story.

Before this announcement, Duni was paying out 72% of earnings, but a comparatively small 70% of free cash flows.  In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.   </p><p> Looking forward, earnings per share could rise by 53.0% over the next year if the trend from the last few years continues.   Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-durables/sto-duni/duni-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874708-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761914103560\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:DUNI Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-durables/sto-duni/duni-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Duni </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years.      The annual payment during the last 10 years was SEK4.50 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was SEK5.00.      This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.1% over that duration.     Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.    </p> <h2>The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow</h2> <p> Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future.      We are encouraged to see that Duni has grown earnings per share at 53% per year over the past five years.      However, Duni isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we wonder how quickly it will be able to grow in the future.   </p> <h2>We Really Like Duni's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Duni might even raise payments in the future.       Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash.       Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.   </p><p> It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.  Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

This aligns with the forecasted climb from 7.9% to 10.8%.</li> <li>It is notable that expected margin gains come even as revenue growth projections lag the US market average. This suggests operational upgrades, rather than top-line growth, are driving profitability.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative contends that efficiency efforts will offset moderate revenue growth to boost margins, but the forecasted margin still lags peers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector.\n    <ul> <li>While sector averages are not explicitly quoted for future margins, industry comparisons show L3Harris’s current 7.9% margin is lower than some peers. This indicates there is still catch-up potential or risk if targets are missed.</li> <li>With most of the expansion tied to internal projects rather than external demand, achieving the 10.8% margin depends heavily on actual execution of the LHX NeXt cost optimization strategy.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Upbeat earnings forecasts have analysts expecting $2.7 billion in profit by September 2028, but the low end of estimates is just $2.0 billion, signaling ongoing debate around the durability of this growth.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/xtgeqwhm-analyst-upgrades-drive-higher-price-targets-for-l3harris-amid-sector-momentum-and-new-defense-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full L3Harris Technologies Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2>Valuation at a Discount to Industry Peers</h2> <ul> <li>L3Harris trades at a Price-To-Earnings ratio of 32.6x, lower than both the peer median of 75x and the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 38.9x.\n    <ul> <li>This discount is paired with a current share price of $295.90, which stands below the analyst price target of $325.78 and the DCF fair value of $348.93. This could potentially offer upside if consensus estimates hold true.</li> <li>The relatively modest revenue growth expectation of 5.4% per year sets a conservative tone, but forward valuation may look attractive if margin expansion and earnings growth materialize as projected.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that despite slower growth and some execution risks, the current valuation reflects both a safety margin against slower uptake and the upside if L3Harris closes the gap to peers.\n    <ul> <li>The market appears to price in the minor financial position risk, but also offers room for reward should efficiency and partnerships pay off.</li> <li>If L3Harris outperforms on margin gains or international demand, the valuation gap to the DCF fair value of $348.93 may shrink further.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Count Set to Decline</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts expect shares outstanding to fall by 1.36% per year over the next three years, signaling capital allocation towards buybacks and potentially delivering higher EPS than topline growth alone would suggest.\n    <ul> <li>The share count reduction augments the forecasted 14.6% per year EPS growth, compounding earnings per share even if overall profit growth trails some sector peers.</li> <li>This aligns with the consensus view that L3Harris will rely on financial management and efficiency, as opposed to just revenue growth, to deliver shareholder value.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that this strategy is not without risk, as sustained buybacks depend on cash generation, and future government budget constraints could challenge both capital returns and overall growth targets.\n    <ul> <li>Reliance on buybacks amplifies the impact of any unexpected earnings shortfalls or cost overruns, raising the bar for operational discipline in the coming years.</li> <li>Continued execution on forecasted reductions in share count is a key component of the analyst valuation case and will be closely watched for delivery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/xtgeqwhm-analyst-upgrades-drive-higher-price-targets-for-l3harris-amid-sector-momentum-and-new-defense-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for L3Harris Technologies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Interpret the results another way?

However, AcadeMedia's earnings easily cover the dividend.  This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.   </p><p> Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 52.3%.   Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-services/sto-acad/academedia-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/36827615-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761914298163\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:ACAD Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-services/sto-acad/academedia-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for AcadeMedia </a></span></p> <h2>AcadeMedia Doesn't Have A Long Payment History</h2> <p> The dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 6 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions.      Since 2019, the dividend has gone from SEK1.25 total annually to SEK2.25.      This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time.     AcadeMedia has been growing its dividend quite rapidly, which is exciting. However, the short payment history makes us question whether this performance will persist across a full market cycle.    </p> <h2>The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow</h2> <p> The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time.     AcadeMedia has impressed us by growing EPS at 15% per year over the past five years.      Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.   </p> <h2>AcadeMedia Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock</h2> <p> Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year.       Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash.       All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.   </p><p> Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Long term investing works well, but it doesn't always work for each individual stock.  We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone.  Anyone who held <strong>Sabre Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-sabr/sabre\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:SABR</a>) for five years would be nursing their metaphorical wounds since the share price dropped 75% in that time.    We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 40%.     Furthermore, it's down 35% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.      </p><p> Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> Sabre isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing.  Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip.  That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.  </p><p> Over five years, Sabre grew its revenue at 14% per year.   That's a fairly respectable growth rate.   So the stock price fall of 12% per year seems pretty steep.  The truth is that the growth might be below expectations, and investors are probably worried about the continual losses.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-sabr/sabre/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/254517933-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761914304191\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:SABR Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Take a more thorough look at Sabre's financial health with this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-sabr/sabre/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report on its balance sheet</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Sabre shareholders are down 40% for the year, but the market itself is up 21%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 12% over the last half decade.  We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.        I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.   Even so, be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-sabr/sabre\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Sabre is showing <strong> 2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong> </a>, and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...    </p><p> If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16951/undervalued-small-caps-with-insider-buying\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Merus (MRUS) has seen impressive momentum this year, with shares climbing over 120% year-to-date. Recent performance has caught the eye of many investors, especially as biotech valuations continue to draw attention across the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mrus/merus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Merus.</a></p> <p>This surge in Merus’s share price is part of a months-long rally fueled by growing optimism around its clinical pipeline and positive sector momentum. Momentum is clearly building, with a year-to-date share price return of nearly 125% and five-year total shareholder return topping 650%, which represents a remarkable long-term trajectory by any measure.</p> <p>Inspired by this kind of sustained growth? It could be worth checking out other innovative biotech names in our healthcare stock screener: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_healthcare_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>After such extraordinary gains, investors are left wondering whether Merus’s stock is still trading at an attractive price or if the recent momentum means the market is already pricing in all future upside potential.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Book Ratio of 8.6x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>With Merus trading at a price-to-book ratio of 8.6x and the last close price at $95.06, investors may question whether such a premium is warranted, especially since it stands well above the typical sector range.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of company net assets and is a widely used benchmark for biotech firms, which often operate without steady profits. For Merus, this high multiple signals that the market is attaching significant value to its future growth potential rather than current profitability or net asset base.</p> <p>Compared to the US biotechs industry average of 2.5x, Merus’s ratio is notably rich. This suggests that either the company is commanding a justified premium based on anticipated revenue growth, or enthusiasm is running well ahead of fundamentals. Peer averages indicate where the market could eventually migrate if sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mrus/merus/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 8.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks such as slower than expected revenue growth or clinical setbacks could quickly challenge the bullish outlook surrounding Merus’s recent rally.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mrus/merus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Merus narrative.</a></p> <h2> Build Your Own Merus Narrative</h2> <p>If you want to take a hands-on approach, you can explore the latest Merus data and build your own investment view in just a few minutes. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative\" href=\"https://support.simplywall.st/hc/en-us/articles/10353275550479-Stock-Valuator-with-Narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Do it your way</a>.</p> <p>A great starting point for your Merus research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mrus/merus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a> that could impact your investment decision.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>Give yourself the edge by seeking out the most promising stocks today, not after everyone else is already talking about them.

            "title": "Assessing Panasonic After 38% Price Surge and New EV Battery Partnerships in 2025",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Panasonic Holdings is a smart buy right now? Let's dig into what the numbers and the market are really saying about the company's true worth.</li> <li>After climbing 14.1% over the past month and up an impressive 38.0% for the last year, Panasonic's share price has caught more eyes, which could potentially signal new growth optimism or shifting risk expectations.</li> <li>Driving these moves are recent headlines around Panasonic’s expanding EV battery partnerships and renewed momentum in green tech. Investors are considering whether these trends could boost earnings and long-term relevance. Other updates highlight the company’s strategic push in North America and new investments in smart home and industrial automation technologies.</li> <li>On the raw numbers alone, Panasonic Holdings scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> for undervaluation, suggesting the shares look attractively priced by most common metrics. But before jumping to conclusions, we will break down the different valuation approaches and at the end, provide a better framework for judging if Panasonic delivers real long-term value.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_industry_underperformer\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out why Panasonic Holdings's 38.0% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Panasonic Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p> A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to today's value. This process gives investors an idea of what the business is truly worth in the present.\n</p> <p> For Panasonic Holdings, the latest figures show that current Free Cash Flow (FCF) is approximately ¥98.3 billion. Analyst projections and Simply Wall St extrapolations suggest this could rise to around ¥620 billion by 2030, indicating significant growth expectations. In the first five years, analyst consensus informs the FCF outlook, while later years are based on modeled growth rates beyond the window of analyst certainty.\n</p> <p> All numbers are in Japanese yen. The DCF analysis arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of ¥4,189 per share. Comparing this to the current trading price implies the stock is about 56.9% undervalued, suggesting a strong margin of safety for potential investors.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Panasonic Holdings is undervalued by 56.9%.

It helps investors understand how much they are paying for each yen of current earnings. The PE ratio typically rises for businesses with higher growth expectations and lower perceived risks, while it sits lower for companies facing headwinds or cyclical challenges.\n</p> <p> Panasonic Holdings currently trades at a PE ratio of 11.5x, just below the Consumer Durables industry average of 11.6x. However, compared with its peer group, which features an average PE of 31.4x, Panasonic appears much more conservatively valued. These benchmarks provide useful context, but they do not capture the full picture of a company's unique strengths, risks, or growth trajectory.\n</p> <p> That is where Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio comes into play. The Fair Ratio, calculated here at 24.7x, factors in Panasonic’s earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, risk profile, and its industry placement. This approach goes well beyond a surface-level comparison to peers or industry averages. Since Panasonic’s actual PE ratio is well below its Fair Ratio, this suggests that the shares may be attractively priced for long-term investors seeking value.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6752 PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2649ef90-d9c3-488d-95af-4660ebb4ea56/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6752 PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1394 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Panasonic Holdings Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your unique view or story about Panasonic Holdings, bringing together your assumptions about its future revenue, earnings, and margins into a single, logical forecast for what the company is worth.\n</p> <p> Instead of just relying on industry multiples or static price targets, Narratives let you connect the company's business story to a tailored financial forecast, producing your own personal estimate of fair value. With Simply Wall St's Community, millions of investors can publish Narratives, making it easy for anyone to explore or contribute forecasts based on changing news or market developments. All of this can be done in just a few clicks.\n</p> <p> Narratives are dynamic and constantly updated as new information arrives, empowering you to make more timely decisions. For example, some investors believe Panasonic’s innovations in energy storage and cost control will drive earnings above ¥580 billion by 2028, supporting a fair value over ¥2,500 per share. Others see policy risks and execution challenges limiting future profits to ¥375 billion, setting fair value closer to ¥1,500. Narratives help you compare these views side by side, so you can decide which story and price best fit your own perspective.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Panasonic Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-6752/panasonic-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6752 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2649ef90-d9c3-488d-95af-4660ebb4ea56/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6752 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Revenue is projected to increase at 5.9% per year, which trails the broader Hong Kong market’s 8.7% pace, while profit margins dipped slightly from 2% to 1.9% year over year.

Net profit margin improved to 14%, up from 12.5% in the previous year, reflecting a clear boost in profitability. With earnings forecast to grow 7.17% per year and revenue at 3.4% per year, both slower than the broader Hong Kong market, investors are focused on how the company's undervalued share price and strong margins shape its investment case.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/media/hkg-811/xinhua-winshare-publishing-and-media-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Xinhua Winshare Publishing and Media.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these headline results compare with the broader narratives investors and analysts have built around Xinhua Winshare Publishing and Media.

This highlights a wide valuation gap.</li> <li>Rather than just reflecting weak growth, the prevailing view is that this low valuation could be driven by a mix of steady earnings quality and investor caution around the company's slower revenue and earnings growth forecasts compared to the broader Hong Kong market.\n    <ul> <li>Peers are growing faster. Revenue and earnings in the Hong Kong market are forecast at 8.7% and 12.4% annually, about double or more than Xinhua Winshare's pace.</li> <li>Despite this, Xinhua Winshare's high-quality earnings and margin improvements offer a buffer. This supports the case that the deep discount may represent overlooked value rather than just risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Profit Margins Hit 14% Milestone</h2> <ul> <li>Net profit margin climbed to 14%, up from 12.5% in the prior year. This marks a continued improvement in overall profitability even as topline growth slows.</li> <li>The prevailing perspective pushes back against concerns about the company’s ability to defend its margins amid lackluster revenue growth, arguing:\n    <ul> <li>Cost management and operational resilience are driving margin gains, which are notable even in a sector facing digital disruption.</li> <li>This margin foundation strongly supports Xinhua Winshare's reputation for high-quality earnings, a rare consistency among listed media peers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Towers Above Share Price</h2> <ul> <li>The stock currently trades at HK$10.42, well below the DCF fair value estimate of HK$50.73. This suggests investors are applying a steep discount relative to long-term cash flow prospects.</li> <li>While sector momentum benefits digital-first companies, the prevailing view is that Xinhua Winshare's discount could signal undervaluation if the company continues to translate its strong margins into sustainable growth, even at a slower pace than the market.\n    <ul> <li>The combination of rising profitability and a share price well under fair value creates tension for investors deciding whether the market is overlooking stable, high-quality earnings.</li> <li>Valuation support is further reinforced by the absence of material risks outside the caution flagged on dividend sustainability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to undergo a reversal of fortunes, which has elevated the P/S ratio.  If not, then existing shareholders may be very nervous about the viability of the share price.     </p> If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-psnl/personalis/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Personalis</a>. <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/S?  </h2><p> Personalis' P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the industry.  </p><p> Taking a look back first, we see that there was hardly any revenue growth to speak of for the company over the past year.   Fortunately, a few good years before that means that it was still able to grow revenue by 5.1% in total over the last three years.  So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing revenue over that time.   </p> <p> Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 26%  per annum as estimated by the eight analysts watching the company.  With the industry only predicted to deliver 7.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger revenue result. </p><p> With this in mind, it's not hard to understand why Personalis' P/S is high relative to its industry peers.  It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.  </p> <h2> What Does Personalis' P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Shares in Personalis have seen a strong upwards swing lately, which has really helped boost its P/S figure.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of Personalis' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior revenue outlook is contributing to its high P/S.  Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/S as they are quite confident future revenues aren't under threat.  It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-psnl/personalis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for Personalis</strong> </a> (1 can't be ignored) you should be aware of.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets</strong>.

The recent profit guidance cut points directly to these regions as ongoing short-term challenges, putting pressure on the main recovery catalyst while spotlighting market risks that may continue to weigh on revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future.\n</p> <p> One recent announcement relevant to these ongoing risks was the reduction in dividend payments set in July 2025, which reflects management’s response to lower profit expectations and the need to conserve cash. This aligns with cautious measures aimed at protecting the company’s financial stability during a period of weak demand in China and the U.S., reinforcing the importance of prudent cash and risk management as operating conditions shift.\n</p> <p> However, with competitive pricing and slowed Cognac market recovery in the U.S., investors should be aware that...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fr/food-beverage-tobacco/epa-rco/remy-cointreau-shares/5q6fz44w-rco-expanding-us-and-china-investments-will-support-business-recovery-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Rémy Cointreau (it's free!)</a></p><p>Rémy Cointreau's outlook anticipates €1.1 billion in revenue and €146.2 million in earnings by 2028.

If realized, this would mark a dramatic recovery from current lows.</li> <li> According to analysts' consensus view, several trends drive this optimism: \n    <ul> <li>Digital sales are increasing, with web sales up 8.4% in Q2, alongside new investments in omnichannel and digital marketing efficiency.</li> <li>Supply chain shifts to reduce China exposure and grow partnerships in Vietnam are meant to boost gross margins and stabilize profit, highlighting a proactive approach to future disruptions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Despite Growth Forecasts</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of $21.65, Haverty trades well below both its DCF fair value of $60.94 and the consensus analyst target of $29.00. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2x is a deep discount to peer averages at 34.9x.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus narrative emphasizes this rare combination:\n    <ul> <li>Storm clouds from weak housing and macro headwinds have not derailed a forecast of 7.2% annual revenue growth or the expectation for earnings to climb from $19.6 million to $107.4 million by 2028, showing potential for long-term upside.</li> <li>Sustained focus on brand loyalty and deeper market penetration in the southern U.S. is expected to drive long-term demand, while a discount to DCF fair value and peer multiples provides an added margin of safety for new investors entering at today’s price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Even analysts who take a wait-and-see approach acknowledge the substantial gap between the current price and projected value, suggesting plenty of room for sentiment to shift if the fundamentals play out as forecast. <strong>📈 Read the full Haverty Furniture Companies Consensus Narrative.</strong></p> <h2>Dividend and Cost Pressures Remain Manageable</h2> <ul> <li>Despite some flagged risks around dividend sustainability and higher SG&amp;A costs, no major risks were highlighted, and there is no evidence of significant recent insider selling.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus view highlights that persistent cost pressures, such as rising advertising and occupancy costs, are in focus. However, operational improvements via supply chain diversification and expanding store footprint are expected to offset much of this, with only minor risk to the company’s ability to deliver forecasted earnings growth.\n    <ul> <li>The company's plan to grow physical presence in high-potential southern U.S. markets aims to leverage fixed costs and capture market share, potentially enhancing long-term earnings durability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ns9p7qtj-us-housing-trends-will-fuel-omnichannel-and-supply-chain-shifts-wl7v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Haverty Furniture Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Looking at the data from a fresh angle?

The latest guidance for Q4, featuring substantially reduced EBITDA estimates and a clear acknowledgment of ongoing softness in demand, has put the spotlight on Olin’s ability to deliver tangible margin improvements, while the main short-term catalyst remains successful execution on cost reduction, and the biggest risk continues to be a prolonged global oversupply and weak pricing environment in chlor-alkali and vinyls. The recent update does not materially change these fundamental drivers, but elevates scrutiny of operational execution through what management warns is seasonally the weakest quarter.</p> <p>Among the latest company actions, Olin announced the repurchase of 500,000 shares for US$10.1 million during the third quarter, finalizing just over 21% of the buyback program launched in mid-2022. This ongoing share repurchase effort is important as it signals confidence in capital return even as near-term earnings headwinds remain a concern for investors tracking progress on both catalysts and risks.</p> <p>Yet unlike the market’s initial focus on low EDC prices, investors should also be aware of the risks posed by ongoing high inventories and weak demand in the Winchester ammunition segment...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-oln/olin/9ns8vr59-analyst-commentary-reflects-cautious-optimism-as-olin-faces-mixed-signals-and-modest-valuation-gains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Olin (it's free!)</a></p><p>Olin's outlook anticipates $7.4 billion in revenue and $375.3 million in earnings by 2028.
