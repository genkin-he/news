The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis. In the very near term, the key catalyst is the upcoming Q4 2025 earnings release, while the biggest risk remains a sharp correction in charter rates if trade routes normalize or demand softens.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement to this dividend is the declared timetable for Q4 2025 results on March 5, 2026, which now lands just one day before the payout date. That puts the dividend, capital return story, and fresh earnings data right next to each other on the calendar, potentially sharpening investor focus on how effectively Global Ship Lease is turning its contracted backlog and recent fleet additions into sustainable free cash flow and ongoing shareholder distributions.</p> <p>But against this backdrop, investors should also be aware of the risk that tighter environmental rules could force costly upgrades or early scrapping of older ships...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-gsl/global-ship-lease/foinmbvw-midsize-container-ships-will-improve-efficiency-despite-market-headwinds-fx8t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Global Ship Lease (it's free!)</a></p><p>Global Ship Lease's narrative projects $621.0 million revenue and $270.6 million earnings by 2028.

An ESOP related shelf registration is directly related to that discussion, since equity based incentives can be a key part of how healthcare providers seek to retain and motivate staff. For shareholders, the filing is a structural update that sits alongside broader industry attention on workforce stability and care quality.</p> <p>For investors, key considerations include how much stock might eventually be issued under this shelf, over what timeframe, and on what terms employees gain access. The filing establishes a framework rather than an immediate transaction, so the specifics of future issuances, potential dilution, and any capital raising that may be associated with ESOP funding could be important to monitor as PACS Group develops this plan.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-pacs/pacs-group/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PACS Group</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the recent turnaround can point to Q2 to Q4 basic EPS between roughly US$1.01 and US$2.19 as evidence that profitability has held above early 2024 levels in recent quarters.</li> <li>The longer term decline in earnings growth rate, despite the strong trailing 12 month print, shows the bullish story is relying heavily on the latest year rather than a multi year pattern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong recent profits sit next to a weaker multi year track record, and that tension is exactly what many investors are trying to weigh up right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/INVA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Innoviva.</strong></a></p> <h2>One off gain inflates 65.9% margin</h2> <ul> <li>The reported 65.9% trailing net profit margin is much higher than the 6.5% margin a year earlier, and the data attributes a US$161.6 million one off gain as a key factor, so a large slice of the margin is tied to a single item rather than repeatable operations.</li> <li>Critics highlight that the very large year over year earnings improvement, described as more than a tenfold jump, is hard to treat as a new normal when:\n    <ul> <li>The one off gain of US$161.6 million fed directly into the trailing 12 month net income of US$271.2 million, which means a material portion of that profit is non recurring.</li> <li>The same data set shows analysts expecting earnings to decline by about 0.8% per year over the next three years, so the bearish view is that the spike in margins does not line up with the more muted outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>“Cheap” 6.5x P/E versus 19.9x industry</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$23.54, the trailing P/E of 6.5x sits well below both the reported US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.9x and a peer average of 17.7x, while the DCF fair value cited for Innoviva is US$53.96, which is much higher than the current price.</li> <li>What is interesting for the more cautious, bearish narrative is that this discount exists alongside softer longer term earnings trends and forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Earnings across the last five years declined at about 22.1% per year, even though the most recent trailing 12 month period shows very strong profit, so the low P/E is being judged on a high earnings base that includes a large one off gain.</li> <li>Revenue is forecast to grow at 9.5% per year, slightly below the 10.4% reference rate for the US market, which bears use to argue that the apparent valuation gap may be partly explained by more modest growth expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are weighing that low 6.5x P/E against the earnings record and forecasts, the community discussion is a helpful next step. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

However, the 90-day share price return shows a 5.09% decline, which contrasts with a 1-year total shareholder return of 142.68%.

Yet the market is assigning a premium that suggests investors are heavily focused on future growth potential and the aPAP opportunity rather than today’s financials.</p> <p>That premium also stands out against peers. Savara’s 15.6x P/B is described as expensive versus both the US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x and a peer average of 12.1x, implying the market is paying a significantly richer multiple than is typical for the space.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 15.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the risk that the company remains loss making, with net income of $115.645m in the red and no current revenue base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Savara narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>With sentiment clearly split between the risks and the potential upside, it makes sense to act now and review the numbers for yourself, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If you are serious about sharpening your watchlist, do not stop at one stock story, use the Simply Wall St screener to uncover ideas you might otherwise miss.</p> <ul> <li>Spot potential value opportunities early by scanning companies on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> list that pair quality fundamentals with prices that may not fully reflect them.</li> <li>Strengthen your defensive side by reviewing companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> that score well on stability and downside protection.</li> <li>Get ahead of the crowd by checking the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undiscovered_gems\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473622/high-quality-undiscovered-gems/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">screener containing 24 high quality undiscovered gems</a> where strong fundamentals have yet to attract broad attention.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That 28.3% earnings growth compares to a 5 year compound rate of 3.3%.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this kind of earnings acceleration supports a stronger long term story, yet the data creates a mixed picture:\n    <ul> <li>The 28.3% trailing earnings growth and higher 2.5% margin line up with the bullish view that better efficiency and mix can support higher profitability over time.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus and bullish scenarios are still only assuming earnings growth in the low to mid single digits each year, which is much closer to the older 3.3% 5 year trend than to the most recent year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, that gap between the one year surge and the slower 5 year pace is exactly what bullish investors are debating in their forecasts for Ahold Delhaize, and it is unpacked further in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/nzlb4xbk-demographic-shifts-and-digital-expansion-will-create-lasting-value-sdn5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Steady quarterly EPS with same store sales around 3%</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly EPS stayed in a tight band between €0.60 and €0.65 while reported same store sales growth was 3.3% in Q1, 4.0% in Q2, 2.9% in Q3 and 3.2% on a trailing twelve month basis.</li> <li>Bears point out that this kind of mid single digit same store sales and stable EPS ties in with their concern about limited top line momentum:\n    <ul> <li>Forecasts for revenue growth of about 2.3% a year and earnings growth of about 4.4% a year are not far from what this same store sales range suggests and are slower than the Dutch market forecasts of 9.6% for revenue and 12.4% for earnings.</li> <li>This helps the bearish side argue that even with stable quarterly EPS today, future growth may be constrained by mature markets and rising competition in areas like online grocery and discount formats.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who see those growth forecasts as a ceiling rather than a floor are building their case around this slower profile, and you can see that laid out clearly in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/89uf5o5x-digital-competition-will-erode-market-share-and-raise-costs-6h5d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation gap and slower growth vs Dutch market</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 16.4x versus a peer average of 28.1x and an industry average of 18.8x.

Over recent reporting periods, the company has seen revenue move from €1.53b in H2 2024 to €1.56b in H1 2025 and €1.53b in H2 2025, while basic EPS shifted from €0.27 in H2 2024 to €1.10 in H1 2025 and €0.26 in H2 2025, giving investors a clear read on how margins and earnings are tracking.

Recent results highlight a strong rebound, while still leaving the longer multi year weakness very visible.\n    <ul> <li>Bears often focus on that 46.7% annual decline in earnings over five years as a sign of pressure on the business, and that signal is clearly present in the data.</li> <li>At the same time, the step up in net income to US$180.1 million over the last 12 months shows that, at least recently, profitability has been materially stronger than the prior year despite that long run decline.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Base Above US$1.1b</h2> <ul> <li>Zimplats has generated US$1.1b of trailing twelve month revenue, compared with recent half year revenue points of US$350.2 million in H1 2025, US$394.3 million in H2 2024 and US$476.4 million in H2 2025, so investors can now see performance over a larger revenue base than any single half.</li> <li>For investors leaning toward a more bullish stance, the combination of a US$1.1b revenue base and 16.1% net margin strongly supports the idea that the current earnings profile is being earned on sizeable sales rather than just a one off shift.\n    <ul> <li>The move in half year revenue from US$394.3 million in H2 2024 to US$476.4 million in H2 2025 provides context for how the business reached the US$1.1b trailing revenue level.</li> <li>TTM net income of US$180.1 million set against that US$1.1b revenue shows that each dollar of sales has recently been converting into profit at a much higher rate than the earlier 2.8% margin period.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Zimplats has shifted from low margins on a smaller revenue base to a 16.1% margin on US$1.1b of revenue. This is exactly the kind of pivot bullish investors often look for in earnings stories. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/ASX/ZIM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Zimplats Holdings.</strong></a> <h2>P/E of 8.9x Versus Industry 23.1x</h2> <ul> <li>At the current share price of A$20.90, Zimplats trades on a trailing P/E of 8.9x, sitting below the Australian Metals &amp; Mining industry average of 23.1x, below the peer average of 22.2x and below the broader Australian market on 20.4x.</li> <li>What is interesting for valuation focused bulls is that this lower 8.9x P/E sits alongside the recent 16.1% net margin and US$180.1 million of trailing net income, which heavily supports the bullish claim that the shares are priced below many peers on past earnings even after a very large rebound in profitability.\n    <ul> <li>The gap between 8.9x and the 23.1x industry average suggests the market is applying a clear discount to Zimplats relative to other metals and mining names using trailing earnings.</li> <li>Given the multi year 46.7% annual earnings decline, that discount can also be read as the market weighing the risk of those weaker years against the recent improvement, which is a key tension for both bullish and bearish investors to consider.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The latest twelve month free cash flow figure is about $1.62b. Analysts provide explicit estimates for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to build a 10 year path of cash flows.</p> <p>On this basis, projected free cash flow for 2030 is $2.27b, with interim annual figures between 2026 and 2035 ranging from roughly $1.55b to $2.92b before discounting. After bringing all those future amounts back to today at an appropriate discount rate, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$108.17 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of US$86.44, this DCF output implies the stock is about 20.1% undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ventas is undervalued by 20.1%.

Higher expected growth or a business model seen as lower risk often comes with a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can justify a lower one.</p> <p>Ventas currently trades on a P/S of 7.06x. This sits very close to the Health Care REITs industry average of 7.04x and slightly below the peer group average of 7.78x, so on a simple comparison, the stock does not look extreme either way.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Ventas is 5.92x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/S might be reasonable once you factor in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it blends these company characteristics, it can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 5.92x with the current 7.06x P/S suggests Ventas shares are trading above that fair level.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-vtr/ventas/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VTR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/dd658e0b-e85f-4fb9-96db-bc84ffa2ae83/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VTR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Ventas into a simple story that ties your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast. They map that forecast into a Fair Value you can compare with the current share price to decide whether you see it as an opportunity or something to avoid right now. They then keep that view fresh by updating automatically on Simply Wall St’s Community page when new earnings or news arrive. For example, one investor might build a Narrative around analyst assumptions that Ventas could reach $6.9b in revenue and $443.6m in earnings by about 2028 with a future P/E of 91.1x and conclude that a Fair Value around US$89.50 is reasonable. Another investor might focus on risks like competition, acquisition execution and labor costs and choose more cautious forecasts and a lower Fair Value. This gives you two clear stories and two different ways to act on the same stock.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ventas? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/VTR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-vtr/ventas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/dd658e0b-e85f-4fb9-96db-bc84ffa2ae83/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Its 1 year total shareholder return of 54.65% and very large 5 year total shareholder return of 167.74% point to momentum that recent AI and data center moves may be influencing as investors weigh growth potential against execution risks.</p> <p>If this AI partnership has you thinking more broadly about the theme, it could be a good time to scan a curated list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential ideas to research next.</p> <p>With a 54.65% 1 year total return, a very large 5 year gain and an estimated 30.85% intrinsic discount, is Singtel still offering value after its AI pivot, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred P/E of 12.3x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a P/E of 12.3x at a last close of S$5.04, Singapore Telecommunications screens as undervalued compared to its peers and the wider Asian telecom group. That gap will catch the eye of investors who care about what they are paying for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much investors are currently paying for the company’s earnings, and it is a common way to compare telecom operators that share similar capital intensity and business models. A lower P/E can suggest the market is applying a discount to those earnings, which sometimes reflects concerns about future profit trends or the quality of recent results.</p> <p>Here, the 12.3x P/E stands well below both the Asian telecom industry average of 17x and the peer average of 45.6x, which is a steep gap. It also sits below the estimated fair P/E of 17.3x that our models suggest the market could gravitate toward over time, based on how similar companies are priced.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/sg/telecom/sgx-z74/singapore-telecommunications-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Singapore Telecommunications</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 12.3x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, there are still clear risks, including weaker annual net income growth of 17.8% and the execution burden of scaling AI, data center and digital services together.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/sg/telecom/sgx-z74/singapore-telecommunications-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Singapore Telecommunications narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF also points to a discount</h2> <p>Price based on earnings is only one lens.

The company has seen quarterly revenue range from €466.0 million to €694.0 million across 2025, with net income moving between €13.0 million and €69.5 million.

data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>27.5% earnings growth with 7.8% margin</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing twelve month basis, Fluidra earned €176.0 million on €2.2b of revenue, which works out to a 7.8% net margin and 27.5% earnings growth over the past year compared with the earlier 6.4% margin.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about aftermarket strength and a €100 million cost simplification program supporting higher margins, and the data partly backs that up but also shows limits:\n    <ul> <li>Year to date, management has highlighted a 24% adjusted EBITDA margin and higher gross margin than 2024, which lines up with the move from a 6.4% to 7.8% net margin.</li> <li>At the same time, revenue growth referenced at about 4.7% a year is only slightly ahead of recent trailing trends, so the margin story is doing more of the heavy lifting than the top line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly swings behind the full year</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, quarterly revenue moved between €466.0 million and €694.0 million, while quarterly net income ranged from €13.0 million to €69.5 million, showing that the annual 7.8% margin is built on very different seasonal quarters.</li> <li>Bears argue that dependence on pricing, aftermarket demand and longer commercial project cycles could pressure volumes and margins, and the quarterly pattern highlights why they care about that:\n    <ul> <li>Q2 2025, with €694.0 million of revenue and €69.5 million of net income, sits well above Q3’s €466.0 million revenue and €27.5 million net income, which leaves less room if pricing or project timing turn less favorable.</li> <li>Bears also point to higher exposure to commercial pool projects and ongoing spending on digitalization and M&amp;A, so any quarter that looks closer to Q4’s €13.0 million net income would quickly test how resilient that cost base really is.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how more cautious investors frame those swings against their longer term assumptions, check out the full bear-case breakdown for Fluidra: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/dhyl3ma4-update-for-fluidra\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Fluidra Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Premium P/E with high debt</h2> <ul> <li>Fluidra trades on a P/E of 24.5x versus peers at 17.8x and the wider European Machinery industry at 21.1x, while a DCF fair value of €30.46 sits above the current €22.68 share price and the business is flagged for high debt and an unstable dividend record.</li> <li>That mix of a premium P/E and DCF gap is at the heart of the more optimistic narrative, and the numbers cut both ways for bulls:\n    <ul> <li>The 27.5% trailing earnings growth and margin move to 7.8% support the bullish view that the current €22.68 price could be below DCF fair value of €30.46 if those trends are repeatable.</li> <li>On the other hand, the premium 24.5x P/E versus the 17.8x peer average, slower expected revenue growth of about 4.7% compared with a 5.8% Spanish market forecast, and the flagged high debt position all give investors concrete reasons to question how much of that DCF upside they want to pay for today.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that premium P/E against the margin and earnings profile, it helps to see how bullish investors connect the dots across cycles in one place: <a

Book value is $13.78 per share and the stable earnings per share are estimated at $1.92, based on weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 12 analysts. The average Return on Equity used in the model is 12.18%, while the cost of equity is $1.13 per share, leaving an excess return of $0.79 per share.</p> <p>The model also uses a stable book value of $15.78 per share, again sourced from weighted future book value estimates from 12 analysts. Combining these with the Excess Returns framework produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $37.01 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $17.54, this Excess Returns valuation implies the stock is 52.6% undervalued based on these assumptions and inputs.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Huntington Bancshares is undervalued by 52.6%.

It ties the share price directly to the earnings stream that ultimately supports dividends and retained capital.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E usually reflects what investors expect for future growth and how much risk they see in those earnings. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth or greater uncertainty often points to a lower multiple.</p> <p>Huntington Bancshares currently trades on a P/E of 17.06x. That is above the Banks industry average of 11.75x and also above the peer group average of 13.23x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Huntington Bancshares is 16.67x, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E could be given factors such as earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and key risks.</p> <p>Compared with simple peer or industry comparisons, the Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored because it adjusts for those company specific drivers rather than assuming all banks deserve the same multiple. With the actual P/E of 17.06x sitting modestly above the Fair Ratio of 16.67x, the shares screen as slightly expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-hban/huntington-bancshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HBAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fc00b70e-27c3-4226-b098-c7e01a84dee7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HBAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you attach a clear story to your numbers by linking your view of Huntington Bancshares' future revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast and then to a fair value. This updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive and gives you an easy way to compare that fair value to the current price. For example, one Narrative on the Community page currently anchors on a fair value of US$10.11 with relatively modest growth assumptions, while another uses a fair value of US$20.50 with stronger revenue growth and higher profit margins. This shows how two investors looking at the same bank can use different Narratives to decide whether the current price around the high teens looks closer to an opportunity or something to watch.</p> <p>For Huntington Bancshares however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Huntington Bancshares Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/banks/nasdaq-hban/huntington-bancshares/kwqtp1w8-hban-cadence-bank-acquisition-will-drive-southeast-and-texas-market-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Huntington Bancshares Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bull case Narrative: US$20.50 per share</p> <p>Implied valuation gap: about 14.4% undervalued versus the recent US$17.54 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 18.98% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on expansion into higher population growth regions like Texas and the Carolinas, with acquisitions and organic growth increasing fee income and loan opportunities.</li> <li>Assumes continued progress in digital banking, payments, and efficiency initiatives, which support non interest income, margins, and operating leverage.</li> <li>Builds in analyst expectations for revenue and earnings growth through to 2028, with a P/E multiple above the current US Banks industry average, and treats the current share price as close to fairly priced against the consensus target.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/banks/nasdaq-hban/huntington-bancshares/7lloaipr-overvalued-hban?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Huntington Bancshares Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bear case Narrative: US$10.11 per share</p> <p>Implied valuation gap: about 73.4% overvalued versus the recent US$17.54 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 1%</p> <ul> <li>Points to a fair value that sits well below the current share price, with a future P/E ratio of 11x and modest revenue growth assumptions.</li> <li>Highlights that analyst targets cluster around an upper teens share price with only moderate expected upside from prior levels, while current pricing already reflects much of that view.</li> <li>Frames Huntington Bancshares as only modestly attractive for value focused investors under this set of assumptions, given the relatively low growth outlook used in the model.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how these Narratives are built, you can use them as a starting point, then tweak the revenue growth, margins, and required return until the story lines up with your own expectations for Huntington Bancshares.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Over recent quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from €793.4 million in Q4 2024 to €760.1 million in Q1 2025, €746.9 million in Q2 2025, €752.4 million in Q3 2025 and €773.1 million in Q4 2025.

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Squeezed by One Off €78.4m Hit</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Nomad Foods earned €136.7m of net income on about €3.0b of revenue, but that includes a one off loss of €78.4m and a move in net margin from 7.3% to 4.5%.</li> <li>Bears argue that repeated guidance cuts and reliance on cost cutting point to fragile profitability, and the reported one off loss and lower margin give that view some backing, although:\n    <ul> <li>Trailing net income of €136.7m is still positive, which sits against bearish worries that earnings could be at risk if cost pressures persist.</li> <li>The 4.5% margin, while lower than 7.3%, is being weighed down by that €78.4m item, so part of the pressure the bearish narrative focuses on is tied to a specific event rather than the entire ongoing cost base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> A lot of cautious investors point to these compressed margins as a red flag, so if you want to see how that concern plays out over different scenarios, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/wy9jtppy-revenue-challenges-will-weigh-on-frozen-sectors-though-margins-improve\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Nomad Foods Bear Case</strong></a> to see how skeptics frame the longer term risks.\n\n<h2>Interest Coverage Weakens Even With TTM Profit</h2> <ul> <li>Interest coverage is flagged as weak, meaning current earnings do not comfortably cover interest payments, even though trailing 12 month net income stands at €136.7m and EPS at €0.91.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about cost savings and future margin improvement, but the interest coverage issue is an important counterpoint because:\n    <ul> <li>Lower net margin at 4.5% leaves less room to absorb financing costs, which is exactly what critics highlight when they point to financial vulnerability.</li> <li>The presence of that large €78.4m loss in the same period makes it harder to tell yet whether future margins will be strong enough to comfortably improve coverage, so the optimistic margin story still has to be proven against the current figures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E Of 10.2x Versus DCF Value And Targets</h2> <ul> <li>Nomad Foods trades on a trailing P/E of 10.2x at a share price of US$11.26, which is below the US food industry average of 24.5x and peer average of 21x, and also below a DCF fair value of about US$28.48 and an allowed analyst price target reference of US$16.95.</li> <li>Bulls point to product development and efficiency programs as support for higher future earnings, and the current valuation gap feeds into that case because:\n    <ul> <li>The difference between the share price of US$11.26 and the DCF fair value of about US$28.48 suggests the market price sits well under that cash flow based estimate, which bullish investors see as room for upside if earnings forecasts play out.</li> <li>Forecast earnings growth of around 27.3% per year cited in the analysis is much stronger than the 0.3% annual revenue growth over the last year, so bulls are effectively arguing that profit improvement, not recent top line trends, will be the main driver of value.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to weigh that gap between today’s low P/E and the more optimistic fair value arguments, the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"
