Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$315m and statutory earnings per share of US$1.45.     Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual.  We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-pb/prosperity-bancshares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/393970-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761996481358\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:PB Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Prosperity Bancshares from 13 analysts is for revenues of US$1.49b in 2026. If met, it would imply a major 20% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.       Per-share earnings are expected to rise 8.4% to US$6.08.        Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$1.51b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.26 in 2026.        So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-pb/prosperity-bancshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Prosperity Bancshares </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target held steady at US$78.67, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.        That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets.  There are some variant perceptions on Prosperity Bancshares, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$85.00 and the most bearish at US$70.00 per share.   With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.    </p> <p> Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates.     It's clear from the latest estimates that Prosperity Bancshares' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 16% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 1.1% p.a. over the past five years.    Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 8.1% annually.  It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Prosperity Bancshares to grow faster than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Prosperity Bancshares.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   We have forecasts for Prosperity Bancshares going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-pb/prosperity-bancshares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> Before you take the next step you should know about the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-pb/prosperity-bancshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Prosperity Bancshares</strong></a> that we have uncovered.  </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for.   Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think <strong>MasterCraft Boat Holdings</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-mcft/mastercraft-boat-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:MCFT</a>) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

To calculate this metric for MasterCraft Boat Holdings, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.058 = US$11m ÷ (US$260m - US$65m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>MasterCraft Boat Holdings has an ROCE of 5.8%. </strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Leisure industry average of 8.7%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-mcft/mastercraft-boat-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for MasterCraft Boat Holdings </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-mcft/mastercraft-boat-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/214080574-roce-1-dark-2/1762000819942\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGM:MCFT Return on Capital Employed November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for MasterCraft Boat Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

Over the last  five years, returns on capital have decreased to 5.8% from 20%  five years ago.    Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning.   If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> In summary, we're somewhat concerned by MasterCraft Boat Holdings' diminishing returns on increasing amounts of capital.       Long term shareholders who've owned the stock over the last  five years have experienced a 12% depreciation in their investment, so it appears the market might not like these trends either.   That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-mcft/mastercraft-boat-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with MasterCraft Boat Holdings </a>and understanding it should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While MasterCraft Boat Holdings may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 92%, which means that Associated Banc-Corp would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.    </p><p> Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 121.0% over the next 3 years.   Analyst estimates also show the future payout ratio being 32% in the same 3 years which brings it into quite a comfortable range.      </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-asb/associated-banc-corp/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/251884-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1762000867627\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:ASB Historic Dividend November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-asb/associated-banc-corp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Associated Banc-Corp </a></span></p> <h2>Associated Banc-Corp Has A Solid Track Record</h2> <p> The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation.      Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.96.      This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.1% per annum over that time.     Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.    </p> <h2>The Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential</h2> <p> Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history.   However, things aren't all that rosy.      Associated Banc-Corp's earnings per share has shrunk at 12% a year over the past five years.  Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future.   It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.    </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Associated Banc-Corp's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Associated Banc-Corp will make a great income stock.       We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio.      We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.  </p><p> Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The numbers show that in the last  five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 7.8%.  Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 60% more capital is being employed now too.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p><h2> In Conclusion... </h2><p> All in all, it's terrific to see that FLEX LNG is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base.       And a remarkable 566% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down.   For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed.   Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed. </p><p> Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether <strong>Corvus Pharmaceuticals</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:CRVS</a>) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn.   In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'.  We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Long Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Runway? </h2><p> You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash.   As at June 2025, Corvus Pharmaceuticals had cash of US$74m and no debt.   Importantly, its cash burn was US$29m over the trailing twelve months.   Therefore, from June 2025 it had 2.6 years of cash runway.    Importantly,  analysts think  that Corvus Pharmaceuticals will reach cashflow breakeven in 4 years.   That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly, it may well look to raise more cash.    The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/279359732-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762002107107\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGM:CRVS Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Corvus Pharmaceuticals </a></span></p> <h2> How Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Burn Changing Over Time? </h2><p> Because Corvus Pharmaceuticals isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business.  Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation.     With the cash burn rate up 36% in the last year, it seems that the company is ratcheting up investment in the business over time.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway.    Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our analyst forecasts for the company</a>. </p> <h2> How Easily Can Corvus Pharmaceuticals Raise Cash? </h2><p> While Corvus Pharmaceuticals does have a solid cash runway, its cash burn trajectory may have some shareholders thinking ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash.    Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business.  Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth.  By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate). </p><p> Since it has a market capitalisation of US$578m, Corvus Pharmaceuticals' US$29m in cash burn equates to about 5.0% of its market value.    That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.  </p><h2> How Risky Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Burn Situation? </h2><p> It may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way Corvus Pharmaceuticals is burning through its cash.  For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path.   Although its increasing cash burn does give us reason for pause, the other metrics we discussed in this article form a positive picture overall.     One real positive is that  analysts are forecasting  that the company will reach breakeven.    After taking into account the various metrics mentioned in this report, we're pretty comfortable with how the company is spending its cash, as it seems on track to meet its needs over the medium term.

After a year of improving profitability and strong revenue growth, the company’s headline third-quarter revenue surge and positive mazdutide Phase 3 data have injected real momentum into its short-term outlook. These confirm that Innovent’s expansion beyond oncology, especially in the high-growth metabolic disease segment, may now be a key catalyst, and the faster-than-market revenue growth forecast could become more credible. However, bigger rewards come with complex risks, for Innovent, the steep price-to-earnings ratio and relatively low return on equity stand out, as does the risk of execution as new therapies reach a commercial inflection. The Takeda partnership may reduce some development risks but global execution remains untested. \nOn the flipside, keep an eye on market expectations around profitability as valuation pressure can shift quickly.</p> Innovent Biologics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 16%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/hkg-1801/innovent-biologics-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/hkg-1801/innovent-biologics-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:1801 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/861d28ed-8790-450c-b7ce-2b5bca5b0e07/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:1801 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s three fair value estimates for Innovent Biologics range widely from HK$36.45 up to HK$109.21 per share.

The appointment of Karthik Suri as Chief Product and Corporate Strategy Officer is a meaningful move, but any impact on short-term catalysts, particularly stabilizing customer retention among top accounts, may not be immediately visible.

The P/S ratio is probably low because investors think this poor revenue performance isn't going to get any better.  If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price.    </p> Keen to find out how analysts think Largo's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-lgo/largo-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report is a great place to start</a>. <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should far underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Largo's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> In reviewing the last year of financials, we were disheartened to see the company's revenues fell to the tune of 32%.   This means it has also seen a slide in revenue over the longer-term as revenue is down 53% in total over the last three years.  Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been undesirable for the company.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 30% during the coming year according to the only analyst following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 80% growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this information, we can see why Largo is trading at a P/S lower than the industry.  It seems most investors are expecting to see limited future growth and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> What Does Largo's P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Largo's P/S looks about as weak as its stock price lately.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of Largo's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior revenue outlook is contributing to its low P/S.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/S as they concede future revenue probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-lgo/largo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>4 warning signs for Largo</strong></a> (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets</strong>.

That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 8.1% in total.  So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.   </p> <p> Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 11%  each year as estimated by the two analysts watching the company.  With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth  per year, that's a disappointing outcome. </p><p> With this information, we are not surprised that Otter Tail is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. </p><p> We've established that Otter Tail maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Plus, you should also learn about these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-ottr/otter-tail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs we've spotted with Otter Tail</strong></a> (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant).  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a low P/E. </a> </p></div>",

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.52 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.24.      This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.1% a year over that time.     Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.    </p> <h2>First Community Bankshares Could Grow Its Dividend</h2> <p> The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time.     We are encouraged to see that First Community Bankshares has grown earnings per share at 6.5% per year over the past five years.       Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.    </p> <h2>In Summary</h2> <p> Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.       While First Community Bankshares is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Perhaps the market is expecting the current trend of poor revenue growth to continue, which has kept the P/S suppressed.  If you still like the company, you'd be hoping revenue doesn't get any worse and that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour.     </p> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company?

Still, lamentably revenue has fallen 10% in aggregate from three years ago, which is disappointing.  So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 2.5% over the next year.  Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 37%, which is noticeably more attractive. </p><p> With this in consideration, its clear as to why Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S is falling short industry peers.  Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S? </h2><p> While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> As expected, our analysis of Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Oshkosh Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:OSK</a>) shares in the week since its quarterly report, with the stock down 12% to US$123.       Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$2.7b, statutory earnings were in line with expectations, at US$3.04 per share.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/294167-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1762001295097\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:OSK Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Oshkosh's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$11.0b in 2026. This reflects an okay 6.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 18% to US$12.38.        Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$11.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.50 in 2026.        The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Oshkosh </a></span></p> <p> The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$150, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations.        That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets.  There are some variant perceptions on Oshkosh, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$185 and the most bearish at US$119 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Oshkosh shareholders.    </p> <p> Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/industrials/machinery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates.     We would highlight that Oshkosh's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 9.8% p.a. growth over the last five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.4% annually.  Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Oshkosh is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates.        Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Oshkosh. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple Oshkosh analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Oshkosh </a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p></div>",

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 31% in total over the last three years.  Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 15% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> With this information, we can see why Neo-Concept International Group Holdings is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Neo-Concept International Group Holdings' P/E? </h2><p> Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Neo-Concept International Group Holdings maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks.

MGP Ingredients is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business.  In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.   </p><p> According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year.   If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 22%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-mgpi/mgp-ingredients/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/288133-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1762001450868\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:MGPI Historic Dividend November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-mgpi/mgp-ingredients\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for MGP Ingredients </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past.      Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $0.05 total annually to $0.48.      This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25% a year over that time.     Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.    </p> <h2>Dividend Growth Potential Is Shaky</h2> <p> With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future.      MGP Ingredients' EPS has fallen by approximately 12% per year during the past five years.  This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future.   On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.    </p> <h2>MGP Ingredients' Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable</h2> <p> Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year.       The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>Limbach Holdings</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:LMB</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.  To calculate this metric for Limbach Holdings, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.21 = US$46m ÷ (US$343m - US$123m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>Limbach Holdings has an ROCE of 21%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Limbach Holdings </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/263324968-roce-1-dark-2/1762001534848\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:LMB Return on Capital Employed November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Limbach Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.  If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free analyst report for Limbach Holdings </a>. </p><h2> What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us </h2><p> We like the trends that we're seeing from Limbach Holdings.    The numbers show that in the last  five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 21%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 109%.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p> <p> One more thing to note, Limbach Holdings has decreased current liabilities to 36% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors.  This tells us that Limbach Holdings has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.   </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> To sum it up, Limbach Holdings has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last  five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Limbach Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> <strong>AtriCure, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ATRC</a>) defied analyst predictions to release its quarterly results, which were ahead of market expectations.      Results overall were solid, with revenues arriving 2.3% better than analyst forecasts at US$134m. Higher revenues also resulted in substantially lower statutory losses which, at US$0.01 per share, were 2.3% smaller than the analysts expected.     Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.  So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This would reflect a decent 16% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 70% to US$0.18.       Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$596.3m and US$0.22 per share in losses.         While the revenue estimates were largely unchanged, sentiment seems to have improved, with the analysts upgrading their numbers and making a favorable reduction in losses per share in particular.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for AtriCure </a></span></p> <p> There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$51.44, suggesting that reduced loss estimates are not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation.        It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean.  There are some variant perceptions on AtriCure, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$64.00 and the most bearish at US$40.00 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await AtriCure shareholders.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the AtriCure's past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/healthcare/medical-equipment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that AtriCure's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 18% over the past five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 8.4% per year.  So it's pretty clear that, while AtriCure's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on AtriCure. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple AtriCure analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> Even so, be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> AtriCure is showing <strong> 1 warning sign in our investment analysis</strong> </a>, you should know about...   </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>Astrana Health, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ASTH</a>) does carry debt.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Astrana Health's Net Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, Astrana Health had US$413.6m of debt at June 2025, down from US$442.0m a year prior.    On the flip side, it has US$342.1m in cash leading to net debt of about US$71.4m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/4634897-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762001677961\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:ASTH Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Astrana Health's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, Astrana Health had liabilities of US$459.7m due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$444.7m due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of US$342.1m and US$369.4m worth of receivables due within a year.   So its liabilities total US$192.9m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  </p><p> Since publicly traded Astrana Health shares are worth a total of US$1.59b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Astrana Health </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While Astrana Health's low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.72 suggests only modest use of debt, the fact that EBIT only covered the interest expense by 3.5 times last year does give us pause.  But the interest payments are certainly sufficient to have us thinking about how affordable its debt is.        Shareholders should be aware that Astrana Health's EBIT was down 27% last year.   If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Astrana Health can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, Astrana Health generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 84% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect.  That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Astrana Health's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better.   In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow.        We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like Astrana Health commonly do use debt without problems.     Considering this range of data points, we think Astrana Health is in a good position to manage its debt levels.  Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it.     There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Astrana Health</strong> </a> you should be aware of.    </p> <p> At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.
