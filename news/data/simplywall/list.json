The recent EirGrid win underscores Jacobs’ competitive credibility in transformational energy projects, but is unlikely to materially impact the most important short-term catalyst, visibility and conversion of its already record project backlog into near-term earnings.

This contract aligns closely with key business catalysts, as it demonstrates the company’s presence on energy modernization projects critical to multi-year revenue streams and future growth opportunities, supporting, but not transforming, the fundamental investment thesis.\n</p> <p> Yet, despite momentum in energy and infrastructure, investors should be mindful of the unpredictability of government spending and how...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/commercial-services/nyse-j/jacobs-solutions/dwdw3mrq-water-modernization-and-digital-transformation-will-shape-future-success-3u6w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Jacobs Solutions (it's free!)</a></p><p>Jacobs Solutions is projected to reach $14.4 billion in revenue and $971.8 million in earnings by 2028.

This approach aims to reveal what PepsiCo might truly be worth, based on how much money it is expected to generate over time.</p> <p>For PepsiCo, the most recent twelve months of Free Cash Flow came in at $6.4 Billion. Analysts forecast consistent growth, projecting Free Cash Flow to reach $11.4 Billion by the end of 2027. Looking further out, using Simply Wall St’s extrapolations, PepsiCo’s Free Cash Flow could rise to nearly $15 Billion by 2035. These figures reflect a steady upward trajectory in the company’s ability to generate cash, with analysts directly estimating the first five years and later years forecasted using trend-based calculations.</p> <p>The resulting intrinsic value from this DCF analysis is $223.84 per share. Based on the current share price, this represents a 34.7% discount, suggesting that PepsiCo stock is significantly undervalued by the market right now.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PepsiCo is undervalued by 34.7%.

Because earnings are the direct result of a company’s operations, comparing a company’s stock price to its earnings provides investors with a simple gauge of how much they’re paying for each dollar of profit.</p> <p>However, not all PE ratios should be treated equally. What counts as a “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors, including a company’s expected earnings growth, the risks it faces, and overall market conditions. Fast-growing or lower-risk companies often deserve a higher PE, while slower-growing or riskier businesses tend to trade at lower multiples.</p> <p>PepsiCo’s current PE ratio stands at 27.7x. This is above the average for the Beverage industry, which is 17.3x, and higher than the average for its peers at 25.3x. While these comparisons offer some context, Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” takes things further. The Fair Ratio for PepsiCo, calculated at 29.3x, quantifies the PE you’d expect for a stock with PepsiCo’s unique combination of growth prospects, risk profile, profit margin, market cap, and sector. This delivers a more tailored and meaningful benchmark than generic industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Because PepsiCo’s actual PE ratio of 27.7x is quite close to its Fair Ratio of 29.3x, the stock looks to be valued about right by the market at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PepsiCo Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is the story you, as an investor, tell about PepsiCo based on your view of its future. This story combines your forecasts for revenue, profit margins, or growth with your own sense of what the company’s fair value should be.</p> <p>Narratives bridge the gap between hard numbers and real-world context. They help you connect the company’s business story, such as new markets, product launches, or emerging risks, to a tailored financial forecast so you can decide what PepsiCo is truly worth to you. Narratives are easy to use and accessible right on Simply Wall St’s Community page, trusted by millions of investors. They allow you to anchor your investment decision around your assumptions. For example, when the Narrative’s fair value you set is above the current price, the stock could be a buy, and vice versa.</p> <p>What’s unique is that as new information comes in, such as a quarterly result, a major news announcement, or a shift in consumer trends, Narratives automatically update to reflect the latest data instantly. For example, among PepsiCo Narratives shared by investors, the most optimistic currently sees fair value above $160 per share driven by global expansion and digitalization, while the most cautious pegs it near $115 based on slower health product uptake and margin pressures.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PepsiCo? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Fiserv saw its shares tumble after the company missed third-quarter earnings expectations, lowered its guidance for 2025, and unveiled a series of leadership and board changes. The market reaction was immediate and reflected investor concerns.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-fi/fiserv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Fiserv.</a></p> <p>Fiserv’s painful quarter sent ripples through the fintech sector, with its share price plunging 44% in a single day following disappointing earnings and a reduced outlook. Recent leadership changes and missed forecasts have fueled intense risk aversion, erasing much of the stock’s prior gains and dragging its year-to-date share price return to negative 66%. Over the last year, shareholders have endured a total return loss of roughly 65%, and multi-year performance shows meaningful underperformance. This makes it clear that momentum has dramatically reversed course.</p> <p>If you’re rethinking your strategy in light of Fiserv’s slide, it might be time to broaden your radar and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With such a sharp valuation reset, investors are left to wonder whether Fiserv’s depressed share price presents a compelling entry point or if the market has already accounted for slowing growth and ongoing uncertainty.

Looking ahead, analysts see a sharp turnaround, forecasting earnings to grow at an exceptional 187.51% annually and shifting the company into profitability within three years. This is happening even as revenue growth of 5.7% per year trails the wider US market's 10.2% pace. The stock is currently trading at $12.65, well beneath its estimated fair value of $28.50, and features a Price-To-Sales Ratio of just 0.1x, highlighting a potentially attractive valuation for investors willing to weigh the short-term risks against robust profit growth estimates and apparent discount pricing.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-cwh/camping-world-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Camping World Holdings.</a> <p>Now that we have the key numbers on the table, let's see how these results compare to the prevailing market narratives and whether any expectations might need adjusting.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6e1y5x7f-flexible-living-will-ignite-domestic-entry-level-rv-demand-rski\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Camping World Holdings</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-cwh/camping-world-holdings/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CWH Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c1d3361d-f569-41db-8df9-d0695a020528/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CWH Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Margins Set to Climb from -0.1% to 5.5%</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts expect profit margins to expand from the current -0.1% to 5.5% over the next three years, reflecting optimism for a swift turnaround in operational efficiency and profitability that exceeds typical industry recovery timelines.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, operational improvements and targeted digital investments are cited as key drivers.

Margin gains of over 1 percentage point already support this thesis.\n      </li> <li> The shift to outcome-based commercial models aligns management strategy with analysts' forecasts for earnings per share rising from $1.92 to $2.65 over the next three years, reinforcing long-term stability in profit growth.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To see how these operational shifts fit the big-picture consensus, get the full story in the <strong>analysts’ narrative</strong>: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6wevnytq-ai-powered-expansion-and-global-partnerships-will-drive-future-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full ExlService Holdings Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings Discount vs Industry Peers</h2> <ul> <li> ExlService trades at a 25.3x price-to-earnings ratio, below the peer average of 33.4x and the industry average of 27.2x, while delivering higher historical earnings growth, signaling investors may be undervaluing its sustained profitability.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative points out that despite strong compounding earnings and margin trends, the market is not pricing ExlService at a premium, perhaps due to caution over future industry dynamics.\n    <ul> <li> Even with analyst forecasts for revenue growth of 10.9% annually and margin expansion, valuation remains restrained. This underscores a potential disconnect between robust fundamentals and current market expectations.\n      </li> <li> The 18.5% gap between the current share price ($38.54) and the nearest consensus price target ($52.71) reflects this ongoing hesitance, despite ExlService’s track record of outpacing industry averages.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Long-Term Risks: Margin Pressure and Sector Exposure</h2> <ul> <li> Analysts project profit margins will see only modest improvement, reaching 12.2% in three years from 12.0% today, as rising wage inflation in key outsourcing hubs like India and the Philippines continues to elevate costs.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative flags sector concentration and compliance challenges as principal risks, highlighting that heavy reliance on insurance and healthcare clients could amplify earnings volatility.\n    <ul> <li> Exposure to fast-changing regulatory environments in those sectors carries real risk for cross-border profitability, especially as new data privacy rules and reimbursement changes increase compliance costs.\n      </li> <li> Margin gains may be limited by talent shortages. Costs have grown 16 to 17 percent despite only 9 percent headcount increases, which could dilute the benefits of higher-value service offerings if not managed proactively.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6wevnytq-ai-powered-expansion-and-global-partnerships-will-drive-future-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for ExlService Holdings on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Looking at the results from a different angle?

While headline profit metrics present a strong performance, investors should note that over the past five years, earnings have actually declined by an average of 18.3% per year.

Its Price-To-Earnings Ratio sits at a deep discount compared to both the industry (15.3x) and peer group (22.8x), with its own P/E at just 0.6x.</li> <li> These figures underscore a tension in the prevailing narrative, which overshadows potential bullish arguments about value:\n    <ul> <li>Yield-focused investors may see the low P/E as a bargain, but the gap to DCF fair value challenges the perception that HEIM PREF is genuinely “cheap.”</li> <li>The strong earnings and margins resulted from a one-off SEK11.9 billion gain last year, rather than ongoing operations. This raises questions about future profitability at current price levels.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Lack of Recurring Profit Drivers</h2> <ul> <li>Over the past five years, earnings have declined on average by 18.3% per year, making the latest strong margin (40.4%) an outlier driven by non-recurring items, not by persistent business improvements.</li> <li> The prevailing market view is notable for its contrast between stable dividend expectations among income-seeking investors and the absence of genuine recurring earnings power:\n    <ul> <li>The one-year earnings jump of 791.5% stands in sharp contrast to the longer-term trend of shrinking profits.</li> <li>Without new recurring income streams, any bullish outlook on future distributions faces real headwinds from the weak longer-term track record.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Masks Sector Headwinds</h2> <ul> <li>Heimstaden’s P/E of 0.6x is deeply discounted compared to industry and peer group averages. However, this headline “cheapness” reflects sector-wide concerns over financial stability and non-recurring profit quality, not market enthusiasm.</li> <li> Prevailing analysis points to a defensive income appeal but also cautions that macro pressures, especially higher interest rates and real estate devaluation risks, remain at the forefront:\n    <ul> <li>Stable rental cash flows are a positive, yet sector volatility and weak underlying growth challenge any simple value thesis.</li> <li>Any recovery in price or profits is likely dependent on an improvement in sector conditions rather than company-specific momentum at this time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> <strong>Utssav CZ Gold Jewels Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:UTSSAV</a>) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 30% after a shaky period beforehand.    Taking a wider view, although not as strong as the last month, the full year gain of 16% is also fairly reasonable.   </p><p> Even after such a large jump in price, given about half the companies in India have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") above 28x, you may still consider Utssav CZ Gold Jewels as an attractive investment with its 22.3x P/E ratio.  Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings growth might actually underperform the broader market in the near future.

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 429% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is only predicted to deliver 25% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is stronger based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> With this information, we find it odd that Utssav CZ Gold Jewels is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  It looks like most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> The latest share price surge wasn't enough to lift Utssav CZ Gold Jewels' P/E close to the market median.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Utssav CZ Gold Jewels currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  When we see strong earnings with faster-than-market growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing significant pressure on the P/E ratio.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-utssav/utssav-cz-gold-jewels-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>4 warning signs for Utssav CZ Gold Jewels</strong> </a> (2 can't be ignored) you should be aware of.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a low P/E. </a> </p></div>",

If current liabilities hadn't increased as much as they did, the ROCE could actually be even lower.   And with current liabilities at these levels, suppliers or short-term creditors are effectively funding a large part of the business, which can introduce some risks.     </p> <h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> In short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence.      Unsurprisingly then, the stock has dived 88% over the last  five years, so investors are recognizing these changes and don't like the company's prospects.

This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 24% average annual increase in the share price.   This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  We note that for First International Bank of Israel the TSR over the last 5 years was 281%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> First International Bank of Israel shareholders are up 47% for the year (even including dividends).  But that was short of the market average.    On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 31% over half a decade  This suggests the company might be improving over time.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr18.76 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.   Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.    </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr151m for 7.95m shares.  On the other hand they divested 5.73k shares, for kr135k.     In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).</a> </p> <h2> Insider Ownership Of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria </h2><p> For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders.  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.   Insiders own 29% of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria shares, worth about kr596m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria Tell Us? </h2><p> It is good to see recent purchasing.    And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence.   However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious.     When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low.  Nice!      While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin.  We can see that <strong>Formula Systems (1985) Ltd.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:FORTY</a>) does use debt in its business.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2025 Formula Systems (1985) had debt of US$501.7m, up from US$472.7m in one year.    On the flip side, it has US$406.2m in cash leading to net debt of about US$95.5m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/386267-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798420891\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:FORTY Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Balance Sheet? </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Formula Systems (1985) had liabilities of US$1.19b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$540.9m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$406.2m in cash and US$883.2m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it has liabilities totalling US$444.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, Formula Systems (1985) has a  market capitalization of US$2.24b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Formula Systems (1985) </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). </p> <p> Formula Systems (1985)'s net debt is only 0.30 times its EBITDA.  And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 15.1 times over.  So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt.        Also good is that Formula Systems (1985) grew its EBIT at 12% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt.       The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Formula Systems (1985) will need earnings to service that debt.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Over the most recent three years, Formula Systems (1985) recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax.  This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> The good news is that Formula Systems (1985)'s demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler.   And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening.      Zooming out, Formula Systems (1985) seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us.  After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company.  As with many other companies <strong>NEPON Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:7985</a>) makes use of debt.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Why Does Debt Bring Risk? </h2><p> Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow.  Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> How Much Debt Does NEPON Carry? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NEPON had debt of JP¥1.76b at the end of June 2025, a reduction from JP¥1.95b over a year.    However, it does have JP¥790.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about JP¥972.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883647-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798465515\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7985 Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At NEPON's Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NEPON had liabilities of JP¥2.46b due within 12 months and liabilities of JP¥995.0m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had JP¥790.0m in cash and JP¥1.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by JP¥1.11b.   </p><p> This is a mountain of leverage  relative to its  market capitalization of JP¥1.40b.  Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for NEPON </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While we wouldn't worry about NEPON's net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.7, we think its super-low interest cover of 1.8 times is a sign of high leverage.   It seems that the business incurs large depreciation and amortisation charges, so maybe its debt load is heavier than it would first appear, since EBITDA is arguably a generous measure of earnings.   So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately.       One redeeming factor for NEPON is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of JP¥44m, over the last twelve months.     When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is NEPON's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow.    Over the last year, NEPON recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect.  That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Neither NEPON's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt.   But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience.       Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think NEPON's debt poses some risks to the business.  So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
