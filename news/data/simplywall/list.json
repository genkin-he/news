You're in the right place to find out what is really driving its value.</li> <li>After a solid 83.8% gain over the last five years, the stock has cooled off recently, down 1.4% in the past week and 10.5% year-to-date. This illustrates how quickly sentiment and risk perceptions can shift.</li> <li>Recent headlines about shifting global energy demand and volatility in commodity prices have fueled both optimism and caution around oil and gas producers. Coterra has been especially visible as analysts weigh in on its capital spending strategy and the broader outlook for natural gas markets.</li> <li>On our proprietary valuation checks, Coterra Energy scores an impressive <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>, suggesting strong all-round value.

This approach helps investors gauge whether a stock's market price reflects its potential to generate cash over time.\n</p> <p> For Coterra Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow stands at $1.50 Billion. Analysts provide detailed cash flow forecasts out to 2029, with projected Free Cash Flow rising to $2.60 Billion by that year. Over the full 10-year model horizon, which includes both analyst forecasts and methodical extrapolations, the company’s cash flows remain strong and show healthy growth. The pace moderates in later years as projections move beyond analyst coverage and rely on broader industry assumptions.\n</p> <p> According to this DCF model, Coterra’s intrinsic value is estimated at $65.90 per share. This implies the stock is trading at a 64.5% discount to its calculated fair value, suggesting that it is significantly undervalued based on projected future cash generation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coterra Energy is undervalued by 64.5%.

It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. Since earnings influence long-term shareholder returns, the PE ratio is especially useful for comparing companies within the same industry or across the broader market.\n</p> <p> A company's fair PE ratio depends on more than just profits. Growth expectations play a significant role; faster-growing companies often command higher multiples, while uncertainties or heightened risk can result in lower valuations. Stable profit margins and larger market capitalizations also tend to increase what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE.\n</p> <p> Coterra Energy is currently trading on an 11.33x PE multiple. This is below the Oil and Gas industry average of 12.59x and also comfortably under the peer group average of 16.72x. To provide a fuller picture, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" for each company that blends key factors such as expected earnings growth, industry trends, company size, profit margins, and risk. For Coterra, the Fair Ratio is 18.33x, indicating the stock is valued well below what would be expected given its underlying fundamentals.\n</p> <p> By using the Fair Ratio, investors gain a more tailored sense of value rather than relying solely on industry or peer averages. This approach adjusts for the nuances that make Coterra unique, capturing both upside growth and risk factors in a way that broad benchmarks cannot.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Coterra Energy Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a practical way for investors to tie together their view of a company's story, like Coterra's growth drivers or risks, with their forecasts for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins. This approach ultimately helps determine what they believe to be a fair value for the stock.\n</p> <p> Narratives connect the dots between \"what's happening at the company\" and \"what the numbers mean,\" allowing you to set your own assumptions and see the financial impact. On the Simply Wall St platform, Narratives are easy for anyone to create or follow within the Community page, empowering millions of users to document their perspectives and update them as news or earnings releases come in.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly see if your Fair Value signals a buy, hold, or sell opportunity compared to today's Price. Because these are updated dynamically with new information, they help you make timely, better-informed decisions.\n</p> <p> For example, one investor might build a Narrative assuming robust LNG-driven revenue growth and land at a Fair Value of $40. Another investor, more cautious on gas prices and regulatory risks, may set their Fair Value closer to $25. This demonstrates how your story shapes your strategy.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coterra Energy? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The share price dropped 11.7% over the past month and is down 13.2% year-to-date. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at -9.2%, long-term holders are still up a robust 64% over five years, showing the value of patience through the bank’s cycles. Ongoing executive transitions and new branch openings may offer fresh catalysts, but for now, investor sentiment remains cautious given recent earnings volatility.</p> <p>If this volatility has you curious about other opportunities, now’s the perfect moment to expand your watchlist and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>With shares now trading at a substantial discount to analyst targets, the crucial question is whether Dime Community Bancshares is undervalued after recent setbacks or if the market is simply reflecting realistic expectations for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 26.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Dime Community Bancshares closing at $26.34 and the most popular narrative setting fair value over $36, this large gap has fueled fresh optimism among narrative followers.

For a company like George Weston in the consumer retailing space, this metric indicates investor expectations for future profit growth and stability.</p> <p>At 31.6x, George Weston is valued significantly higher than both its North American and peer group averages of 20x. This premium suggests the market is expecting the company to deliver strong earnings growth or stability. However, according to fair value analysis, the justified level would be closer to 23.9x, which implies the current valuation could be considered high if those expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for George Weston</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 31.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower revenue growth or an unexpected dip in net income could quickly change investor sentiment and challenge the current valuation premium.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this George Weston narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Our DCF Model Suggests Upside</h2> <p>While George Weston's current share price looks expensive compared to earnings-based metrics, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

Looking ahead, annual earnings are forecast to rise 9.3% with revenues set to increase 3.6% yearly. However, these rates trail broader German market expectations. Investors are weighing ongoing margin improvements and a valuation that sits well below both industry and peer averages, all amid questions about the sustainability of recent gains.

Such wins build on its global presence and technology leadership, tying directly to the catalysts surrounding international expansion and the company’s ability to maintain earnings resilience outside North America.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that, in contrast, persistent regulatory pressures and decarbonization efforts could erode oilfield service demand and...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-hal/halliburton/m6v3al5o-power-generation-and-data-center-exposure-will-shape-future-risk-and-reward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Halliburton (it's free!)</a></p><p>Halliburton's outlook anticipates $22.1 billion in revenue and $2.0 billion in earnings by 2028.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.  While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> collection of companies boasting high return on equity</a>, or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> this list of stocks with significant insider holdings</a> to be useful.  </p></div>",

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins. Achieving this may prove challenging without clear pipeline successes.</li> <li>Investors may face a value-versus-quality decision, with an appealing entry price tempered by skepticism regarding future growth and profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bristol-myers-squibb-bmy-undervalued-opportunity-or-value-trap-a-deep-dive-into-2024-earnings-and-fair-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bristol-Myers Squibb on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a unique take on the figures?
