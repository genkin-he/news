Steelmaking is one of the more carbon intensive sectors, so public funding for low carbon production technologies is becoming an important theme for policymakers and large emitters alike.</p> <p>For investors, the new funding round raises questions around execution timelines, capital needs, and potential long term cost structures for cleaner steel. It also puts Salzgitter more clearly on the map in discussions about supply chains for low carbon materials and the role of policy support in reshaping heavy industry.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/materials/etr-szg/salzgitter-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Salzgitter</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

For you as an investor, that means a larger share of the upfront risk is being absorbed by the state rather than solely through Salzgitter's balance sheet or potential equity dilution. With European Commission approval already in place, regulatory risk around state aid also looks more contained, which can matter for long lead time industrial projects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Salzgitter Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The extra funding directly backs the green steel and SALCOS initiatives mentioned in the narrative, supporting the idea that regulatory support could underpin more stable margins and potential green premium pricing.</li> <li>Execution risk around restructuring and large capex, already flagged in the narrative, could still challenge the medium term earnings bridge if project costs rise or timelines slip, even with public money covering more than half the budget.</li> <li>The targeted 95% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions at full build out and the link to carbon border costs for global buyers are not fully captured in the existing storyline and could influence long term demand from customers focused on low CO₂ steel.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/n9cl0o1c-szg-future-gains-will-depend-on-european-flat-rolled-steel-price-trends\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Salzgitter</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Large, multi year capex still needs to be executed on time and on budget, and any setbacks could strain cash flow or require additional funding.</li> <li>⚠️ Competition from other European and global steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp, many of which are pursuing their own low CO₂ projects, may limit pricing power for green steel if supply grows faster than demand.</li> <li>🎁 Public funds covering more than half of the planned Salcos spend ease the financial burden on Salzgitter and support its position in low carbon steel as carbon regulation and customer requirements tighten.</li> <li>🎁 If buyers start to factor carbon border costs and emissions more heavily into sourcing decisions, Salzgitter's targeted 95% cut in direct CO₂ emissions could make its steel more attractive in global supply chains.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>You may want to watch how Salzgitter phases the remaining Salcos investments, including any updates on total project cost, commissioning milestones, and contract wins for low CO₂ products. Progress on securing long term offtake agreements with automotive, construction, and machinery customers will be important to see whether policy support translates into commercial traction. It is also worth tracking how peers such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp advance their own hydrogen or low CO₂ steel projects, as this will shape how differentiated Salzgitter really is.</p> <p>To stay informed on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Salzgitter, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SZG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Salzgitter</a> to keep up with the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For New Found Gold, this makes the balance sheet the key anchor, rather than current profits, given the company is still loss making with net income of CA$45.9m loss and no meaningful revenue reported.</p> <p>The contrast between looking cheap relative to a narrower peer set and expensive versus the wider industry highlights how much investors are paying up for New Found Gold compared to typical Canadian metals and mining names. If sentiment or project expectations shift, that P/B multiple is an area where the market could move closer to industry levels.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-nfg/new-found-gold-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 12.8x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, there are still clear risks, including New Found Gold’s CA$45.9m net loss and the potential for sentiment to weaken if exploration or project timelines disappoint.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-nfg/new-found-gold-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this New Found Gold narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF suggests more upside than P/B implies</h2> <p>While the current 12.8x P/B signals a rich price tag against the wider Canadian metals and mining group, our DCF model points in a different direction.

The reaffirmed US$0.53 dividend and 3.43% yield, backed by five years of increases, reinforces income visibility and does not materially change the near term catalysts, which still hinge on net interest income trends, credit quality and how closely results track the US$5.79 fiscal 2026 EPS estimate. Recent earnings show improved profit margins, but rising net charge offs highlight that credit costs are an active watchpoint. With the share price pulling back over the past week yet still showing solid multi year total returns, the dividend news mainly underpins confidence in the existing income profile rather than rewriting the risk picture.</p> However, rising charge offs and credit quality trends are information investors should be aware of.\n\nDespite retreating, Community Trust Bancorp's shares might still be trading 49% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ctbi/community-trust-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ctbi/community-trust-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CTBI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2d2e9153-70d6-4c75-b030-58fd1216bdc6/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CTBI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Four Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates span roughly US$50 to US$118, reflecting very different views on upside.

This suggests that momentum has been building rather than fading.</p> <p>If this board meeting has you thinking more broadly about power and infrastructure themes, it could be a good moment to look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as potential ideas beyond Meidensha.</p> <p>With the shares up strongly over the past year and trading slightly above the latest analyst target and intrinsic estimate, you have to ask: is Meidensha now fully priced, or could the upcoming board decisions create a fresh entry point?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 16x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a P/E of 16x, Meidensha sits slightly above the JP Machinery industry average of 15.4x, even though the shares are at ¥7,820, just above both the ¥7,600 analyst target and the ¥7,656.36 SWS DCF estimate of future cash flow value.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much you are paying for each unit of earnings and is a common yardstick for capital goods names like Meidensha. With earnings forecast to grow 3.59% per year and both revenue and earnings expected to expand more slowly than the broader JP market, the current earnings multiple suggests investors are paying up for a steadier profile rather than rapid growth.</p> <p>Where it gets more interesting is in the comparisons. Meidensha is described as expensive versus the Machinery industry average P/E of 15.4x, yet the same 16x multiple is flagged as good value versus an estimated fair P/E of 18.3x and a much higher peer average of 35.4x. If the market eventually shifts closer to that fair P/E level, it would imply more room in the earnings multiple than the industry comparison alone suggests.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6508/meidensha-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Meidensha</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 16x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, the board’s focus on officer changes and a possible dividend revision could reset expectations quickly if decisions differ from what the recent share price implies.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6508/meidensha-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Meidensha narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Paint a Slightly Richer Picture</h2> <p>The P/E of 16x looks roughly fair on earnings, but our DCF model points to a fair value of ¥7,656.36, slightly below the current ¥7,820 share price. That suggests the current move may already be pricing in a lot of good news.

For investors focused on catalysts, this result reinforces the idea that improved execution in investment sales, debt and equity advisory, and leasing can support earnings, while capital allocation toward buybacks may incrementally enhance per share outcomes if transactional markets remain supportive.</p> <p>Yet while recent results look encouraging, investors should still be aware of how sensitive JLL’s capital markets and leasing revenues are to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-jll/jones-lang-lasalle/9mfwc63m-expanding-recovery-and-ai-integration-will-reshape-us-real-estate-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Jones Lang LaSalle (it's free!)</a></p><p>Jones Lang LaSalle's narrative projects $31.5 billion revenue and $1.0 billion earnings by 2028.

This move pushes more of its product stack into the security spotlight. The stock last closed at $172.19, with a 1 year return of 18.5% and a 3 year return of 179.6%. These figures put the announcements into focus for investors following the company's evolution. The 5 year return of 156.9% offers a longer lens on how the market has treated Cloudflare's role in internet infrastructure.</p> <p>In the near term, investors watching NYSE:NET are likely to focus on how post-quantum encryption and the Mastercard partnership translate into product adoption and customer stickiness. As quantum computing risk and attacks on payment systems and small businesses receive more attention, Cloudflare's positioning around end to end cryptography and real time threat screening may become a more central part of how the company is evaluated.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-net/cloudflare/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

The latest quarter, with US$219.2 million in revenue modestly lower year on year but far ahead of expectations, reinforces the near term catalyst that matters most: evidence that the firm can beat a conservative profit bar even when activity is mixed. That sits alongside a still-young management team, a relatively high earnings multiple, and recent share price weakness despite an earnings beat, which together sharpen the risk that sentiment can swing quickly if deal flow or margins soften. For now, the new results look more sentiment reset than thesis changer.</p> However, one key risk around valuation and execution is easy to miss at first glance.\n\nPerella Weinberg Partners' share price has been on the slide but might be dropping deeper into value territory. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-pwp/perella-weinberg-partners/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out whether it's a bargain at this price</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-pwp/perella-weinberg-partners\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PWP 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a24e2b09-9cf0-4c00-b003-7179c869df72/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PWP 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value from the Simply Wall St Community clusters at US$25.63, suggesting a tight, optimistic view.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Aichi Steel (TSE:5482) has put corporate governance in focus after its February 27 board meeting, where directors backed a shift to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, pending shareholder approval in June.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Aichi Steel.</a></p> <p>The governance shift comes as the stock has been on a strong run, with a 1 day share price return of 4.32% and a 30 day share price return of 11.62%. The 1 year total shareholder return is about double and the 3 year total shareholder return is a little over 5x, pointing to momentum that has already reshaped how the market is pricing Aichi Steel’s progress.</p> <p>If these moves have you thinking about where else strong governance and execution could show up next, it might be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> as a way to surface fresh ideas beyond Aichi Steel.</p> <p>With the shares already delivering very large multi year returns and trading at about a 6% intrinsic discount, the key question now is whether Aichi Steel is still cheap or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred P/E of 19.1x: Is It Justified?</h2> <p>On the numbers, Aichi Steel is trading on a P/E of 19.1x, while our DCF work suggests the shares are at about a 94.5% discount to an estimated future cash flow value of ¥63,651.95 per share versus a last close of ¥3,505. That mix of a relatively high earnings multiple and a very large modelled discount is what many investors will want to unpack.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share. A 19.1x multiple effectively indicates how much the market is paying for each unit of current earnings. For a metals and mining name that is not a bank, this is a common way to benchmark sentiment around the earnings stream.</p> <p>However, Aichi Steel’s P/E of 19.1x is described as expensive relative to both the JP Metals and Mining industry average of 14.5x and a peer average of 11.8x. That suggests the market is attaching a richer price tag to its earnings than many peers. At the same time, our DCF model, which projects future cash flows and discounts them back to today, points to a very large gap between the current ¥3,505 price and a theoretical ¥63,651.95 value.</p> <p>Compared with industry and peer P/E levels, the premium is clear and sizeable. Any investor leaning on this multiple has to judge whether the earnings profile and recent profit growth justify paying more than the sector and peer norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 19.1x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh risks such as earnings not supporting a 19.1x P/E and any governance changes failing to translate into consistent operational discipline.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Aichi Steel narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests A Very Different Price</h2> <p>While the 19.1x P/E points to an expensive share price relative to industry and peers, our DCF model paints the opposite picture, with Aichi Steel at ¥3,505 compared with an estimated future cash flow value of ¥63,651.95. That gap raises a simple question: which signal do you trust more, the earnings multiple or the cash flow model?</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"5482 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/95517a98-2859-4939-b161-4c983a62acd9/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>5482 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out Aichi Steel for example</a>).

This puts the focus squarely on how efficiently that top line is being converted into earnings. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$65.2 million in Q3 2024 to US$100.3 million in Q4 2024, then to US$99.9 million in Q1 2025, US$103.0 million in Q2 2025, US$118.6 million in Q3 2025 and US$134.3 million in Q4 2025.

Developments in PFAS and silica dust regulation, along with any new disclosures on related claims, are also important to track, as they can influence future cash needs and product decisions.</p> <p>To stay updated on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Mohawk Industries, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/MHK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Mohawk Industries</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
