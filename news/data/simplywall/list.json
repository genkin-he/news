The 2025 net loss of C$140.86 million sharpens the focus on near term catalysts like Kiniero’s ramp-up to commercial production, successful execution under the Sprott debt facility, and the company’s ability to turn recent capital raises into stable operating cash flow. At the same time, it brings existing risks into clearer view: aggressive use of equity financing, a relatively new management team and board, and a business that is still unprofitable with rising historical losses. With the share price already up strongly over the past year, this earnings hit looks material to the risk side of the story, even as the core project thesis remains unchanged.</p> However, one key funding and dilution risk here is easy to underestimate.\n\nRobex Resources' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-rbx/robex-resources-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-rbx/robex-resources-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:RBX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b882300b-bad9-4903-a48e-7ab6f8c195a1/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:RBX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span C$2.90 to C$16.92, underlining how far opinions diverge.

The latest 9% revenue guidance and related stock drop reinforce, rather than change, those priorities.</p> <p>The most relevant update is Planet Fitness’s 2026 outlook for about 9% revenue growth, which came in below prior targets and coincided with a roughly 9% one day share price decline. This softer guidance matters because it directly challenges more optimistic expectations for accelerating revenue, and puts extra weight on near term membership retention, franchise economics and the payoff from recent club openings in 2025 and the planned capital spending increase in 2026.</p> <p>But while growth headlines grab attention, the bigger story investors should be aware of is the rising member churn risk and what it could mean for...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-services/nyse-plnt/planet-fitness/wb9jilna-global-club-expansion-and-youth-engagement-will-foster-future-success-fk2l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Planet Fitness (it's free!)</a></p><p>Planet Fitness' narrative projects $1.6 billion revenue and $312.8 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-services/nyse-plnt/planet-fitness/wb9jilna-global-club-expansion-and-youth-engagement-will-foster-future-success-fk2l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Planet Fitness' forecasts yield a $130.00 fair value</a>, a 58% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-plnt/planet-fitness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLNT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a7366dce-ba7e-4208-826a-0b5698010796/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLNT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were assuming revenue could reach about US$1.8 billion and earnings about US$334 million, but the new 9% growth outlook and higher churn risk show how quickly those narratives might need to be revisited and why your own view on Planet Fitness’s path from here really matters.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-services/nyse-plnt/planet-fitness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on Planet Fitness</a> - why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!</p><h2>Form Your Own Verdict</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

It concluded that the MXDA operation would not secure sufficient profit, so investors now face a clearer, though narrower, capital allocation path.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company.</a></p> <p>The decision to shut down the Dutch MXDA project comes after a period of strong share price momentum, with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company’s 30 day share price return of 41.73% and 90 day return of 61.78%, alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 97.88% that outpaces its shorter term moves.</p> <p>If this kind of portfolio reshaping has you looking beyond a single chemicals name, it could be a good moment to scan the market using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company posting strong recent returns yet still trading at a small intrinsic discount, is the MXDA setback already reflected in the share price, or is the market quietly pricing in additional developments?</p> <h2>Preferred Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On our numbers, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company trades on a P/S of 1.1x, which screens as good value against peers even after the recent share price strength.</p> <p>P/S compares the company’s market value to its revenue and is often used for businesses where earnings are uneven or currently negative. This is the case here, with a reported loss of ¥16,252.0 on revenue of ¥739,862.0.</p> <p>At 1.1x, the market is paying a lower sales multiple than the peer average of 1.8x. This points to a discount on current revenue even though the company is unprofitable and forecast revenue growth of 4.1% a year is slower than the wider JP market forecast of 5.2%.</p> <p>Compared to the JP Chemicals industry average P/S of 0.8x, however, the shares sit at a premium. Our estimated fair P/S of 1x suggests some scope for the multiple to gravitate closer to that level over time if expectations cool or execution disappoints.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the recent loss of ¥16,252 and the board’s willingness to scrap projects that fall short against that small intrinsic discount.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle, our DCF model</h2> <p>While the 1.1x P/S ratio suggests Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company is only slightly ahead of our fair ratio, our DCF model points to a different angle.

The latest quarter’s US$60.33 million in revenue and US$37.48 million in net income, alongside 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million, supports that tower-focused story, but the key near term risk remains execution on this pivot and the durability of carrier demand rather than the recent handset or retail wireless headlines, which are not especially material here.</p> <p>Among recent developments, management’s 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million stands out as the clearest reference point for the new tower-heavy model. It effectively replaces the prior wireless service metrics as the main yardstick many investors will watch against Array’s current valuation and income profile. How consistently the company delivers within or above that range, and how that ties to tower lease activity with carriers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, is likely to shape near term sentiment around the stock.</p> <p>Yet beneath this clearer tower story, investors should still be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/telecom/nyse-ad/array-digital-infrastructure/m7bdsy5m-t-mobile-deal-and-tower-agreements-will-drive-digital-infrastructure-transition\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Array Digital Infrastructure (it's free!)</a></p><p>Array Digital Infrastructure’s narrative projects $3.6 billion in revenue and $173.7 million in earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Mazda Motor (TSE:7261) has drawn investor attention after recent share price moves, with the stock showing double digit returns over the past month and past 3 months, alongside reported revenue and net income figures.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7261/mazda-motor-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Mazda Motor.</a></p> <p>Beyond the recent jump, Mazda Motor’s 30 day share price return of 22.28% and year to date share price return of 11.48% sit alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 45.10%. This suggests that momentum has been building over both shorter and longer horizons.</p> <p>If Mazda’s recent move has you looking across the market, it could be a good moment to scan our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With Mazda trading at ¥1,388.5 versus an average analyst target of ¥1,311.14 and an intrinsic value estimate suggesting an 8.07% premium, you need to ask whether there is still a buying opportunity here, or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 99.6x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Mazda Motor is trading on a P/E of 99.6x, which sits alongside the recent share price of ¥1,388.5 and points to a rich earnings valuation relative to peers.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price to earnings per share, so a higher P/E usually reflects the market paying more for each unit of current earnings. For Mazda, that high multiple sits against low net profit margins of 0.2% and a Return on Equity of 0.5%, which suggests the price is not being anchored by recent profitability.</p> <p>Relative signals back this up. Mazda is described as expensive versus the Asian Auto industry average P/E of 19.3x, and also high compared to the peer average P/E of 55.5x. Against an estimated fair P/E of 30.8x, the current 99.6x multiple is well above the level our models indicate the market could move towards if expectations cooled.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7261/mazda-motor-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Mazda Motor</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 99.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, the high 99.6x P/E multiple, based on net income of ¥8,790 on revenue of ¥4,830,973 and a value score of 0, could limit upside if sentiment cools.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7261/mazda-motor-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Mazda Motor narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Tell a Similar Story</h2> <p>If you look at Mazda Motor through our DCF model instead of earnings multiples, the picture does not really soften.

It gives a quick sense of how much investors are paying for each unit of profit. For a mature food business like Nippn, investors often look at this ratio to judge whether they are paying up for stability or getting a lower entry point relative to the sector.</p> <p>According to the data, Nippn is described as “good value” on several fronts. Its P/E of 11.5x is below an estimated “fair” P/E of 12.8x. It is also lower than the JP Food industry average of 17x and below a peer average of 14.6x, which suggests the market is pricing Nippn’s earnings more cautiously than many comparable companies.</p> <p>This kind of discount relative to both a fair ratio and sector peers can sometimes reflect concerns mentioned elsewhere, such as earnings being forecast to decline and recent pressure on profit margins, rather than any single short term event.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nippn</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 11.5x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh risks such as the 4.92% decline in annual net income and any strain from higher leverage after the ¥20b bond issue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/food-beverage-tobacco/tse-2001/nippn-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nippn narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Huge Gap On Our DCF Model</h2> <p>There is a very different picture when you look at Nippn through our DCF model.

At the same time, broader market discussions around materials and construction stocks have given context to Vulcan's share price moves, as investors compare it to peers and sector trends.</li> <li>Despite that backdrop, Vulcan Materials currently has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. Next, we will look at how different valuation approaches, and a more holistic view at the end of the article, might help you judge whether the current price lines up with your own expectations.</li> </ul> <p>Vulcan Materials scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

Analysts provide explicit projections through 2028, with free cash flow for that year modeled at $1.60b. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates out to 2035, generating a full 10 year cash flow path in dollar terms.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF output points to an estimated intrinsic value of about $269.82 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$310.00, this output indicates that Vulcan Materials is around 14.9% overvalued on this model.</p> <p>On this DCF view, the current market price is above the modelled cash flow value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Vulcan Materials may be overvalued by 14.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"VMC Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b5c73fc4-1c78-42f4-b741-436f7057bd54/chart/dcf?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>VMC Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Vulcan Materials.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Vulcan Materials Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Vulcan Materials, the P/E ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of earnings. In general, higher expected earnings growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk tends to align with a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Vulcan Materials is trading on a P/E of 37.44x. That compares with an average P/E of 15.56x for the wider Basic Materials industry and a peer group average of 27.79x, so the stock is priced above both of those reference points. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for Vulcan Materials of 24.44x. This is the P/E it might trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market capitalization and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific drivers rather than assuming one size fits all. Lining up the current P/E of 37.44x against the Fair Ratio of 24.44x suggests Vulcan Materials is trading at a richer multiple than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VMC P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b5c73fc4-1c78-42f4-b741-436f7057bd54/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VMC P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You can plug in the assumptions you believe in, see the Fair Value that falls out of those numbers, and quickly judge whether that is above or below Vulcan Materials' current share price.</p> <p>Because Narratives update as new information comes in, such as earnings, guidance or news about highway spending and buybacks, your story and its Fair Value do not stay frozen. They move with the data so you can keep checking whether the gap between price and value still supports holding, trimming or adding.</p> <p>For Vulcan Materials, one investor might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to US$340 per share that leans on stronger infrastructure demand and margin expansion. Another might prefer a more cautious Narrative nearer US$190 to US$239.78 per share that leans on sustainability pressures, regulation and slower construction. Both can see in one place how their different stories link to different Fair Values and decisions.</p> <p>For Vulcan Materials, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Vulcan Materials Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/0leo7c01-highway-project-spending-and-pricing-trends-will-sustain-balanced-opportunity-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Vulcan Materials Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish Narrative: US$327.57 per share</p> <p>Gap to that fair value at the recent US$310.00 price: about 5.4% below the Narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 5.34% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp expect infrastructure spending, Sunbelt demand and disciplined pricing to support revenue and earnings over several years.</li> <li>They factor in higher profit margins over time, supported by cost control, automation, acquisitions and a steady project pipeline.</li> <li>Their numbers line up with an analyst consensus price target around US$304.05 and a fair value estimate near US$327.57, with the view that the current price is broadly in line with those assumptions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/3wytubgl-shifting-urbanization-and-sustainability-will-erode-traditional-aggregates?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Vulcan Materials Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish Narrative: US$264.31 per share</p> <p>Gap to that fair value at the recent US$310.00 price: about 14.8% above the Narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 8.75% a year</p> <ul> <li>This group flags long term headwinds from sustainability trends, regulation, reserve quality and alternative building methods that could pressure traditional aggregate demand.</li> <li>They still model revenue and earnings growth, but think the P/E multiple implied by the current price asks too much of future execution and market conditions.</li> <li>Their updated fair value of about US$264.31 reflects those concerns, with the view that recent gains leave less room for error.</li> </ul> <p>Taken together, these Narratives frame a clear range for Vulcan Materials, from a more optimistic fair value near US$327.57 to a more cautious one around US$264.31. Your own view on volumes, margins and the P/E you are comfortable with will decide which story feels closer to reality.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

This likely enhances market share, pricing power, and sustains net margins as regulatory emphasis on abuse deterrence grows.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tzlmd05y-specialty-pharmaceuticals-and-diversified-assets-will-drive-future-success-jtot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Want to see what kind of profit margins and earnings path have to line up with that view? The most followed narrative leans on a very specific mix of modest revenue shifts, rising profitability and a future earnings multiple that is lower than many peers expect.

The latest update sharpens that tradeoff. On one hand, the 2025 net loss widening to US$766.63 million reinforces that this is a pure clinical-stage story with no revenue and rising operating costs. On the other, raising about US$408.10 million via an at-the-market equity program, layering on new shelf capacity tied to employee stock plans, reporting unprecedented VAX-31 Phase 2 data, moving quickly into several Phase 3 trials and finishing a large-scale manufacturing facility all feed directly into the near-term catalysts: clinical readouts, regulatory milestones and potential partnering discussions. The key risk profile also shifts slightly, with financing risk reduced for now but dilution, trial execution and commercial build-out risks front and center. Overall, the February 2026 news is material because it both extends the funding runway and accelerates the company toward its most binary events.</p> However, investors should not overlook how rising losses and ongoing dilution could affect future outcomes.\n\nVaxcyte's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 33%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-pcvx/vaxcyte/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-pcvx/vaxcyte\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PCVX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a5c22673-aeb2-4b4c-9e84-eb62a6baad5a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PCVX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Three Simply Wall St Community fair values, from US$10.90 to US$109.00, show just how far apart expectations sit.

The new Grade A MiQ methane certification strengthens CRC’s environmental credentials and may support pricing under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, but it does not materially change the near term earnings catalyst around the upcoming March 2 results or the central permitting and regulatory risk.</p> <p>The MiQ announcement lines up most directly with CRC’s push to maximize value from lower methane intensity production and its broader decarbonization projects, including carbon capture and storage. Analysts were already watching how CRC balances capital returns with investments in CCS and emissions reduction, and this expanded certification gives more real world evidence of progress on that front, even as forecasts still call for modest revenue growth and shrinking profit margins.</p> <p>Yet against this positive certification story, investors should be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-crc/california-resources/hbvb0txi-regulatory-reforms-and-ccs-projects-will-reshape-energy-amid-uncertainty-ud7v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on California Resources (it's free!)</a></p><p>California Resources' narrative projects $3.0 billion revenue and $161.5 million earnings by 2028.

The key near term drivers still sit in execution against its cloud and supply chain software opportunity, plus how the market responds to guidance around margins and growth. The planned CFO transition to long‑time insider Linda Pinne, with Dennis Story staying on as advisor, looks designed to limit disruption rather than reset strategy, and the recent share price pullback suggests investors are not treating the news as thesis‑changing. The bigger question remains whether the company can keep justifying a higher valuation after a year of weaker share returns and moderating earnings growth.</p> However, investors should be aware of how much they are paying for that growth profile.\n\nDespite retreating, Manhattan Associates' shares might still be trading 44% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MANH 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/932912c6-0960-4475-b00a-aa3676dad717/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MANH 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-manh/manhattan-associates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 4 other fair value estimates on Manhattan Associates</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 78% more than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?
