Over the last five years, the companyâ€™s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 9.9%, and future earnings are forecast to rise by 12.07% per year, though this pace trails the broader US marketâ€™s 15.7% projection.

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.    However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For Yoram Naveh Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> According to our data, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has a market capitalization of â‚ª15b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth â‚ª3.3m over the year to December 2024.   That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth â‚ª3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from â‚ª6.5b to â‚ª21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was â‚ª2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">â‚ª3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">â‚ª3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">â‚ª3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">â‚ª3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!      We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this more detailed historical graph</a> of earnings, revenue and cash flow.  </p> <h2>Has Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

This strong momentum puts the stock in focus for investors who want to understand what is driving its performance.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/be/capital-goods/ebr-cener/cenergy-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Cenergy Holdings.</a></p> <p>Cenergy Holdingsâ€™ 71% total shareholder return over the past year stands out against a backdrop of accelerating momentum. The company has also seen a 36.7% share price return in the last 90 days and strong multi-year performance. This recent surge suggests investors are responding favorably to the companyâ€™s growth outlook and improving fundamentals, keeping the energy and industrials specialist firmly in the spotlight.</p> <p>If youâ€™re tracking impressive moves like these, nowâ€™s a perfect time to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares up sharply and analyst price targets already in sight, the key question now is whether Cenergy Holdings remains undervalued or if the recent rally means future growth is fully reflected in the price.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 4.5% Overvalued</h2> <p>With Cenergy Holdingsâ€™ last close at â‚¬14.22 and a narrative fair value of â‚¬13.61, the current price sits slightly above the most-followed forecast. Letâ€™s examine a key justification driving that target.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Strategic capacity expansions across submarine and land cable facilities, including the upcoming Thiva and Baltimore (U.S.) plants, position Cenergy to address growing addressable markets and further benefit from long-term grid enhancement needs. This is expected to lift sales volumes and operating leverage, which could positively impact margins and earnings.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ob65csgr-global-cable-expansions-will-drive-grid-modernization\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Whatâ€™s the secret behind this ambitious valuation? It centers on how scale upgrades could potentially alter this companyâ€™s growth outlook. Want to see how future earnings, margins, and market opportunities are combined to arrive at that number?

Even healthy companies may need to adjust dividends if cash flows tighten.</li> <li>The watchpoint is whether future profits can maintain or increase current payout levels while still supporting reinvestment and growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Suggests Premium Pricing</h2> <ul> <li>The latest share price of 1,234.00 trades at a significant premium to the DCF fair value estimate of 687.51, highlighting a substantial gap between market confidence and modeled intrinsic worth.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis calls attention to this disconnect, with the companyâ€™s relatively low earnings multiple contrasting sharply with its share price premium, raising questions as to whether optimism is outpacing fundamentals.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap may signal either a strong belief that profit quality will endure or that the market is betting on better-than-modeled growth ahead.</li> <li>This divide puts future quarters under a microscope to see if actual results close that valuation gap, or if risk perceptions eventually catch up with the stockâ€™s pricing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.06.  Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.   </p> <p> Stuart Richardson bought a total of 5.15m shares over the year at an average price of AU$0.023.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Canadian Phosphate insiders own 27% of the company, worth about AU$4.9m.  This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Canadian Phosphate Tell Us? </h2><p> Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months.  The net investment is not enough to encourage us much.     However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Insiders own shares in Canadian Phosphate and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future.
