Over the last five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 9.9%, and future earnings are forecast to rise by 12.07% per year, though this pace trails the broader US market’s 15.7% projection.

Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an average annual rate of 11%. However, recent figures point to negative earnings growth, making like-for-like short-term comparisons less straightforward. Looking ahead, analysts expect earnings to increase by 8.49% per year and revenue to expand by 4.1% per year, both slower than the broader US market.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.  A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>).

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company’s inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine’s filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company’s current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company’s discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Cenergy Holdings (ENXTBR:CENER) has quietly posted some eye-catching returns over the past year, with shares climbing more than 70%. This strong momentum puts the stock in focus for investors who want to understand what is driving its performance.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/be/capital-goods/ebr-cener/cenergy-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Cenergy Holdings.</a></p> <p>Cenergy Holdings’ 71% total shareholder return over the past year stands out against a backdrop of accelerating momentum. The company has also seen a 36.7% share price return in the last 90 days and strong multi-year performance. This recent surge suggests investors are responding favorably to the company’s growth outlook and improving fundamentals, keeping the energy and industrials specialist firmly in the spotlight.</p> <p>If you’re tracking impressive moves like these, now’s a perfect time to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares up sharply and analyst price targets already in sight, the key question now is whether Cenergy Holdings remains undervalued or if the recent rally means future growth is fully reflected in the price.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 4.5% Overvalued</h2> <p>With Cenergy Holdings’ last close at €14.22 and a narrative fair value of €13.61, the current price sits slightly above the most-followed forecast.

Even healthy companies may need to adjust dividends if cash flows tighten.</li> <li>The watchpoint is whether future profits can maintain or increase current payout levels while still supporting reinvestment and growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Suggests Premium Pricing</h2> <ul> <li>The latest share price of 1,234.00 trades at a significant premium to the DCF fair value estimate of 687.51, highlighting a substantial gap between market confidence and modeled intrinsic worth.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis calls attention to this disconnect, with the company’s relatively low earnings multiple contrasting sharply with its share price premium, raising questions as to whether optimism is outpacing fundamentals.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap may signal either a strong belief that profit quality will endure or that the market is betting on better-than-modeled growth ahead.</li> <li>This divide puts future quarters under a microscope to see if actual results close that valuation gap, or if risk perceptions eventually catch up with the stock’s pricing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

That single transaction was for AU$110k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.022 each.   Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.06.  Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.   </p> <p> Stuart Richardson bought a total of 5.15m shares over the year at an average price of AU$0.023.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Canadian Phosphate insiders own 27% of the company, worth about AU$4.9m.  This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Canadian Phosphate Tell Us? </h2><p> Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months.  The net investment is not enough to encourage us much.     However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Insiders own shares in Canadian Phosphate and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future.

Despite the recent uptick in production and turnover, the one-year total shareholder return stands at -13.25%, and long-term holders have experienced deeper declines. Recent events have sharpened market focus on the company’s progress. Investors appear to be weighing growth potential against past volatility as sentiment gradually stabilizes.</p> <p>If the shift in outlook has you wondering what other renewable leaders are up to, it might be the perfect time to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Given the recent results, is Voltalia undervalued at current levels, or has the market already adjusted for improved production and future guidance, leaving little room for outsized gains?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Sales of 1.7x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Based on the current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.7x, Voltalia appears attractively valued compared to both its peers and broader industry benchmarks, especially given its last close price of €7.37.</p> <p>The P/S ratio compares a company's market value to its annual sales and provides an indicator of how much investors are willing to pay for each euro of revenue. For a company like Voltalia, which is currently unprofitable but exhibiting revenue growth and expectations of a turnaround, this metric helps gauge market optimism versus business fundamentals.</p> <p>Voltalia trades at a P/S ratio of 1.7x, noticeably below the European Renewable Energy industry average of 2.4x and well under the peer average of 5x. In addition, the estimated fair P/S ratio for Voltalia is 2.9x, suggesting upside if the market eventually rewards its anticipated growth and path to profitability.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/utilities/epa-vltsa/voltalia-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Voltalia</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.7x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, weak long-term returns and recent share price volatility could challenge bullish expectations if performance does not meet rising forecasts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/utilities/epa-vltsa/voltalia-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Voltalia narrative.</a></p> <h2> Build Your Own Voltalia Narrative</h2> <p>If you have a different take on Voltalia’s outlook or want to interpret the company’s progress in your own way, it only takes a couple of minutes to analyze the numbers for yourself and shape your perspective. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative\" href=\"https://support.simplywall.st/hc/en-us/articles/10353275550479-Stock-Valuator-with-Narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Do it your way</a>.</p> <p>A great starting point for your Voltalia research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/utilities/epa-vltsa/voltalia-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards and 1 important warning sign</a> that could impact your investment decision.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>Seize new opportunities by targeting stocks that align with your strategy.
