Recent moves may reflect shifting views on Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' growth potential in rare disease treatments and how investors balance that against risks and valuation.</p> <p>If Rhythm Pharmaceuticals has caught your eye, it could be a good moment to see what else is setting the pace in the sector via our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 healthcare AI stocks</a>.</p> <p>With Rhythm trading at US$99.15, an intrinsic value estimate at a discount, and a sizeable gap to the US$141.80 analyst target, you have to ask: is this a genuine mispricing or is future growth already fully reflected?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 24.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' most followed valuation narrative pegs fair value at $131.50, comfortably above the recent $99.15 close. This raises clear questions about what is priced in around rare disease obesity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals enters late February 2026 as the leader in \"rare disease obesity,\" a niche that has remained remarkably insulated from the broader GLP-1 price wars. The company’s core asset, Setmelanotide, has seen rapid uptake in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and POMC deficiency, where traditional weight-loss drugs often fail.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>It is worth examining how a single rare disease franchise supports that higher fair value. The narrative leans heavily on scaling revenue, future margins and a shift to sustained profitability, and it is important to understand which specific cash flow assumptions are most influential.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $131.50 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_user_generated_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the story could change quickly if key Phase 3 programs disappoint, or if the current annual net loss of about US$197.7m forces fresh equity raises.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rytm/rhythm-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Rhythm Pharmaceuticals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: rich sales multiple despite DCF upside</h2> <p>Our DCF model suggests Rhythm could be trading below future cash flow value at $448.88 per share, which supports the undervalued narrative.

The recent surge in returns and very low price to earnings multiple are attractive on the surface, but they also sit alongside large one off gains and a fund that generates limited recurring revenue. Saba Capital’s renewed push for a comprehensive strategic review adds a fresh near term catalyst around the discount to net asset value, fee structure, and even the fund’s offshore setup, but it also injects more uncertainty into an already volatile vehicle with a relatively inexperienced board. The activism could prove material, yet it may not change the core reality that ASA’s fortunes remain tightly tied to swings in gold equities.</p> However, one governance risk in particular is something investors should not ignore.\n\nASA Gold and Precious Metals' shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how much higher they are than fair value</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/530981a7-5ecc-48bb-9ea8-c64c17ef3d80/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community currently has 1 fair value estimate around US$42.72, yet recent activism and governance turnover may matter more for ASA’s path than any single model suggests, so you should weigh multiple viewpoints.<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore another fair value estimate on ASA Gold and Precious Metals</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as $42.72!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with this assessment?

The current 31.9% margin alongside trailing EPS of US$12.00 gives some backing to that bullish view, even as:\n    <ul> <li>Same restaurant sales growth in 2025 swung from a 1% decline in Q1 to positive growth of 3.8% and 3.6% in Q2 and Q3, showing mixed traffic trends beneath the margin stability.</li> <li>Net income over the last four quarters moved in a relatively tight range between US$1.9b and US$2.3b, which fits the idea of steady earnings but not rapid acceleration.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>McDonald's Future Earnings Per Share Growth</p> <h2>Store base tops 44,000 with mixed traffic</h2> <ul> <li>Total restaurants increased from 43,756 in Q1 2025 to 44,599 by Q3 2025, while same restaurant sales growth moved from a 1% decline in Q1 to gains of 3.8% in Q2 and 3.6% in Q3.</li> <li>Bears highlight the risk that declining low income traffic and market saturation could pressure U.S. revenues. The swing from a 1.5% decline in same restaurant sales in Q3 2024 to positive mid single digit growth in 2025 supports the idea that traffic is not uniformly weak, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The reliance on higher same restaurant sales growth to support future earnings means any renewed traffic softness could limit how much benefit McDonald's gets from its larger 44,000 plus store base.</li> <li>Concerns about market saturation and franchisee economics remain relevant, because unit growth from 42,819 restaurants in Q3 2024 to 44,599 in Q3 2025 needs to be matched by healthy guest counts to sustain systemwide sales.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Critics who focus on traffic risk may want to see how that concern stacks up against the numbers in the dedicated bear case for McDonald's, which digs into same restaurant sales trends, cost pressures, and unit growth assumptions. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 McDonald's Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Premium valuation above DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$333.01, McDonald's trades at a trailing P/E of 27.6x versus the US Hospitality industry average of 23.2x, sits below the peer average of 55.8x, and is above a DCF fair value estimate of about US$242.21.</li> <li>Supportive investors point to 5 year annual earnings growth of 8.3% and forecast earnings growth of roughly 6.8% per year. Those figures, combined with a 2.23% dividend yield and a 31.9% net margin, heavily support the bullish case that a premium P/E can be justified, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the current share price of US$333.01 and the DCF fair value of about US$242.21 underlines the risk that some buyers are paying above modeled cash flow value.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 5.1% per year is not especially high, so a 27.6x P/E relies on confidence that margins and earnings growth near 6.8% can be maintained.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you're trying to decide whether that premium price tag fits with your own expectations for growth and cash generation, it can help to see how bullish investors frame the long term story around digital, margins, and capital returns in one place. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 McDonald's Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/8bb6ppxs-mcdonalds-a-fundamental-and-historical-valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for McDonald's on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Feeling torn between the bullish and cautious takes here?

(NYSE:OMF) is drawing increased attention for its role in consumer finance, and its presence in the Russell 1000 index reflects growing institutional interest.</li> <li>The company’s focus on personalized lending services is standing out against peers and reinforcing its position in the consumer finance segment.</li> <li>Recent stock data shows NYSE:OMF closed at $56.37, with a 1 year return of 14.6% and a 3 year return of 67.9%.</li> </ul> <p>For investors watching consumer lenders, OneMain Holdings sits at an interesting crossroads. The stock trades at $56.37 and has delivered a 14.6% return over the past year and a 67.9% return over the past 3 years, which helps frame how the market has been treating the stock so far. Its inclusion in the Russell 1000 index and the associated institutional presence add another layer of attention around the name.</p> <p>What is especially relevant now is how OneMain’s personalized lending approach is helping it stand out within consumer finance. As institutional holders stay engaged and the company continues to serve a broad base of borrowers, investors may focus on how that model compares with other listed lenders. This article looks at what that growing interest might mean for those tracking NYSE:OMF today.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-omf/onemain-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OneMain Holdings</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This indicates investors have been responding positively to both recent earnings news and earlier corporate moves.</p> <p>If Hafnia’s recent update has you looking at shipping and energy exposure more closely, it can be a good moment to broaden your search with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">98 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <p>With Hafnia trading at NOK 69.14 against an analyst price target of NOK 74.25 and an intrinsic value estimate that appears materially higher, the big question is whether this signals an opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 5.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>Hafnia’s most followed narrative puts fair value at NOK 73.33 versus the NOK 69.14 last close.

Ferguson’s involvement in large capital projects positions it well for continued growth in this diversified segment, which should help improve margins as the business scales.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bw4fdt4y-organic-share-gains-and-non-residential-strength-will-support-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how a distributor earns a premium valuation tag? This narrative leans heavily on compounding revenue, thicker margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes real staying power.

Using that approach, future cash flows line up closer to $219 per share, which makes the current $260.66 price appear expensive.

The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.27b. Analysts provide explicit Free Cash Flow estimates for the earlier years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out, with projected Free Cash Flow of $2.89b in 2030. Each of these future cash flows is discounted back to today and added together.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF output suggests an estimated intrinsic value of US$28.51 per share, compared with the recent share price of US$18.36. That gap implies the stock is 35.6% undervalued according to this model. This indicates a meaningful margin between price and estimated value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coupang is undervalued by 35.6%.

It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are willing to pay today for one dollar of current earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E really depends on how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E being reasonable.</p> <p>Coupang is trading on a P/E of 86x. That is well above the Multiline Retail industry average of 19.65x and also above the peer average of 28.99x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Coupang, which is 36.15x, estimates what P/E might be appropriate after considering factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry because it adjusts for those company specific drivers instead of assuming one size fits all. With Coupang’s actual P/E of 86x versus the Fair Ratio of 36.15x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This is a simple way for you to attach a clear story about Coupang’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a set of forecasts and a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to today’s price directly on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where Narratives are updated as new earnings or news arrives and can differ widely. For example, one Coupang Narrative may anchor around a fair value near the lower analyst end of about US$22.80 and another around the upper end near US$40.00. This gives you a structured way to decide how your own view lines up with the market.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coupang? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CPNG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>For dividend-focused investors, Eastman Chemical’s full year update links directly to how dependable its cash returns might be. The company highlighted strong cash generation and again affirmed a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, which continues a multi year pattern of regular payments. At the same time, Simply Wall St’s risk checks point out that the dividend is not well covered by free cash flow and that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. The recent issue of US$600m in 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2031 adds another fixed claim on future cash. Together, those details suggest you may want to look closely at payout ratios, interest costs, and how much cash is left for reinvestment after dividends and debt service.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Eastman Chemical Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on cost reduction, cash generation, and expanding molecular recycling at Kingsport supports the narrative that efficiency and asset utilization can help free up cash to fund both growth projects and dividends.</li> <li>The additional debt and flagged concerns about cash flow coverage could challenge the idea that cost savings alone will keep returns to shareholders comfortable if end market demand stays weak.</li> <li>The fixed income issuance and detailed recycling ramp at Kingsport add extra color on capital structure and sustainability execution that is not fully captured in the high level narrative.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ujv3juw5-commodity-end-markets-and-recycling-initiatives-will-shape-recovery-prospects-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Eastman Chemical</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Profit margins are lower than last year and debt is not well covered by operating cash flow, which could limit room for dividend growth if trading conditions stay soft.</li> <li>⚠️ The dividend is not well covered by free cash flows, so a higher cash commitment to interest on the new 4.50% notes may tighten headroom for future payouts.</li> <li>🎁 Eastman is trading at a discount to one fair value estimate and is viewed as good value compared to peers such as Dow and LyondellBasell, which can be appealing for income investors willing to accept some risk.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow, and cost savings plus Kingsport recycling progress support the idea that free cash flow could improve over time if execution stays on track.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it makes sense to watch three things if you follow Eastman Chemical for income. First, how free cash flow tracks against the dividend and interest costs on the new US$600m notes. Second, whether margins begin to recover toward prior levels, which would give more support to the payout. Third, progress at Kingsport in converting recycling volumes into consistent earnings and cash.

These plants can run consistently, which lines up with the 24/7 needs of hyperscalers and large corporates. The reported 13.9% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of 2025 sits alongside a dividend profile that includes a common dividend with a five year compound annual growth rate of 10.7% and a preferred Series A payout of US$80.00 per share on an annualized basis. That combination suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still writing large checks for acquisitions. For you as an investor, the key question is whether the earnings base from these acquired assets and power contracts can comfortably service higher interest costs, ongoing capital spending, and both common and preferred dividends over time.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Vistra Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The data center driven acquisitions and new power purchase agreements tie directly into the narrative that rising electricity demand and long duration contracts can support revenue growth and EBITDA expansion.</li> <li>Heavier use of acquisitions and fossil fuel assets, plus a higher leverage profile around 3x adjusted EBITDA, echoes the narrative’s caution that debt and regulatory pressure on gas and nuclear could constrain future margins.</li> <li>The recent step up in common and preferred dividends is not fully reflected in the narrative and adds another layer of capital allocation that could influence how much cash is left for renewables and storage projects.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/d88nwa9z-vst-accelerating-power-demand-will-drive-new-nuclear-and-gas-asset-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Vistra</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which could limit financial flexibility if borrowing costs stay high or new projects run over budget.</li> <li>⚠️ Profit margins of 5.6% compared to 11.4% last year indicate pressure on profitability, which may matter if power prices or plant availability move against Vistra.</li> <li>🎁 Vistra is assessed as trading at a large discount to one estimate of fair value, which some investors may see as providing a margin of safety if the thesis on data center demand plays out.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow 24.84% per year, so if acquisitions and long term contracts perform as planned, the current investment and dividend strategy could be supported by a rising earnings base.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how quickly the newly acquired natural gas and nuclear plants are integrated, what returns Vistra reports on that US$4b outlay, and how stable EBITDA looks as more data center contracts come online. Keep an eye on leverage and interest coverage, because more acquisitions or higher dividends could stretch the balance sheet if power markets turn less favorable.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Kering (ENXTPA:KER) is reshaping its brand portfolio as Gucci works through a reset in its positioning and product offering.</li> <li>The group is putting more emphasis on labels such as Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta while broader luxury demand shows signs of cooling.</li> <li>This shift marks an important phase for Kering as it adjusts to changing consumer patterns in key luxury markets.</li> </ul> <p>Kering, through brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, is a major player in global luxury fashion and accessories. With Gucci facing a reset, the group is looking more closely at how each house contributes to its overall profile at a time when demand for high end products is less buoyant than in recent years.</p> <p>For you as an investor, the focus now is on how Kering balances Gucci’s turnaround efforts with the growing visibility of its other brands. The way the group allocates attention and resources across its portfolio could influence its resilience to changes in consumer spending in its core regions.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-ker/kering-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kering</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

As Gucci works through a repositioning, management is effectively asking the rest of the portfolio to carry more weight. For you, the key question is whether houses like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta can deepen their identity without diluting group focus or stretching creative and operational resources at a time when luxury demand is less buoyant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kering Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The increased emphasis on multiple houses lines up with the narrative of product refreshes and store optimization. These are aimed at sharpening brand positioning and improving operating leverage over time.</li> <li>Execution risk at Gucci and other brands, already highlighted in the narrative, is reinforced by this reset. More creative shifts and portfolio changes raise the chance that some collections or market bets do not resonate with consumers.</li> <li>The current news focuses on brand mix and positioning, while the narrative also points to factors like tourism trends and secondhand luxury, which may not be fully reflected in how investors interpret this reset.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/14mdfsvn-ker-beauty-unit-sale-and-licensing-deal-will-shape-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kering</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around Gucci’s repositioning and other creative shifts, which could affect demand if new collections do not connect with core and aspirational buyers.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that Kering’s interest payments are not well covered by earnings. This can limit flexibility if trading conditions stay soft or turn weaker.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts expect earnings to grow strongly over the coming years. This suggests upside if Kering’s portfolio reset and cost discipline play out as planned.</li> <li>🎁 A stronger role for brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta could reduce reliance on a single label and help Kering compete more evenly with peers such as LVMH and Hermès.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Gucci’s refreshed positioning shows up in product traction, pricing, and brand heat, especially with US aspirational shoppers. You can also track whether Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and other houses gain more visibility in key regions without eroding Kering’s overall margin profile. Competitive moves from large groups like LVMH and Richemont on pricing, store openings, and marketing will give extra context for how Kering’s choices are landing with luxury consumers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Kering, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/ENXTPA/KER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Kering</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is reported at about US$699 million. Simply Wall St then extends this with cash flow projections out to 2035, starting with an estimate of US$663.2 million in 2026 and US$743.3 million in 2035, with intermediate years in between. Analysts typically provide forecasts for up to five years, so the later years are extrapolated from earlier trends.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$197.14 per share. With the recent share price at US$755.43, this particular model implies the stock is very expensive relative to its cash flow estimate, with an intrinsic discount indicating it is about 283.2% above the DCF value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ubiquiti may be overvalued by 283.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ubiquiti.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Ubiquiti Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Ubiquiti, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you are paying directly to the earnings the business is currently generating.</p> <p>What counts as a normal or fair P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower one.</p> <p>Ubiquiti currently trades on a P/E of 51.45x. That sits above the Communications industry average P/E of about 40.47x, yet below the peer group average of 77.85x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 36.24x for Ubiquiti, which is an estimate of the P/E that would fit its specific earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific qualities instead of assuming that all businesses in a sector should trade at similar multiples.</p> <p>Comparing Ubiquiti’s actual P/E of 51.45x with the Fair Ratio of 36.24x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These different assumptions can lead to very different fair values and therefore very different views on whether the current US$755.43 price looks attractive or stretched.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ubiquiti? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Pulse Biosciences at around US$19.21 is priced fairly or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article walks through what the numbers indicate about its value.</li> <li>The share price has had a mixed run, with a 24.5% decline over the last week, a 34.1% gain over the last month, a 43.5% gain year to date, a 0.7% decline over the last year, a very large 3 year return of around 7x, and a 30.8% decline over five years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage around Pulse Biosciences has focused on its position in the healthcare space and shifting investor expectations. This helps explain why the share price has moved sharply over different time frames. This context matters, because changing sentiment can affect how investors weigh potential future outcomes against the current share price.</li> <li>Right now, our valuation model gives Pulse Biosciences a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. Next, we will look at how different valuation approaches view the stock, and then finish with a more complete way to think about what that means for you as an investor.</li> </ul> <p>Pulse Biosciences scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

This process arrives at an estimate of what the business might be worth now.</p> <p>For Pulse Biosciences, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on projected free cash flows in dollars. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $54.7 million. Analyst and extrapolated estimates in the model show cash flows staying negative in the near term, then turning positive by 2030, with projected free cash flow of $10 million in that year. Further out, the model extends these projections through 2035 using estimated growth rates.</p> <p>After discounting all those projected cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2.62 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $19.21, this DCF output suggests the stock is very expensive relative to the cash flows assumed in the model, or in other words, very overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Pulse Biosciences may be overvalued by 633.7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Pulse Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Pulse Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies that are not yet producing consistent profits, P/B is often more useful than P/E because it compares the share price with the accounting value of net assets rather than earnings that may still be negative or volatile.</p> <p>In general, a higher multiple is easier to justify when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while a lower multiple tends to reflect more modest expectations or higher uncertainty. That is why context matters when you look at any headline ratio.</p> <p>Pulse Biosciences currently trades on a P/B of about 16.19x. This sits above the Medical Equipment industry average P/B of about 2.44x and also above the peer group average of around 3.21x. Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the preferred multiple, which estimates what a reasonable P/B might be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can give a more focused view than a simple comparison with industry or peer averages. In this case, the actual 16.19x P/B sits above the Fair Ratio used in the model, which points to the shares trading on a richer multiple than that framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you write your own story for Pulse Biosciences by linking your expectations for revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast, a fair value and a clear comparison of that fair value with today’s price. This is all within an easy Community tool that millions of investors use, and that automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might set a higher fair value around US$30 based on a very optimistic view of thyroid and cardiac adoption, while another might use a lower fair value around US$22 based on more moderate assumptions. You can immediately see how far each view sits from the current price to help you decide what you want to do.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Pulse Biosciences? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/PLSE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
