The latest wider-than-expected quarterly loss keeps the near term risk centered on cash burn and execution, while the main catalyst is still whether CleanSpark can convert its power footprint into signed, revenue-generating AI data center leases. This update reinforces that tension but does not fundamentally change it.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is management’s progress on securing AI data center leases tied to its Texas power footprint, highlighted again with this quarter’s results. This matters because it links existing mining infrastructure and power access to a potential new revenue stream in AI and HPC, directly related to the current investor focus. If those leases materialize on reasonable terms, they could become the key short term proof point for the entire pivot.</p> <p>Yet beneath the AI story, investors should still be aware of how exposed CleanSpark remains to Bitcoin price volatility and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-clsk/cleanspark/u7vzh41w-analysts-boost-cleanspark-price-target-highlighting-growth-catalysts-and-improved-profit-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on CleanSpark (it's free!)</a></p><p>CleanSpark's narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $319.0 million earnings by 2028.

The Starwood partnership directly supports that shift by tying future growth to large, power‑rich campuses that can serve both bitcoin and AI customers, which may become a key near term catalyst. At the same time, the biggest risk remains execution and capital intensity as MARA retools sites while still being exposed to bitcoin‑driven earnings swings.</p> <p>The Starwood agreement also interacts with MARA’s pending Q4 2025 results, where analysts were already watching for updates on diversification beyond mining. Against that backdrop, the recently announced US$850,000,000 convertible notes offering is especially relevant, since it highlights how much funding this transition could require and why dilution and leverage are important short term watchpoints alongside the promise of AI‑aligned data centers.</p> <p>But while the upside story is clear, investors should also be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-mara/mara-holdings/rieem6ia-mara-expanding-industry-leadership-will-drive-long-term-sector-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MARA Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>MARA Holdings' narrative projects $1.1 billion revenue and $31.5 million earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether E.ON is fairly priced or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article will walk you through what the current share price might actually represent.</li> <li>E.ON's share price recently closed at €19.77, with returns of 6.3% over 7 days, 12.1% over 30 days, 20.1% year to date and 66.8% over 1 year, as well as 119.6% over 3 years and 193.2% over 5 years, which many investors will want to put into context.</li> <li>Recent coverage around E.ON has focused on its position as a large European utility, its role in energy transition themes and ongoing interest from income focused investors following the stock's long term track record in the sector. Together, these narratives help frame why the share price performance figures might look the way they do.</li> <li>E.ON currently has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>, meaning it screens as undervalued on only 1 of 6 checks.

The implied long run dividend growth rate is capped at 1.73%, even though the underlying input growth estimate is 3.39%. That cap is intended to keep the assumptions conservative and aligned with what may be sustainable over time.</p> <p>Using these inputs, the DDM outputs an intrinsic value of roughly €18.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of €19.77, this implies the stock screens as about 7.2% overvalued on this model. This is a relatively small gap and is well within the range where interest rate or dividend assumptions can easily shift the result.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>E.ON is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dividend Discount Model (DDM)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you see how many euros the market is willing to pay for each euro of annual profit.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company's growth outlook and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to line up with a lower P/E.</p> <p>E.ON is currently trading on a P/E of 17.21x. That is below the Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.20x but above the peer group average of 16.26x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for E.ON is 7.16x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable given factors like the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio directly incorporates those company specific drivers, it offers a more tailored yardstick than simple peer or industry comparisons. The current P/E of 17.21x is well above the Fair Ratio of 7.16x, which indicates that the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about E.ON, linked directly to a forecast for its revenue, earnings and margins, and then to your own view of fair value. All of this is captured in an easy tool on Simply Wall St's Community page that compares your fair value to the live share price, updates automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive, and lets different investors express very different views. For example, one Narrative might lean toward the higher analyst fair value of about €18.30 with stronger long term assumptions, while another might sit closer to the lower analyst price target of €14.00 with more cautious expectations.

The latest Topicus.com update, with acquisition-driven revenue growth and a jump in quarterly earnings but a hit to full-year profit from the Asseco Poland S.A. accounting charge, reinforces that Constellation’s story is increasingly tied to complex deal-making rather than smooth headline numbers. In the short term, that likely sharpens the focus on the upcoming Q4 2025 results as a catalyst, particularly around how management explains one-off items and the returns they expect from large equity stakes. It also nudges the risk profile a bit higher around balance sheet flexibility, integration execution and earnings volatility, even if the market reaction so far suggests no dramatic change to the core thesis.</p> However, one key balance sheet risk linked to acquisition intensity is easy to overlook and investors should be aware of it.\n\nConstellation Software's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c7251dc1-43e4-4b4d-943d-ec40ff5f4adc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Nineteen Simply Wall St Community members see fair value anywhere between about CA$3,333 and CA$7,927, underscoring how far apart individual views can be.

Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.</a></p> <p>The lawsuits around ENTRA1 hit the core of how NuScale plans to turn its Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved small modular reactor design into actual projects. Plaintiffs claim NuScale entrusted commercialization and large capital commitments to a partner with no meaningful nuclear track record, while paying ENTRA1 about US$495 million tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority agreement. That sits next to a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million on sales of US$31.48 million and a new US$1b at the market equity offering filing, so legal uncertainty is landing at the same time as heavy cash usage and potential dilution. The recent Romanian approval shows the technology is still finding willing counterparties, but Fluor’s intention to exit and multiple law firms pursuing securities cases add questions around governance and disclosure. For you as an investor, the key issue is whether project partners, regulators and capital providers remain comfortable backing NuScale while these claims work through the courts, which can take years and could involve settlements, higher costs or tighter oversight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The NuScale Power Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The Romanian SMR project approval aligns with the narrative that NuScale’s NRC certified design and partnerships can eventually support commercial deployment and potential future revenue from projects like RoPower.</li> <li>The ENTRA1 focused lawsuits directly challenge the narrative’s reliance on that partner to drive commercialization and funding, and highlight that this dependency could be a key execution weak point.</li> <li>The size and structure of the ENTRA1 payments, along with the follow on US$1b equity filing, may not be fully captured in earlier narrative assumptions about funding sources and cash runway.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/64bqs928-smr-landmark-us-nuclear-agreement-will-shape-commercialization-path-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NuScale Power</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Multiple securities class actions focused on ENTRA1 disclosures could lead to legal costs, management distraction and potential settlements.</li> <li>⚠️ A US$1b follow on equity program, very large ENTRA1 related expenses and Fluor’s planned exit all point to dilution and funding risk that analysts have already flagged.</li> <li>🎁 NuScale holds NRC design approval in an SMR field that includes peers such as TerraPower and GE Hitachi, which supports its position when pitching long term baseload power to utilities and data center customers.</li> <li>🎁 The Romanian SMR investment decision and work with the Tennessee Valley Authority show that there is institutional interest in NuScale’s technology for future nuclear capacity.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, any updates on the ENTRA1 related lawsuits, including motions to dismiss, settlements or regulatory follow up, because these will shape potential financial and disclosure consequences. Second, NuScale’s cash burn, use of the US$1b equity program and any changes in project timing in future results, as the company reported a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million. Third, progress on concrete delivery milestones at the Romanian plant and with the TVA partnership compared with other SMR efforts from players such as Rolls Royce and GE Hitachi. Together, those signals will indicate whether NuScale can keep moving from engineering work to funded projects while managing legal and financing pressures.</p> <p>To stay up to date on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NuScale Power, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/SMR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for NuScale Power</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This caps off a trailing twelve month profile that includes revenue of US$247.1 million and basic EPS of US$0.51 alongside reported earnings growth of 179.5% over the past year. The company has seen revenue rise from US$49.5 million in Q4 2024 to US$68.8 million in Q4 2025, while quarterly EPS has moved from US$0.11 to US$0.18. This sets the backdrop for analyst forecasts that point to earnings growth of 61.82% a year and revenue growth of 18.3% a year as investors focus on how a 3.1% net margin shapes the quality of these

data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>3.1% net margin on US$247.1 million TTM revenue</h2> <ul> <li>Over the trailing twelve months, TWFG generated US$247.1 million in revenue and US$7.7 million in net income, which works out to a 3.1% net margin compared with 1.3% in the prior year period cited in the analysis.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about profit margins rising over time, and the current 3.1% margin gives a concrete starting point:\n    <ul> <li>Analysts referencing this view are working from trailing net income of US$7.7 million on US$247.1 million of revenue, so any future margin expansion would build from this base rather than from the earlier 1.3% level.</li> <li>The contrast between the current single digit margin and the higher margin levels discussed in the narratives makes it easier for you to see how much improvement those scenarios are assuming compared with today.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>TTM EPS moves from loss to US$0.51</h2> <ul> <li>The trailing twelve month EPS moved from a loss of US$0.14 at the start of the period to a positive US$0.51, alongside trailing net income moving from a loss of US$2.5 million to a profit of US$7.7 million in the latest data point.</li> <li>Bulls point to this swing back into profit as evidence that the business model is gaining traction, and the numbers give that argument some support but also set a high bar:\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about earnings reaching US$70.0 million in a few years, while the latest trailing net income in the dataset is US$7.7 million, so the company would need a very large increase in absolute earnings from here to match that view.</li> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 61.8% a year and past TTM growth of about 179.5% highlight how much of the bullish case depends on this recent rebound being repeated or sustained over multiple years.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic investors connect this recent swing in EPS to their long term story for the stock, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"

TWFG Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E of 37.6x versus DCF fair value of US$4.75</h2> <ul> <li>TWFG is trading on a P/E of 37.6x compared with a cited US Insurance industry average of 12.5x and a peer average of 17.6x, while a DCF fair value of US$4.75 sits well below the current share price of US$19.20 and the analyst price target of US$31.57.</li> <li>Critics use this gap to argue the stock price already bakes in a lot of good news, and the valuation numbers give that cautious view some clear anchors:\n    <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of US$4.75 is materially below both the current share price and the analyst target, which supports the bearish claim that cash flow based estimates are less generous than the market and the TTM growth figures.</li> <li>The current 37.6x P/E being roughly 3x the industry average and more than double the peer average ties into the concern that investors are paying a premium for the 61.8% forecast earnings growth and 18.3% forecast revenue growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who focus on those richer valuation multiples and the lower DCF fair value may find the more cautious take on the stock helpful in framing their own expectations,

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$172.9 million in Q4 2024 to US$175 million in Q4 2025, while basic EPS shifted from US$0.01 to a loss of US$0.05 over the same period, which keeps margins front and center for investors assessing how much earnings power is being squeezed.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Summit Hotel Properties.</a> <p>With the latest numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the prevailing narratives around growth, profitability, and risk that investors have been debating over the past year.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Summit Hotel Properties</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8ff4a9e8-2e58-4f90-8a6e-f369c26fb1d1/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Trailing 12 months still in loss territory</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Summit booked US$729.5 million in revenue and a net loss of US$23.6 million, with basic EPS of a US$0.22 loss.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about low new hotel supply and recovering travel as supports for stronger RevPAR and margins. However, the trailing loss and negative margins show that, so far, the company is not capturing enough profitability from that backdrop.\n<ul> <li>Revenue over the last 12 months is broadly similar to the US$731.8 million level cited a year earlier, which contrasts with the view that limited new supply should be driving stronger top line momentum.</li> <li>Analysts also expect revenue to grow around 2% a year while the business stays unprofitable, which keeps the consensus claim of improving margins under pressure until the income statement actually moves back into the black.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly EPS losses and the bullish story</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, every quarter showed a basic EPS loss, ranging from a US$0.01 loss in Q2 2025 to a US$0.11 loss in Q3 2025, compared with a small profit of US$0.01 per share in Q4 2024.</li> <li>Bulls point to potential margin expansion and reduced losses over multiple years, but the run of quarterly EPS losses in 2025 sits awkwardly against that. This suggests the bullish view is leaning heavily on future improvements rather than what is currently visible in the reported numbers.\n<ul> <li>For example, Q3 2025 showed revenue of US$177.1 million with a net loss of US$11.5 million, which does not yet reflect the higher margin story bulls are expecting from cost control and capital recycling.</li> <li>Even in Q2 2025, where the loss narrowed to US$1.6 million on US$192.9 million of revenue, the company still did not produce positive EPS, so investors following the bullish view may want to watch whether that quarter proves repeatable or not.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that limited new hotel supply and higher travel demand could be the turning point for Summit, but the current streak of quarterly EPS losses shows exactly why they see more upside if margins start to move their way. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0a1wloca-urbanization-and-hybrid-work-will-boost-premium-hotel-demand-x6j6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Summit Hotel Properties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap vs DCF and bearish concerns</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at US$4.65 compared with a DCF fair value of about US$6.04, and the P/S ratio of 0.7x sits well below the 4.2x average for Global Hotel and Resort REITs.</li> <li>Bears focus on high leverage, weak interest coverage, and forecasts of earnings declining an average 34.6% a year over the next three years. That combination helps explain why the market price stays below the DCF fair value and well under the US$5.63 analyst target, despite the apparently low P/S multiple.\n<ul> <li>Interest payments are described as not well covered by earnings, which fits with the trailing 12 month net loss of US$23.6 million and keeps financing risk front of mind for cautious investors.</li> <li>With revenue only expected to grow around 2% a year, slower than the 10.4% US market forecast, skeptics can argue that a discount to both the 6.04 DCF fair value and the 5.63 target price is not surprising while profitability and coverage ratios look stretched.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that weak interest coverage and ongoing losses could matter more than the apparent valuation discount, which is why many are watching how quickly earnings and cash coverage improve relative to debt costs. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/p77jwp5c-remote-work-pressures-and-demographic-trends-will-undermine-sunbelt-markets-1ksz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Summit Hotel Properties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Summit Hotel Properties on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of risks and potential rewards feels finely balanced, take a closer look at the figures yourself and decide where you stand.

of US$652.5 million and net income of US$21.3 million.</li> <li>Critics highlight that low and contracting margins could cap earnings power, and the margin move from 3.9% to 3.3% lines up with that concern, \n    <ul> <li>the consensus narrative talks about gross margins around the 5% range and the need to grow higher margin solutions and services, which ties directly to this margin squeeze at the net level</li> <li>at the same time, earnings still grew 17.5% over the past year, so the bearish focus on margin pressure has to be weighed against the fact that profits have continued to rise in absolute terms</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears warn that thin margins and integration risk could limit upside even with earnings growth showing up in the latest numbers. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Climb Global Solutions Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>17.5% Earnings Growth Versus Modest Revenue Trend</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew 17.5% while revenue growth is described as modest at about 1.2% per year in the provided context, with trailing twelve month EPS at US$4.71 on revenue of US$652.5 million.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that adding high growth vendors, expanding internationally and investing in automation can support strong and sustained earnings growth, \n    <ul> <li>the 17.5% trailing earnings growth and roughly 25% per year compound earnings growth over five years are consistent with that bullish view on profit expansion</li> <li>however, the modest 1.2% revenue growth versus a 10.4% US market pace shows that top line momentum is slower than the broader market, which is an important counterpoint for that optimistic storyline</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Mixed Signals From P/E And DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>CLMB trades on a 19.1x P/E with a share price of US$90.03, below the US Electronic industry average of 28.3x but above its peer average of 13.5x, and well under a DCF fair value of about US$208.35 and an analyst price target of US$133.00.</li> <li>What stands out in the bullish argument is the gap between current price and value estimates, \n    <ul> <li>supporters can point to the roughly 56.8% difference between the US$90.03 share price and the DCF fair value of about US$208.35 as evidence that the market is not fully reflecting trailing earnings growth of 17.5%</li> <li>yet the fact that CLMB trades richer than peers on P/E at 19.1x versus 13.5x means skeptics can argue that some of that growth is already acknowledged, even if the stock is cheaper than the broader industry and below the US$133.00 analyst target</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls argue that the wide gap to DCF fair value and earnings track record could matter more than the premium to peers. <a

Full size SUVs are an important part of GM's product mix, and any safety issue in this segment can influence how customers think about the brand and its quality controls.</p> <p>How GM handles communication with drivers, dealers, and regulators on this recall may shape perceptions of its operational discipline and risk management. As you watch NYSE:GM, this kind of safety event can be one factor among many that you may weigh alongside product strategy, balance sheet strength, and broader auto industry conditions.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-gm/general-motors/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Motors</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are looking at OceanFirst Financial and wondering whether its current share price lines up with its underlying worth, you are asking the exact question this article is built to tackle.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$19.04, with returns of 3.8% over the past 30 days, 6.7% year to date, and 12.8% over the past year. The 3 year and 5 year returns sit at a 5.6% decline and a 5.0% gain respectively.</li> <li>These share price moves sit against a backdrop of ongoing sector wide attention on US regional banks, with investors watching how balance sheets and funding profiles hold up compared to peers. Recent coverage has focused on how smaller banks are positioned within the broader financial sector. This helps frame how a bank like OceanFirst Financial might be assessed by the market.</li> <li>On our checks, OceanFirst Financial has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>.

It focuses on what the bank earns on its equity relative to its cost of equity.</p> <p>For OceanFirst Financial, the model uses a Book Value of US$28.97 per share and a Stable EPS of US$1.62 per share, based on the median return on equity from the past 5 years. The Average Return on Equity is 6.26%, compared with a Cost of Equity of US$2.18 per share. This setup leads to an Excess Return of US$0.56 per share and a Stable Book Value of US$25.85 per share, which is based on weighted future book value estimates from three analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$14.69 per share. Against the recent share price of US$19.04, this implies the stock is around 29.6% overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests OceanFirst Financial may be overvalued by 29.6%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for OceanFirst Financial.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: OceanFirst Financial Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable bank like OceanFirst Financial, the P/E ratio is a practical way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger earnings growth or see lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more muted or risks feel higher.</p> <p>OceanFirst Financial currently trades on a P/E of 16.28x. That sits above the Banks industry average P/E of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.76x, so the market is currently paying a higher price for its earnings than these broad reference points suggest.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might make sense for OceanFirst Financial specifically, given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is 26.69x, which is materially higher than the current 16.28x. On this view, the shares appear undervalued relative to what the model suggests could be a more company specific P/E level.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St these Narratives live on the Community page, where millions of investors can set a fair value and compare it with the current price to help frame buy or sell decisions. They can then see that view update automatically as new news or earnings come in. For OceanFirst Financial, one investor might build a Narrative around the higher US$22.75 price target with stronger revenue and margin assumptions, while another anchors on the US$18.50 target with more conservative expectations, and both can see in real time how their story, numbers and fair value stay aligned with the latest information.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OceanFirst Financial? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/OCFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For a tanker owner with $294.82m of revenue and earnings that include large one off items, this kind of sales multiple can reflect expectations that current conditions in shipping will support stronger profitability than recent reported margins suggest.</p> <p>Against peers, the gap is clear. The company trades at a 3.9x P/S ratio, while the US Oil and Gas industry average is 1.7x. In other words, the stock is priced at more than double that reference point. Our fair P/S ratio estimate is 0.7x, implying a level the market could move toward if expectations for Nordic American Tankers were to line up with that fair ratio framework.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nordic American Tankers</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 3.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh risks such as revenue falling 4.9% year on year and the current P/S multiple resetting if shipping conditions or earnings prove less supportive.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nordic American Tankers narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Points to a Very Different Price</h2> <p>Our DCF model paints a sharper contrast.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Geely Automobile Holdings is attractively priced or not, this article will walk you through what the current share price might be implying about its value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at HK$16.31, with a 7 day return of 4.3% decline, a 30 day return of 1.3% decline, a year to date return of 10.4% decline, a 1 year return of 12.4% decline and a 3 year return of 66.1% alongside a 5 year return of 27.7% decline. This gives a mixed picture for investors weighing recent weakness against longer term performance.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Geely has focused on its position in the Hong Kong auto sector and how sentiment has shifted between traditional and newer energy vehicle makers. This helps frame these share price moves. Longer term discussions in the press about competition, regulation and consumer demand for different vehicle types also sit in the background for anyone trying to judge whether the current level makes sense.</li> <li>Right now Geely holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a> on our checks.

The latest twelve month free cash flow sits at about CN¥5.9b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2027, with CN¥31.5b projected for 2026 and CN¥33.7b for 2027, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to 2035, reaching a projected free cash flow of CN¥45.4b in that year.</p> <p>When all these projected cash flows are discounted back using the DCF model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at HK$45.24 per share. Compared with the recent share price of HK$16.31, this suggests the stock is 63.9% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Geely Automobile Holdings is undervalued by 63.9%.

This can be more meaningful than looking at revenue or assets alone.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on what the market thinks about a company’s earnings growth and risk. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Geely currently trades on a P/E of 9.41x. That sits below the Auto industry average of 19.30x and also below the peer group average of 10.79x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Geely is 11.12x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable after considering factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk. It can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for Geely’s own characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 9.41x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 11.12x, the shares appear undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b88141a8-605a-48f8-a2ba-1abfcf0c9a7d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.
