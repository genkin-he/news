With Gucci facing a reset, the group is looking more closely at how each house contributes to its overall profile at a time when demand for high end products is less buoyant than in recent years.</p> <p>For you as an investor, the focus now is on how Kering balances Gucci’s turnaround efforts with the growing visibility of its other brands. The way the group allocates attention and resources across its portfolio could influence its resilience to changes in consumer spending in its core regions.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-ker/kering-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kering</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

As Gucci works through a repositioning, management is effectively asking the rest of the portfolio to carry more weight. For you, the key question is whether houses like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta can deepen their identity without diluting group focus or stretching creative and operational resources at a time when luxury demand is less buoyant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kering Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The increased emphasis on multiple houses lines up with the narrative of product refreshes and store optimization. These are aimed at sharpening brand positioning and improving operating leverage over time.</li> <li>Execution risk at Gucci and other brands, already highlighted in the narrative, is reinforced by this reset. More creative shifts and portfolio changes raise the chance that some collections or market bets do not resonate with consumers.</li> <li>The current news focuses on brand mix and positioning, while the narrative also points to factors like tourism trends and secondhand luxury, which may not be fully reflected in how investors interpret this reset.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/14mdfsvn-ker-beauty-unit-sale-and-licensing-deal-will-shape-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kering</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around Gucci’s repositioning and other creative shifts, which could affect demand if new collections do not connect with core and aspirational buyers.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that Kering’s interest payments are not well covered by earnings. This can limit flexibility if trading conditions stay soft or turn weaker.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts expect earnings to grow strongly over the coming years. This suggests upside if Kering’s portfolio reset and cost discipline play out as planned.</li> <li>🎁 A stronger role for brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta could reduce reliance on a single label and help Kering compete more evenly with peers such as LVMH and Hermès.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Gucci’s refreshed positioning shows up in product traction, pricing, and brand heat, especially with US aspirational shoppers. You can also track whether Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and other houses gain more visibility in key regions without eroding Kering’s overall margin profile. Competitive moves from large groups like LVMH and Richemont on pricing, store openings, and marketing will give extra context for how Kering’s choices are landing with luxury consumers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Kering, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/ENXTPA/KER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Kering</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

However, the 1 year total shareholder return of 12.20% and very large 5 year total shareholder return suggest longer term holders have still seen strong gains.

The narrative leans heavily on projected earnings growth, future margins and a richer P/E multiple than the sector.</p> <p>Analysts in this narrative apply an 8.63% discount rate to future cash flows and earnings, assume a gentle revenue drift, and still land on a higher earnings base than today. They also build in a future profit multiple that is well above typical metals and mining levels, implying the market would need to pay up for Stanmore Resources if these assumptions hold.</p> <p>Put simply, this most popular view sees today’s share price as leaving a gap to fair value, but that gap depends on those revenue, margin and multiple assumptions playing out over time.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of A$3.20 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6tyv7dqw-indian-urbanization-and-low-capex-projects-will-boost-seaborne-coal-demand-ksp1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this depends on coal prices and regulatory approvals.

These figures raise fair questions about what is already priced in and how risk is being viewed.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Ubiquiti has focused on its role in networking and wireless equipment markets, as investors look for companies with established product ecosystems and recognizable brands. This context helps frame why the stock has attracted attention alongside its recent price performance.</li> <li>On our valuation checks Ubiquiti scores 1 out of 6, indicating it appears undervalued on only one of the six metrics we use.

The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is reported at about US$699 million. Simply Wall St then extends this with cash flow projections out to 2035, starting with an estimate of US$663.2 million in 2026 and US$743.3 million in 2035, with intermediate years in between. Analysts typically provide forecasts for up to five years, so the later years are extrapolated from earlier trends.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$197.14 per share. With the recent share price at US$755.43, this particular model implies the stock is very expensive relative to its cash flow estimate, with an intrinsic discount indicating it is about 283.2% above the DCF value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ubiquiti may be overvalued by 283.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ubiquiti.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Ubiquiti Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Ubiquiti, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you are paying directly to the earnings the business is currently generating.</p> <p>What counts as a normal or fair P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower one.</p> <p>Ubiquiti currently trades on a P/E of 51.45x. That sits above the Communications industry average P/E of about 40.47x, yet below the peer group average of 77.85x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 36.24x for Ubiquiti, which is an estimate of the P/E that would fit its specific earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific qualities instead of assuming that all businesses in a sector should trade at similar multiples.</p> <p>Comparing Ubiquiti’s actual P/E of 51.45x with the Fair Ratio of 36.24x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 21 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Ubiquiti Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your own story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives live inside the Community page and give you a straightforward way to connect what you believe about Ubiquiti’s business to a financial forecast and then to a fair value estimate that you can compare with today’s share price.</p> <p>Because Narratives sit on the platform used by millions of investors, you can see how others frame the same numbers, and the system keeps those Narratives updated when new information such as earnings reports or major news is added, so your fair value view stays current without extra effort.</p> <p>For example, one Ubiquiti Narrative might assume more modest revenue growth and lower long term profit margins, while another might expect stronger growth and higher margins. These different assumptions can lead to very different fair values and therefore very different views on whether the current US$755.43 price looks attractive or stretched.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ubiquiti? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Pulse Biosciences at around US$19.21 is priced fairly or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article walks through what the numbers indicate about its value.</li> <li>The share price has had a mixed run, with a 24.5% decline over the last week, a 34.1% gain over the last month, a 43.5% gain year to date, a 0.7% decline over the last year, a very large 3 year return of around 7x, and a 30.8% decline over five years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage around Pulse Biosciences has focused on its position in the healthcare space and shifting investor expectations. This helps explain why the share price has moved sharply over different time frames. This context matters, because changing sentiment can affect how investors weigh potential future outcomes against the current share price.</li> <li>Right now, our valuation model gives Pulse Biosciences a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. Next, we will look at how different valuation approaches view the stock, and then finish with a more complete way to think about what that means for you as an investor.</li> </ul> <p>Pulse Biosciences scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

This process arrives at an estimate of what the business might be worth now.</p> <p>For Pulse Biosciences, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on projected free cash flows in dollars. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $54.7 million. Analyst and extrapolated estimates in the model show cash flows staying negative in the near term, then turning positive by 2030, with projected free cash flow of $10 million in that year. Further out, the model extends these projections through 2035 using estimated growth rates.</p> <p>After discounting all those projected cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2.62 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $19.21, this DCF output suggests the stock is very expensive relative to the cash flows assumed in the model, or in other words, very overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Pulse Biosciences may be overvalued by 633.7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Pulse Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Pulse Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies that are not yet producing consistent profits, P/B is often more useful than P/E because it compares the share price with the accounting value of net assets rather than earnings that may still be negative or volatile.</p> <p>In general, a higher multiple is easier to justify when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while a lower multiple tends to reflect more modest expectations or higher uncertainty. That is why context matters when you look at any headline ratio.</p> <p>Pulse Biosciences currently trades on a P/B of about 16.19x. This sits above the Medical Equipment industry average P/B of about 2.44x and also above the peer group average of around 3.21x. Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the preferred multiple, which estimates what a reasonable P/B might be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can give a more focused view than a simple comparison with industry or peer averages. In this case, the actual 16.19x P/B sits above the Fair Ratio used in the model, which points to the shares trading on a richer multiple than that framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you write your own story for Pulse Biosciences by linking your expectations for revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast, a fair value and a clear comparison of that fair value with today’s price. This is all within an easy Community tool that millions of investors use, and that automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might set a higher fair value around US$30 based on a very optimistic view of thyroid and cardiac adoption, while another might use a lower fair value around US$22 based on more moderate assumptions. You can immediately see how far each view sits from the current price to help you decide what you want to do.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Pulse Biosciences? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/PLSE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over the past four quarters, the company reported revenue increasing from US$314.7 million in Q4 2024 to US$394.6 million in Q4 2025, while basic EPS moved from US$0.07 to US$0.03. Trailing twelve month EPS stood at a loss of US$0.13, so the latest quarterly profit comes against a year that was still loss making in aggregate.

US$31.5 million, so the business is still absorbing costs even as it scales.</li> <li>Analysts in that consensus view expect revenue growth to continue, yet the current trailing loss means the path from growth to steady profitability is not yet visible in the historical numbers alone.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong revenue and shrinking losses look encouraging, but the fact that the last 12

Zeta Global Holdings.</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation signals: 3.4x P/S and DCF fair value of US$30.27</h2> <ul> <li>Zeta is trading on a P/S of 3.4x compared with a peer average of 5.5x and a US Software average of 3.5x, and the provided DCF fair value of US$30.27 sits above the current share price of US$17.85.</li> <li>Bulls argue that faster earnings growth and margin improvement could justify that gap, and the current data partially lines up with that, but also raises questions:\n    <ul> <li>The bullish view references shrinking losses at about 19.6% per year over five years and strong forecast earnings growth, which ties back to the trailing loss of US$31.5 million being much smaller than the earlier US$120.3 million loss in the dataset.</li> <li>At the same time, with the company still loss making on a trailing basis, the lower P/S and the DCF fair value of US$30.27 versus US$17.85 depend on those future margin gains actually coming through, rather than on current profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these numbers to their upside case, check out how they frame the opportunity in <a

million profit, the trailing twelve month figures still show a basic EPS loss of US$0.13 and total net loss of US$31.5 million, which bearish investors point to when they question the durability of the model.</li> <li>Bears focus on data privacy, client concentration, and heavy tech spend, and the current figures give them some support alongside some pushback:\n    <ul> <li>The ongoing trailing loss and prior quarterly losses of US$21.6 million, US$12.8 million, and US$3.6 million in FY 2025 help skeptics argue that investments in AI and data infrastructure have yet to translate into stable bottom line results.</li> <li>On the other hand, the move from a US$120.3 million loss in an earlier trailing period to US$31.5 million in the latest snapshot suggests the cost base and revenue scale are at least moving closer to the profitability point that bearish forecasts still treat as uncertain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors are asking whether this improving loss profile is

The new 20‑year Google data center deal modestly improves short term visibility around project execution, but the biggest near term swing factor still looks to be AES’s ability to fund its growth pipeline without stretching the balance sheet, especially if financing conditions stay challenging.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the recent decision to maintain the quarterly dividend at about US$0.176 per share is closely tied to this Google announcement. A stable dividend signals confidence in underlying cash generation at a time when AES is committing to long life, capital intensive data center power projects, and it directly intersects with the key catalyst of proving that contracted hyperscale demand can support both reinvestment and ongoing shareholder payouts without adding undue financial strain.</p> <p>But beneath the appeal of a 20‑year Google partnership, investors should be aware of the elevated refinancing and interest rate risk that could…</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nyse-aes/aes/bqus14ac-analyst-commentary-highlights-upgraded-price-target-and-mergers-activity-for-aes-amid-shifting-sector-trends\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on AES (it's free!)</a></p><p>AES' narrative projects $12.0 billion revenue and $1.7 billion earnings by 2028.

The 7 day share price return is 23.17% and the 30 day share price return is 25.42%, while the 1 year total shareholder return of 6.53% contrasts with a 5 year total shareholder return of 69.93%. This suggests longer term holders have experienced stronger results than those who bought more recently.</p> <p>If this update on Data#3 has you reassessing your tech exposure, it could be a good time to look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> picked out by the Simply Wall St screener.</p> <p>So with earnings and dividends moving, but the share price showing weaker recent returns, is Data#3 quietly trading at an attractive entry point, or is the market already paying up for any future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 71.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>According to the most followed narrative on Data#3, a fair value of A$25.40 sits well above the last close of A$7.13, which creates a wide gap between narrative pricing and where the market currently trades.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Data#3's reporting exemplifies ENRON-style disclosure engineering through: 1. Dual metric hierarchies: Promoting non-IFRS gross sales while suppressing GAAP revenue 2. Segment reclassification: Shifting struggling product lines between business units 3. Temporal cash management: Accelerating payables/deerring receivables to window-dress liquidity Investors should demand: * Full inventory aging schedule * Vendor rebate waterfall analysis * State-level P&amp;L disclosures * Cash conversion cycle reconciliation The cumulative effect creates a 230-470bp overstatement of operational health, primarily through inventory valuation, rebate accounting, and geographic risk aggregation. This pattern suggests management anticipates worsening H2 conditions, making current obfuscation practices a leading indicator of future earnings risks.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pasvz7vg-asxdtl-does-it-all-add-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to understand why such aggressive disclosure concerns still sit alongside a much higher fair value?

This raises clear questions about what is priced in around rare disease obesity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals enters late February 2026 as the leader in \"rare disease obesity,\" a niche that has remained remarkably insulated from the broader GLP-1 price wars. The company’s core asset, Setmelanotide, has seen rapid uptake in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and POMC deficiency, where traditional weight-loss drugs often fail.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>It is worth examining how a single rare disease franchise supports that higher fair value.

The recent surge in returns and very low price to earnings multiple are attractive on the surface, but they also sit alongside large one off gains and a fund that generates limited recurring revenue. Saba Capital’s renewed push for a comprehensive strategic review adds a fresh near term catalyst around the discount to net asset value, fee structure, and even the fund’s offshore setup, but it also injects more uncertainty into an already volatile vehicle with a relatively inexperienced board. The activism could prove material, yet it may not change the core reality that ASA’s fortunes remain tightly tied to swings in gold equities.</p> However, one governance risk in particular is something investors should not ignore.\n\nASA Gold and Precious Metals' shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how much higher they are than fair value</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/530981a7-5ecc-48bb-9ea8-c64c17ef3d80/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community currently has 1 fair value estimate around US$42.72, yet recent activism and governance turnover may matter more for ASA’s path than any single model suggests, so you should weigh multiple viewpoints.<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore another fair value estimate on ASA Gold and Precious Metals</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as $42.72!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with this assessment?

The current 31.9% margin alongside trailing EPS of US$12.00 gives some backing to that bullish view, even as:\n    <ul> <li>Same restaurant sales growth in 2025 swung from a 1% decline in Q1 to positive growth of 3.8% and 3.6% in Q2 and Q3, showing mixed traffic trends beneath the margin stability.</li> <li>Net income over the last four quarters moved in a relatively tight range between US$1.9b and US$2.3b, which fits the idea of steady earnings but not rapid acceleration.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>McDonald's Future Earnings Per Share Growth</p> <h2>Store base tops 44,000 with mixed traffic</h2> <ul> <li>Total restaurants increased from 43,756 in Q1 2025 to 44,599 by Q3 2025, while same restaurant sales growth moved from a 1% decline in Q1 to gains of 3.8% in Q2 and 3.6% in Q3.</li> <li>Bears highlight the risk that declining low income traffic and market saturation could pressure U.S. revenues. The swing from a 1.5% decline in same restaurant sales in Q3 2024 to positive mid single digit growth in 2025 supports the idea that traffic is not uniformly weak, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The reliance on higher same restaurant sales growth to support future earnings means any renewed traffic softness could limit how much benefit McDonald's gets from its larger 44,000 plus store base.</li> <li>Concerns about market saturation and franchisee economics remain relevant, because unit growth from 42,819 restaurants in Q3 2024 to 44,599 in Q3 2025 needs to be matched by healthy guest counts to sustain systemwide sales.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Critics who focus on traffic risk may want to see how that concern stacks up against the numbers in the dedicated bear case for McDonald's, which digs into same restaurant sales trends, cost pressures, and unit growth assumptions. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 McDonald's Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Premium valuation above DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$333.01, McDonald's trades at a trailing P/E of 27.6x versus the US Hospitality industry average of 23.2x, sits below the peer average of 55.8x, and is above a DCF fair value estimate of about US$242.21.</li> <li>Supportive investors point to 5 year annual earnings growth of 8.3% and forecast earnings growth of roughly 6.8% per year. Those figures, combined with a 2.23% dividend yield and a 31.9% net margin, heavily support the bullish case that a premium P/E can be justified, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the current share price of US$333.01 and the DCF fair value of about US$242.21 underlines the risk that some buyers are paying above modeled cash flow value.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 5.1% per year is not especially high, so a 27.6x P/E relies on confidence that margins and earnings growth near 6.8% can be maintained.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you're trying to decide whether that premium price tag fits with your own expectations for growth and cash generation, it can help to see how bullish investors frame the long term story around digital, margins, and capital returns in one place. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 McDonald's Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/8bb6ppxs-mcdonalds-a-fundamental-and-historical-valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for McDonald's on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Feeling torn between the bullish and cautious takes here?

The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.27b. Analysts provide explicit Free Cash Flow estimates for the earlier years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out, with projected Free Cash Flow of $2.89b in 2030. Each of these future cash flows is discounted back to today and added together.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF output suggests an estimated intrinsic value of US$28.51 per share, compared with the recent share price of US$18.36. That gap implies the stock is 35.6% undervalued according to this model. This indicates a meaningful margin between price and estimated value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coupang is undervalued by 35.6%. Track this in your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>, or discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">53 more high quality undervalued stocks</a>.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPNG Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPNG Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Coupang.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Coupang Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to relate what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are willing to pay today for one dollar of current earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E really depends on how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E being reasonable.</p> <p>Coupang is trading on a P/E of 86x. That is well above the Multiline Retail industry average of 19.65x and also above the peer average of 28.99x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Coupang, which is 36.15x, estimates what P/E might be appropriate after considering factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry because it adjusts for those company specific drivers instead of assuming one size fits all. With Coupang’s actual P/E of 86x versus the Fair Ratio of 36.15x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This is a simple way for you to attach a clear story about Coupang’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a set of forecasts and a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to today’s price directly on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where Narratives are updated as new earnings or news arrives and can differ widely. For example, one Coupang Narrative may anchor around a fair value near the lower analyst end of about US$22.80 and another around the upper end near US$40.00. This gives you a structured way to decide how your own view lines up with the market.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coupang? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CPNG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
