However, earnings are projected to surge 53.4% per year, far ahead of the US average forecast of 15.7%.

Net profit margin dropped to 11.7% from last year’s 13.7%, and the bottom line was boosted by a one-off CA$290.0 million gain. Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow at 4.1% per year, trailing the Canadian market’s 5%, while earnings are expected to accelerate by 21.3% per year, pacing well ahead of the sector. Investors are weighing this strong growth outlook against a premium 27x P/E ratio as well as notable risks around financial quality, share dilution, and dividend sustainability.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Capital Power.</a> <p>Next up, we’ll see how the headline figures fit alongside the current narratives.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing.

The recently announced joint project with Samsung SDI and BMW is a clear positive for Solid Power’s product validation efforts, potentially accelerating its timeline toward market entry, however, the short-term financial impact and mitigation of its concentration risk are still uncertain.\n</p> <p> Of all recent announcements, the expanded partnership with SK On (expected to generate at least US$50 million in revenue) stands out as a potentially relevant catalyst. This agreement, combined with the Samsung SDI and BMW collaboration, highlights increasing industry traction even as Solid Power faces ongoing cash burn and high capital requirements that could pressure its liquidity if losses persist.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be aware that reliance on a handful of major partners remains a key risk if expectations around commercial adoption or ongoing commitments do not fully materialize...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-sldp/solid-power/v38tuaov-sldp-future-gains-will-be-constrained-by-prolonged-overvaluation-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Solid Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>Solid Power's narrative projects $33.2 million in revenue and $1.6 million in earnings by 2028.

This perspective is underlined by concerns over rising capital requirements and the pace of Equinor’s renewables expansion.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that while Equinor’s low multiple offers immediate value, it may also reflect caution about the sustainability of high dividends as legacy oil and gas fields mature.</li> <li>The consensus also points out that persistent optimism assumes offshore wind and renewables will offset margin pressures.

Ongoing profit growth and new long-term gas contracts could add upside.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus highlights that the fair value premium is only meaningful if projected margin improvements and cash flows from new projects materialize amid regulatory and price risks.</li> <li>This wide discount, combined with moderate analyst price targets near current levels, shows how the market is balancing potential upside with caution about decarbonization and energy transition headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Equinor on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different interpretation of the data?

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 283% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 8.7% per annum over the next three years.  Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 20% each year, which paints a poor picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that SK hynix's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From SK hynix's P/E? </h2><p> Despite SK hynix's shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of SK hynix's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> You always need to take note of risks, for example -<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>SK hynix has 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of SK hynix's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

This approach\n    <ul> <li> drives recurring software revenues with more predictable streams, and\n      </li> <li> contributes to higher EBITDA margins and operational leverage as lower-margin legacy products are phased out.\n      </li> </ul> </li> <li> After these latest numbers, see if the consensus narrative is evolving and whether margin pressure or upside surprises could change the outlook. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full OneSpan Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Future Earnings Projected to Decline Sharply by 2028</h2> <ul> <li> Analyst estimates call for annual earnings to drop from $59.9 million now to $26.1 million by September 2028, as profit margins are forecast to shrink to 9.3% and annual revenue growth slows to 5.3%.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative notes these forecasts highlight both execution risks and ongoing revenue pressure. It emphasizes that\n    <ul> <li> the shift away from hardware and legacy contracts is creating persistent topline headwinds, and\n      </li> <li> reliance on acquisitions plus intense competition may limit organic innovation, challenging the durability of recent gains.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>PE Ratio and DCF Valuation Suggest Potential Upside</h2> <ul> <li> At a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x and a share price of $11.4, OneSpan trades far below its DCF fair value of $23.66 and the US Software industry average P/E of 34.1x.\n  </li> <li> In the analysts' consensus view, this deep discount reflects skepticism about sustaining profitability. However, it leaves the door open for re-rating if execution improves or recurring revenues stabilize faster than expected, because\n    <ul> <li> the consensus price target of $18.50 implies roughly 62% upside from here, even as forecasts anticipate a shrinking bottom line, and\n      </li> <li> positive catalysts like cross-selling and new product innovation could drive a reassessment if current headwinds are overcome.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OneSpan on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own interpretation of the latest figures?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if Nu Holdings is a hidden gem or just another growth story? If you’re curious about whether now is the right time to buy in, you’re not alone.</li> <li>The stock has climbed 51.6% year-to-date and is up 6.1% over the past month, signaling renewed excitement and a possible shift in how investors see its future potential and risks.</li> <li>Recent headlines have spotlighted Nu’s strategic expansion across new Latin American markets and ongoing product launches. This has sparked optimism about its ability to deepen its customer base even as competition intensifies. These developments are fueling speculation that Nu could keep outpacing rivals and capture fresh growth opportunities.</li> <li>Looking at the numbers, Nu Holdings currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a> on our valuation checks for being undervalued, which might surprise some after its run-up. Next, we’ll dig into what this score means, compare common approaches to analyzing valuation, and introduce a smarter way to evaluate whether the stock truly offers value at today’s price.</li> </ul> <p>Nu Holdings scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

Unlike models that focus only on cash flows, this approach centers on the company’s ability to generate “excess” profits from its equity base.</p> <p>For Nu Holdings, the data tells a clear story. The company’s average return on equity is an impressive 29.42%, while its stable book value is estimated at $3.04 per share by six analysts. The stable earnings per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity from nine analysts, stands at $0.90. The cost of equity is $0.36 per share, so the excess return currently generated is $0.53 per share.</p> <p>While strong returns on capital may be a positive sign, the model estimates an intrinsic value that is much lower than today’s price. The Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings is trading at a 76.9% premium to its fair value, which may indicate that the stock is significantly overvalued at present.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings may be overvalued by 76.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 834 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Nu Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Nu Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often viewed as one of the best ways to quickly assess value. The PE multiple captures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings and is especially useful when profits are stable and growing. Higher growth prospects and lower risks typically justify a higher \"normal\" PE ratio. More volatile earnings or higher uncertainties mean investors may expect a lower multiple.</p> <p>Nu Holdings currently trades at a PE ratio of 33.85x. For context, the Banks industry average PE is 11.16x, and its peer group averages 11.48x, suggesting Nu is commanding a significant premium to both benchmarks. This premium usually reflects higher anticipated growth, stronger profitability, or lower perceived risk.</p> <p>Rather than relying solely on these market benchmarks, Simply Wall St introduces the concept of a Fair Ratio, a PE multiple tailored to Nu Holdings' unique profile, including factors like forecast earnings growth, profit margins, industry dynamics, market capitalization, and risk. This approach offers a more individualized, thorough comparison than simple peer or industry averages.</p> <p>Nu Holdings’ Fair Ratio is calculated at 22.69x, meaning the current PE of 33.85x is noticeably higher. This sizeable gap suggests the market is pricing in an ambitious growth scenario that may not be fully supported by the fundamentals as they stand today.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Nu Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, personalized investment story that connects your view of Nu Holdings' future to a concrete forecast of its revenue, profits, and margins. This turns your perspective into an estimate of fair value, not just a gut feeling.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's platform, Narratives are an easy-to-use tool found on the Community page, enabling millions of investors to link real company stories to live financial forecasts and fair value estimates. Narratives allow you to confidently decide when to buy or sell by comparing your assumed fair value (based on your expectations) to the current market price, so you are always investing within your framework.</p> <p>What makes this tool powerful is that Narratives update dynamically as news or earnings releases come in, ensuring your valuation stays current with fresh data. For example, one investor may believe Nu can keep growing fast and assigns a high fair value of $20 per share, while another, more cautious, sees risks from increased competition and values it at $14. Both are using the same Narrative system but very different assumptions.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Nu Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Taiho Kogyo (TSE:6470) swung to profitability this past year, but underlying earnings have been pressured by a 32.3% annual decline over the last five years and a significant one-off loss of ¥1.1 billion in the twelve months to September 30, 2025. The company’s net profit margin has improved recently, even though current profitability is affected by non-recurring losses and the share price of ¥685 trades well above an internal fair value estimate of ¥272.1. Investors may see the return to profit and favorable price-to-sales ratio versus the Japanese auto components sector as encouraging signals, but sustainability of dividends and the impact of non-recurring items remain core issues to watch going forward.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-6470/taiho-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Taiho Kogyo.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline results up against the most widely discussed narratives for Taiho Kogyo, highlighting where market sentiment and fundamentals overlap, and where they might diverge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

This makes the recent margin uptick tricky for bullish investors to celebrate without more evidence.</li> <li>Bulls often focus on the return to profit and margin expansion, but fundamentals suggest that one-off charges remain just as important for a true earnings reset.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Price-to-Sales Lags Sector, but Premium to DCF Fair Value Raises Eyebrows</h2> <ul> <li>Taiho Kogyo trades at 0.2x price-to-sales, lower than the peer average of 0.5x and the broad industry level of 0.4x. This suggests a valuation discount on revenues despite a share price of ¥685 that stands well above the DCF fair value of ¥272.10.</li> <li>Optimists argue the sector-relative discount makes the stock attractive, but\n    <ul> <li>the sizable premium to its own DCF value shows that market sentiment is pricing in a brighter future than fundamentals alone may justify, especially given that past five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3% per year.</li> <li>Peer comparisons favor Taiho Kogyo on a price-to-sales basis. However, the fair value gap reminds value-driven investors to stay alert for a potential reset if future results do not deliver.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Durability in Question as Non-Recurring Losses Continue</h2> <ul> <li>The company’s recent five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3%. Ongoing concerns about dividend sustainability are heightened by non-recurring losses like the recent ¥1.1 billion charge.</li> <li>Supporters point to profit or revenue growth as a reason for optimism, but \n    <ul> <li>reliable dividend payments will likely require not just stable, but sustainably increasing, core profits. This can be challenging when one-off costs remain a drag.</li> <li>Positive sector comparisons may signal some resilience, but fundamental risks around earnings quality and dividend coverage persist until the noise from non-recurring items settles down.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Measured optimism about Taiho Kogyo’s foundation persists, but concrete progress on recurring profitability will matter most for investors watching future payout potential. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-6470/taiho-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Taiho Kogyo.</a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

This creates a runway for double-digit sales increases in fast growth end markets and supports sustained above-GDP revenue growth.

Despite solid historical profitability and high-quality earnings, forward-looking growth rates and recent compression in net margins, paired with a premium valuation, give investors plenty to consider this earnings season.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Kirby.</a> <p>The next section puts Kirby's results head-to-head with the popular market narratives to reveal where expectations line up and where investor assumptions might face new challenges.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Kirby</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/35154fdf-b7c7-4a38-b012-29fc4c0387af/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Analyst Price Target Offers 15.6% Upside to Current Price</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby's share price sits at $104.33, notably below the analyst price target of $120.60, representing potential upside of about 15.6% from current levels if analyst forecasts play out.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that for shares to reach the $120.60 target, Kirby must achieve projected revenue growth averaging 6.1% per year and expand profit margins from 9.3% to 11.4% by 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This scenario assumes earnings climb to $445.6 million over the next four years, matching analysts' expectations for consistent multi-year growth and market share gains.</li> <li>To justify the price target, Kirby would need to trade at a forward PE of 16.5x in 2028, which is nearly double the industry average of 8.4x. This suggests ongoing investor confidence in its premium positioning and strategic tailwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Consensus narrative says Kirby’s numbers have to keep stacking up.

Even if Kirby meets earnings targets, its shares need to hold above today’s sector-wide valuation to fulfill upward price expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Industry Tailwinds vs. Market Growth Rates</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby’s revenue is forecast to grow at 4.8% per year, which lags significantly behind the broader US market’s expected 10.3% annual revenue growth. This is a sign its end-markets remain solid but are not keeping pace with wider economic sectors.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that limited vessel supply, data center investment, and U.S. manufacturing reshoring may help Kirby maintain steady utilization and revenue visibility despite softer chemical demand.\n    <ul> <li>Offsetting these strengths, the consensus view cautions that Kirby’s dependence on the petrochemical market, ongoing cost pressures, and limited international diversification could constrain top-line expansion and earnings stability if the US economic cycle weakens.</li> <li>This tension means that even with powerful industry trends at its back, Kirby’s outlook is inevitably tied to the health of cyclical chemical demand and capital expenditures by US industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Kirby on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you have a unique perspective on Kirby’s results?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.  That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least.     </p><p> After losing 3.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at a standout 35.9%, recent short-term share price gains suggest investor optimism is building on improved profit expectations, even though there has been more modest performance over the past three years.</p> <p>If Koei Tecmo’s surge piqued your interest, this is a great time to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Koei Tecmo's shares rallying on upgraded guidance and optimism running high, investors now face the crucial question: Is the current price reflecting all this good news, or does an undervalued opportunity remain for future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 19.8x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Koei Tecmo Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.8x, which is lower than both its industry peers and fair value benchmarks. With the last close at ¥2,080.5, this signals potential undervaluation relative to comparable entertainment companies in Japan.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay now for every ¥1 of earnings the company generates. This metric is especially relevant for entertainment sector stocks, where future profit visibility can fluctuate and often commands a premium.</p> <p>The company’s 19.8x P/E is below the Japanese Entertainment industry average of 21.6x as well as the peer average of 26.9x. Compared to the estimated fair P/E ratio of 25.2x, Koei Tecmo shares could be attractively priced should the market re-rate its future profits upwards.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/media/tse-3635/koei-tecmo-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Koei Tecmo Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 19.8x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower-than-expected revenue growth or unexpected market volatility could pose challenges to the current optimism and affect Koei Tecmo’s valuation in the future.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/media/tse-3635/koei-tecmo-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Koei Tecmo Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Gives a Different Signal</h2> <p>While the current price-to-earnings ratio presents Koei Tecmo Holdings as undervalued when compared to peers and industry norms, our DCF model provides a different perspective.

The recent announcement of stronger-than-expected interim results, a raised full-year earnings forecast, and a substantial 36% interim dividend increase signals that key short-term catalysts, like steady end-market demand and effective cost controls, have become more pronounced. These upgrades suggest that profitability momentum is stronger than earlier analysis indicated. Previous risks centered around external threats such as US tariffs and margin pressure from slow revenue growth now appear somewhat diminished, at least in the near term, as the latest results point to solid operational execution and less impact from geopolitical headwinds than first feared. However, valuation remains a concern, with the current share price trading above consensus fair value and a price-to-earnings ratio well above industry averages, which keeps expectations high.</p> But valuation risk could still catch some investors off guard, especially after recent share gains.\n\nSumitomo Electric Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 12%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c5fdbcb3-b869-47ae-bfdc-127d4419245a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Among the Simply Wall St Community, two retail investors estimate fair values for Sumitomo Electric Industries between ¥2,499,690 and ¥4,808,560.

The recent share buyback announcement confirms management's willingness to prioritize shareholder value with a substantial repurchase program running until late 2026. While this move sends a positive signal and may provide some short-term support to the share price, the primary catalysts remain upcoming earnings releases and the ability to maintain or accelerate profit growth, especially after the slight deceleration seen in recent years. At the same time, risks like a relatively high Price-To-Earnings ratio compared to the sector, a dividend track record that remains unstable, and frequent board changes continue to warrant close attention. The buyback could help counter some valuation concerns but doesn’t fully resolve underlying business challenges. \n\nOn the other hand, board stability remains an issue that shouldn’t be overlooked by investors.</p> Niterra's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 31%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5334/niterra-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5334/niterra-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5334 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/fad2c8c7-9a7b-41a4-9853-068f081d3adf/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5334 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> From the Simply Wall St Community, one retail investor currently pegs Niterra’s fair value at ¥5,680.5, reflecting a single consensus.

This creates both risk if catalysts disappoint and opportunity if operational efficiency or new markets exceed expectations.\n    <ul> <li>The consensus target being so close to the current price suggests the market broadly agrees on fair value based on expected earnings and margin trends, but leaves little near-term upside for new investors at these valuations.</li> <li>This profile spotlights the key tension: strong historical growth and defensive characteristics justify some premium, but further expansion and margin improvement will need to materialize to support continued share appreciation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For a deeper dive into how analysts size up PriceSmart’s future, compare the consensus narrative with performance inside and outside its core markets. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/klyf8sv7-club-rollout-and-chile-expansion-will-unlock-new-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full PriceSmart Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/klyf8sv7-club-rollout-and-chile-expansion-will-unlock-new-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for PriceSmart on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different take on the figures?
