Over the past few quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$462.3 million in Q1 2025 to US$496.7 million in Q3 2025 before ending the year at US$487.7 million, while basic EPS losses ranged between roughly US$0.00 and US$0.10 across the same period.

Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Losses Widen Again To US$49.3 Million In Q4</h2> <ul> <li>Net income from ongoing operations moved from a loss of US$1.3 million in Q1 2025 to a loss of US$49.3 million in Q4 2025, even though quarterly revenue sat in a fairly tight band between US$462.3 million and US$496.7 million over the same period.</li> <li>Critics in the bearish camp focus on this pattern, arguing that a business which is reporting US$1.9b in trailing 12 month revenue but a US$85.5 million trailing loss is still highly exposed to rising medical and pharmacy costs and may need more external funding, and the step up in quarterly losses during 2025 keeps that concern very much alive.\n    <ul> <li>Bears point to the combination of ongoing GAAP losses and a cash runway of under one year as evidence that profitability is not yet resilient even after several years of reported loss reduction.</li> <li>They also highlight that higher benefit expense ratios and elevated utilization, if they continue, would leave limited room to absorb further shocks without either deeper cost cuts or new capital.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are worried about how these Q4 losses fit with the cautious view, it is worth seeing how skeptics frame the longer term picture in their dedicated bear case for the stock: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f7z0cpk1-rising-costs-and-regulation-will-erode-medicare-advantage-profitability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Clover Health Investments Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Trailing US$1.9b Revenue Supports Bullish Scale Story</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Clover Health generated US$1.9b of revenue with a loss of US$85.5 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.17, compared with US$1.4b of trailing revenue and a US$46.3 million loss at the same point a year earlier, so the business today is larger in dollar terms but still loss making.</li> <li>The bullish narrative leans heavily on this growing revenue base, arguing that a 15% trailing growth rate and reported 34.3% annual loss reduction over five years set up a path to profitability as operating leverage from the Medicare Advantage book and the Clover Assistant platform is realized.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point out that analysts expect earnings to turn positive over the coming years and see trailing loss levels as manageable relative to revenue scale, especially if margins move from roughly minus low single digits to positive territory as forecasts suggest.</li> <li>They also note that management and bullish analysts both talk about membership and revenue expansion, and see the current loss run rate of US$85.5 million on US$1.9b of revenue as a thinner gap to close than in earlier years reflected in the five year loss reduction rate.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls argue this revenue base could be the springboard for the kind of margin shift they are expecting, so if you want to see how that story is built out in full, the dedicated bull case narrative is a helpful next stop: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/85jogae9-digital-healthcare-and-medicare-advantage-will-unlock-long-term-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Clover Health Investments Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Cheap P/S Of 0.6x Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Clover Health is currently valued on a P/S of 0.6x compared with an average of 1.3x for the wider US healthcare industry and 1.9x for closer peers, while the current share price of US$2.09 sits against an allowed analyst target reference of US$3.15, which implies potential upside if that target were reached.</li> <li>Where bulls and bears differ is how they weigh that low P/S and potential upside against a cash runway of under one year and ongoing losses, so the same set of numbers can look like a value opportunity or a value trap depending on which risk is viewed as most important.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls see the 0.6x P/S multiple and trailing 15% revenue growth as a sign the stock is priced below other healthcare names relative to its sales, especially if earnings turn positive as some forecasts suggest.</li> <li>Bears counter that a cash runway of less than a year keeps the door open to future capital raises, which could dilute existing holders and limit how much benefit shareholders actually see from any improvement in operations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see

Having a Head of Research and Communications with a media and research background can help the company explain complex crypto concepts in plain language, which matters if it wants to speak credibly to both retail investors and institutions. For you as an investor, the key question is whether Ehrlich can translate his journalistic experience into consistent, high quality research content that supports Sharplink’s mission of providing what it calls smarter access to the long term Ethereum opportunity. His prior roles suggest he is used to functioning as a public face, so you may see more commentary, reports, and educational output tied directly to Sharplink’s brand. That can influence how the story is framed versus other Ethereum related products in the market, and how comfortable different audiences feel engaging with the company’s tools and data.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ The company has a history of shareholder dilution over the past year, which can weigh on existing holders if equity issuance continues.</li> <li>⚠️ The share price has been more volatile than the broader US market over the past 3 months, which may not suit investors with lower risk tolerance.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts currently expect very large earnings growth, which, if achieved, could reshape how the market views Sharplink’s long term potential.</li> <li>🎁 A communications lead with deep digital asset experience may help Sharplink better articulate its Ethereum focus to both institutional and retail audiences.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Sharplink’s external communication style changes and whether new research output appears that is clearly tied to Ehrlich’s remit. Pay attention to updated investor materials, thought pieces on Ethereum and crypto market structure, and any data products or reports that carry his name. You can also track whether management references this new role on future conference calls or presentations, particularly around how Sharplink plans to grow its retail and institutional user base for Ethereum related access.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Uber Technologies is priced attractively right now, you are not alone. A closer look at its current valuation can help you decide how it fits into your portfolio.</li> <li>Uber shares last closed at US$75.42, with returns of 2.1% over the past 7 days, a 5.5% decline over 30 days, a 9.0% decline year to date, a 0.8% decline over 1 year, a 118.2% gain over 3 years and a 35.8% gain over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent headlines around Uber have continued to focus on its role as a major player in app based mobility and delivery, as well as ongoing debates about ride hailing regulation and the treatment of drivers across key markets. Together, these themes help frame how investors are thinking about Uber's long term business profile and the risks that could be priced into the stock today.</li> <li>On our checks, Uber currently scores a valuation rating of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in your hands right now.</p> <p>For Uber Technologies, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $9.79b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates see Free Cash Flow figures in the $10b to $23.56b range over the next decade, with Simply Wall St extending projections beyond the initial analyst window.</p> <p>Pulling all those cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$171.19 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$75.42, this output suggests the stock is 55.9% below that estimated intrinsic value according to this specific set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Uber Technologies is undervalued by 55.9%.

You can think of it as how many dollars investors are currently willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a reasonable P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Uber currently trades on a P/E of 15.44x. That sits below the Transportation industry average of 37.54x and the peer average of 29.00x, which might initially suggest a lower market multiple than many comparable names. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Uber is 23.12x, which is its view of the P/E that could be appropriate given factors such as Uber’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>The Fair Ratio can be more informative than a straight comparison with peers or broad industry averages because it attempts to adjust for those company specific factors rather than assuming all firms deserve the same multiple.

Narratives make those differences transparent and easy to compare so you can see which story aligns most closely with your own view before you act.</p> <p>For Uber Technologies however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Uber Technologies Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/0fpb8nh8-uber-expanding-driverless-rides-will-accelerate-market-leadership-over-rivals?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Uber Technologies Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$104.47 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value versus the last close of US$75.42: about 28%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used in this narrative: 12.93% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on a growing user base across Mobility and Delivery, with cross platform integration and membership products like Uber One aimed at lifting spend per customer and retention.</li> <li>Sees long term earnings power supported by autonomous and electric partnerships, higher margin services such as advertising and loyalty, and ongoing use of AI to improve efficiency.</li> <li>Flags meaningful risks around capital heavy autonomous investments, regulatory and insurance costs, competition in both ride hailing and AVs, and the impact of lower margin products on profitability.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/9bpnrqjk-uber-expanding-autonomous-ride-hailing-with-waymo?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Uber Technologies Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this cautious narrative: US$72.92 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value versus the last close of US$75.42: about 3%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used in this narrative: 13.05% per year</p> <ul> <li>Highlights how ride hailing, Uber Eats and freight are all important, but sees intense competition, possible price pressure and market saturation as constraints on profitability.</li> <li>Emphasises ongoing regulatory and legal risks, including driver classification, safety and local operating rules, which could raise costs and limit flexibility.</li> <li>Assumes a higher future P/E multiple of 44.72x, while questioning whether that valuation is justified once the business matures and the market focuses more on sustainable earnings.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how your own view compares with these, you can use the full Community Narratives to adjust the revenue, margin and valuation assumptions to match your expectations for Uber and see how your fair value stacks up against the current share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Uber Technologies? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UBER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UBER 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/57147e6d-cf28-4e13-b807-86a31e002d9b/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UBER 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

It is often used for early stage or loss making businesses where earnings are not yet meaningful. For a clinical stage biotech with no revenue and ongoing losses, a higher P/B can reflect how investors are weighing the company’s pipeline, expected future cash flows, and funding needs against its current balance sheet.</p> <p>Here, Cogent’s 11.4x P/B is described as good value relative to its peer average of 19.1x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock at a discount to similar names focused on comparable areas. At the same time, the same 11.4x is described as expensive versus the wider US biotechs industry average of 2.7x, meaning investors are currently assigning a much richer valuation than they are to the sector overall.</p> <p>Result: Price-to-Book of 11.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh the pipeline and valuation against clinical trial uncertainty and the ongoing net loss of US$328.937 million with no current revenue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Cogent Biosciences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If you are weighing the mix of strong past returns and a significant net loss, take a moment to review the key data and form your own view, including the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 3 important warning signs</a> that highlights what the market currently sees on both the risk and reward side.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If Cogent has you thinking more broadly about your portfolio, do not stop here, there are other stocks and themes worth putting on your radar right now.</p> <ul> <li>Target potential mispricings by scanning companies that look attractively valued on key fundamentals using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> before the crowd turns its attention to them.</li> <li>Strengthen your income stream by reviewing companies with higher yields and resilient payouts through the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15 dividend fortresses</a> so you are not relying on capital gains alone.</li> <li>Prioritise resilience by focusing on businesses with robust finances and consistent metrics via the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_solid_balance_sheet\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solid balance sheet and fundamentals stocks screener (39 results)</a>, rather than leaving your capital tied to weaker balance sheets.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over a longer stretch, a 26.2% 1 year total shareholder return and 53.0% 5 year total shareholder return indicate that investors who stayed invested through recent capital raises and earnings movements have, so far, been rewarded.</p> <p>If the AI linked power demand story has you looking beyond a single utility, this could be a good moment to scan <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting list of grid focused names to research next.</p> <p>So with Portland General Electric raising about US$480 million, reporting US$306 million in net income, and leaning into AI related demand, is the current share price offering value or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.1% Overvalued</h2> <p>Portland General Electric’s most followed narrative puts fair value at about $52.32, slightly below the last close of $53.96, which frames the current AI and PacifiCorp excitement as already largely reflected in the price.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Robust and sustained demand growth from industrial and data center customers is accelerating system wide electricity usage, underpinned by Oregon's strong technology sector and regional electrification objectives; this is expected to solidly grow PGE's revenue base and support long term earnings expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing transition to clean energy including major renewable procurements (2023 and 2025 RFPs) and battery storage integration position PGE to capitalize on declining renewable costs and federal tax credits, which should drive rate base growth, lower operational costs, and support future margin improvement.</em></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/dlz3g6mc-analyst-commentary-highlights-raised-targets-and-battery-storage-gains-for-portland-general-electric\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how steady demand, cleaner generation, and a higher future earnings multiple all fit into one price tag?

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $2.78b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest free cash flow reaching around $3.70b by 2030, with a path that moves through projected figures such as $2.81b in 2026 and $3.46b in 2029, all in US dollars.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $462.30 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $307, this implies a 33.6% discount, which indicates that the shares screen as undervalued under this particular set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Public Storage is undervalued by 33.6%.

It captures both what the business is earning today and how the market is weighing its prospects and risks.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more cautious multiple. The question is not whether a P/E is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Public Storage currently trades on a P/E of 33.99x. That sits above the Specialized REITs industry average of 15.86x, and below the peer group average of 41.55x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Public Storage is 34.36x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given the company’s earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it tries to account for the specific mix of growth, risk and profitability that is unique to Public Storage.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 33.99x very close to the Fair Ratio of 34.36x, the shares screen as ABOUT RIGHT on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Public Storage into a clear story that links its business outlook to a financial forecast, then to a fair value, all inside Simply Wall St’s Community page where millions of investors share their assumptions. You can compare a more upbeat view that leans toward the higher US$350 price target with a more cautious view closer to US$287, see how each Narrative’s fair value stacks up against today’s share price, and watch those fair values update automatically as new earnings, guidance or news come through. This can give you a practical framework to decide whether the current price lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Public Storage? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/PSA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The 2025 10-K reinforces that story: management is leaning into a diversified deposit base, higher-yielding securities and a thicker capital cushion, with CET1 at 14.10% and shareholders’ equity up 14.4%. That is reassuring given recent volatility in bank funding costs, and it supports the near-term dividend story after the latest increase to US$0.24 per share. At the same time, the filing also puts a spotlight on the weak revenue growth, a 3.1% net interest margin and a greater tilt toward variable-rate loans, which keeps interest rate risk, funding competition and the stock’s above-peer valuation firmly on the list of near-term swing factors.</p> However, investors should not ignore how interest rate sensitivity could pressure margins if conditions shift.\n\nDespite retreating, First Bancorp's shares might still be trading 41% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/18aaef02-f6ad-4640-bf94-5195b7c7866f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$54 to almost US$97 per share, underlining how far apart individual views can be.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today’s terms.</p> <p>For USA Rare Earth, the latest twelve month free cash flow (FCF) is a loss of $39.02 million. Analyst and model projections see FCF running through a mix of negative and positive years, with a projected $735.00 million in FCF for 2030. Beyond the explicit analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends the cash flow path using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.</p> <p>Combining all of those discounted cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $203.77 per share. When this is compared with the recent share price of $18.90, the model suggests the stock trades at a 90.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates substantial potential upside based solely on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests USA Rare Earth is undervalued by 90.7%.

It is especially common in capital intensive sectors where tangible assets matter.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/B, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower multiple. That is why it helps to look at a company’s P/B next to its sector and peers, rather than in isolation.</p> <p>USA Rare Earth currently trades on a P/B ratio of 68.02x. This sits well above the Metals and Mining industry average P/B of 2.66x and above the peer group average of 8.63x. Simply Wall St also uses a “Fair Ratio”, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/B should be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s risks, its industry and its market cap. This Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored anchor than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for those company specific features.</p> <p>On this framework, USA Rare Earth’s current P/B of 68.02x is higher than the Fair Ratio assessment would typically support.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins and fair value.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit in the Community page and let you connect USA Rare Earth’s business story to a clear financial forecast, then to a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to help you decide whether it feels more like a buy, a hold or a sell for you.</p> <p>Because Narratives on the platform are updated as new information comes in, such as news or earnings, they stay aligned with the latest data without you needing to rebuild your thinking from scratch every time something changes.</p> <p>For example, one Narrative on USA Rare Earth might see a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future cash flows and margins. Another Narrative might point to a much lower fair value because its author expects more modest revenue and profitability.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for USA Rare Earth? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/USAR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
