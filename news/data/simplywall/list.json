However, the official stance is that no production decision has been made yet until milestones are completed. Practical interpretation: until Silverco releases a restart study, financing, and a detailed schedule, any exact “full production” date would be guesswork.</em></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/0ox1qy9t-update-for-silverco-mining\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how a zero revenue explorer gets to that CA$199 figure?

At the same time, broader market discussions around materials and construction stocks have given context to Vulcan's share price moves, as investors compare it to peers and sector trends.</li> <li>Despite that backdrop, Vulcan Materials currently has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>.

Analysts provide explicit projections through 2028, with free cash flow for that year modeled at $1.60b. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates out to 2035, generating a full 10 year cash flow path in dollar terms.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF output points to an estimated intrinsic value of about $269.82 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$310.00, this output indicates that Vulcan Materials is around 14.9% overvalued on this model.</p> <p>On this DCF view, the current market price is above the modelled cash flow value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Vulcan Materials may be overvalued by 14.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"VMC Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b5c73fc4-1c78-42f4-b741-436f7057bd54/chart/dcf?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>VMC Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Vulcan Materials.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Vulcan Materials Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Vulcan Materials, the P/E ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of earnings. In general, higher expected earnings growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk tends to align with a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Vulcan Materials is trading on a P/E of 37.44x. That compares with an average P/E of 15.56x for the wider Basic Materials industry and a peer group average of 27.79x, so the stock is priced above both of those reference points. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for Vulcan Materials of 24.44x. This is the P/E it might trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market capitalization and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific drivers rather than assuming one size fits all. Lining up the current P/E of 37.44x against the Fair Ratio of 24.44x suggests Vulcan Materials is trading at a richer multiple than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VMC P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b5c73fc4-1c78-42f4-b741-436f7057bd54/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VMC P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You can plug in the assumptions you believe in, see the Fair Value that falls out of those numbers, and quickly judge whether that is above or below Vulcan Materials' current share price.</p> <p>Because Narratives update as new information comes in, such as earnings, guidance or news about highway spending and buybacks, your story and its Fair Value do not stay frozen. They move with the data so you can keep checking whether the gap between price and value still supports holding, trimming or adding.</p> <p>For Vulcan Materials, one investor might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to US$340 per share that leans on stronger infrastructure demand and margin expansion. Another might prefer a more cautious Narrative nearer US$190 to US$239.78 per share that leans on sustainability pressures, regulation and slower construction. Both can see in one place how their different stories link to different Fair Values and decisions.</p> <p>For Vulcan Materials, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Vulcan Materials Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/0leo7c01-highway-project-spending-and-pricing-trends-will-sustain-balanced-opportunity-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Vulcan Materials Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish Narrative: US$327.57 per share</p> <p>Gap to that fair value at the recent US$310.00 price: about 5.4% below the Narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 5.34% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp expect infrastructure spending, Sunbelt demand and disciplined pricing to support revenue and earnings over several years.</li> <li>They factor in higher profit margins over time, supported by cost control, automation, acquisitions and a steady project pipeline.</li> <li>Their numbers line up with an analyst consensus price target around US$304.05 and a fair value estimate near US$327.57, with the view that the current price is broadly in line with those assumptions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/materials/nyse-vmc/vulcan-materials/3wytubgl-shifting-urbanization-and-sustainability-will-erode-traditional-aggregates?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Vulcan Materials Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish Narrative: US$264.31 per share</p> <p>Gap to that fair value at the recent US$310.00 price: about 14.8% above the Narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used: 8.75% a year</p> <ul> <li>This group flags long term headwinds from sustainability trends, regulation, reserve quality and alternative building methods that could pressure traditional aggregate demand.</li> <li>They still model revenue and earnings growth, but think the P/E multiple implied by the current price asks too much of future execution and market conditions.</li> <li>Their updated fair value of about US$264.31 reflects those concerns, with the view that recent gains leave less room for error.</li> </ul> <p>Taken together, these Narratives frame a clear range for Vulcan Materials, from a more optimistic fair value near US$327.57 to a more cautious one around US$264.31. Your own view on volumes, margins and the P/E you are comfortable with will decide which story feels closer to reality.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The latest update sharpens that tradeoff. On one hand, the 2025 net loss widening to US$766.63 million reinforces that this is a pure clinical-stage story with no revenue and rising operating costs. On the other, raising about US$408.10 million via an at-the-market equity program, layering on new shelf capacity tied to employee stock plans, reporting unprecedented VAX-31 Phase 2 data, moving quickly into several Phase 3 trials and finishing a large-scale manufacturing facility all feed directly into the near-term catalysts: clinical readouts, regulatory milestones and potential partnering discussions. The key risk profile also shifts slightly, with financing risk reduced for now but dilution, trial execution and commercial build-out risks front and center. Overall, the February 2026 news is material because it both extends the funding runway and accelerates the company toward its most binary events.</p> However, investors should not overlook how rising losses and ongoing dilution could affect future outcomes.\n\nVaxcyte's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 33%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-pcvx/vaxcyte/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-pcvx/vaxcyte\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PCVX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a5c22673-aeb2-4b4c-9e84-eb62a6baad5a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PCVX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Three Simply Wall St Community fair values, from US$10.90 to US$109.00, show just how far apart expectations sit.

The Michael Campbell hire directly targets the key short term catalyst, a potential DURAVYU launch, but it does not change the fact that any delay or disappointment in the pivotal trials remains the central risk for a company with minimal current revenue.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the Phase 3 DURAVYU update following the second DSMC review in November 2025 is most relevant here, because it kept the pivotal program on track toward potential commercialization. Campbell’s arrival now sits on top of that clinical backdrop, linking trial progress with an increasingly built out launch and manufacturing footprint, which together frame both the upside catalyst of a successful entry into wet AMD and DME and the execution risk if uptake proves slower than expected.</p> <p>Yet against that excitement, investors should be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint/nwrya9z6-phase-iii-trials-in-wet-amd-will-expand-market-reach-ncqs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on EyePoint (it's free!)</a></p><p>EyePoint's narrative projects $146.7 million revenue and $34.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint/nwrya9z6-phase-iii-trials-in-wet-amd-will-expand-market-reach-ncqs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how EyePoint's forecasts yield a $36.08 fair value</a>, a 105% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"EYPT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3922204e-9934-411a-90c5-e170feacb161/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>EYPT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest estimate analysts were assuming only about 7.9% annual revenue growth and ongoing losses, so compared with those views, you should see Campbell’s appointment and the Phase III dependence as parts of a much more cautious story that might look different once updated forecasts reflect this new hire.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on EyePoint</a> - why the stock might be worth just $36.08!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

At the same time, longer term total shareholder returns of 61.69% over one year and 168.29% over five years point to gains that investors will compare with current expectations.</p> <p>If this leadership news has you thinking more broadly about where growth could come from in mobility and manufacturing, it might be worth scanning <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_robotics\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473746/robotics-andamp-automation-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 robotics and automation stocks</a> as a fresh set of ideas to review next.</p> <p>With Aisin trading at ¥2,779.5 and sitting at an estimated 45% discount to one intrinsic value measure and around 9% below the average analyst price target, is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Preferred P/E of 12.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Aisin's current P/E of 12.2x sits at an interesting crossroads, with the shares at ¥2,779.5 and various signals pointing in different directions compared with both peers and an internally estimated fair ratio.</p> <p>The P/E multiple compares the company’s share price with its earnings per share, so it essentially reflects what investors are currently willing to pay for each unit of profit. For an auto components group like Aisin, this is a common yardstick because earnings are a direct link to its large base of recurring supply contracts and exposure to vehicle production volumes.</p> <p>Here, the picture is mixed. On one hand, Aisin is described as expensive versus the broader JP Auto Components industry average P/E of 11.4x, which suggests the market is paying a premium relative to many sector peers. On the other hand, the same 12.2x P/E is assessed as good value compared with an estimated fair P/E of 15.5x, as well as against a peer average of 19.3x in a separate comparison. Those reference points imply that if valuations shifted closer to the higher peer averages or the fair ratio, the multiple could move up from current levels rather than down.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7259/aisin-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Aisin</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-earnings of 12.2x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, investors still need to watch for any slowdown in annual revenue and net income growth and for how the leadership shift affects execution on Aisin's broad product portfolio.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7259/aisin-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Aisin narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on Aisin's value using our DCF model</h2> <p>The P/E story suggests some room for upside, but our DCF model presents a stronger valuation case. On this measure, Aisin at ¥2,779.5 is trading at a 45.4% discount to an estimated future cash flow value of ¥5,091.84. This indicates a wider potential value gap.</p> <p>Such a gap can reflect genuine mispricing, or it can suggest that the market is more cautious about long term cash flows than the model assumes.

Right now, the main near term catalyst is whether underwriting profitability can stay resilient as commercial property conditions soften, while the biggest risk remains higher catastrophe losses and volatility in property results. The AM Best upgrade and new bond issue support financial flexibility, but do not fundamentally change that risk profile in the short term.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the AM Best upgrade to A++ stands out as most relevant. A higher financial strength rating can support RLI’s ability to write specialty business and access reinsurance on better terms, which matters if catastrophe claims stay elevated.

This points to a discount at the current ¥1,570.5 share price.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so it effectively tells you how much investors are paying for each unit of earnings. For a real estate group that is already profitable and generating net income of ¥92,302 million, P/E is a straightforward way to gauge how the market is pricing those earnings today.</p> <p>Here, the company screens as good value against several yardsticks. The current 12.1x P/E is below the estimated fair P/E of 16.2x. It also sits below the peer average of 14.3x, the Japan real estate industry average of 12.8x, and the broader Japan market at 15.6x.

The latest result, with a reduced A$4.78 million net loss and a smaller A$0.02 loss per share, reinforces the core short term catalyst: further operating leverage as revenue scales. It also slightly softens one of the key risks highlighted earlier, that ongoing cash burn could require fresh capital if progress stalled. That said, the sharp share price pullback over the past quarter suggests the market remains cautious about execution, competitive pressures and the timing of any move into profitability. In that context, this half-year update helps, but does not remove, the central risk that profitability could take longer or prove harder than expected.</p> However, one risk around future funding needs is something investors should pay close attention to.\n\nDespite retreating, SiteMinder's shares might still be trading 38% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b2979078-1620-4ca0-a9bd-9c9d16b95979/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Ten fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span A$4.40 to A$10.75, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

For a utility like Hokkaido Electric it reflects what investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings given its regulated returns, capital intensity and cash flow profile.</p> <p>Here, the stock is described as expensive versus its immediate peer average P/E of 4.2x. It is also framed as good value against the Asian Electric Utilities average of 17.6x and a fair P/E estimate of 9.5x, suggesting the market is pricing its earnings materially lower than the level that model implies it could move towards.</p> <p>Relative to the broader JP market P/E of 15.6x, the 4.4x P/E is also much lower, which again underlines how compressed the multiple looks compared with both domestic equities and the sector wide context.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Hokkaido Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 4.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh regulatory changes or project delays at Ishikariwan Shinko that could affect earnings, cash flows, and how reliable that P/E looks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Hokkaido Electric Power Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points the other way</h2> <p>While the 4.4x P/E suggests room to move closer to the 9.5x fair ratio, our DCF model is more conservative.
