The recent quarterly update showed resilient revenue growth and management’s push for a US$60 billion infrastructure plan while near-term earnings fell slightly short due to higher expenses and wildfire-related settlement charges, yet there appears to be no material shift to short-term catalysts or core risks at this stage.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, Xcel Energy’s reaffirmed earnings guidance for 2025 and the new 2026 outlook stand out. These updates provide investors a sense of predictability and back the narrative that regulated utility investments, if executed well, can translate into steady cash flows despite near-term uncertainties in earnings delivery or legal liabilities.\n</p> <p> By contrast, there is still a real risk to watch: persistent wildfire litigation and costly settlements could impact Xcel’s financial flexibility if...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nasdaq-xel/xcel-energy/3xoflwmg-analysts-lift-xcel-energy-price-targets-as-litigation-clears-and-growth-prospects-improve\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Xcel Energy (it's free!)</a></p><p>Xcel Energy's outlook anticipates $17.4 billion in revenue and $2.9 billion in earnings by 2028.

This positions BLX to grow fee-based revenues over the coming 18 months.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, these moves should help expand operational efficiency and improve asset mix quality. Critics note, however, that growth in fee revenues may slow if the extraordinary $ millions generated by one-off syndication deals, such as the Staatsolie transaction, are not repeated in future quarters.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that ongoing expansion in structured, higher-margin activities is set to raise the baseline for earnings and lower cyclicality over time.</li> <li>Reliance on large, infrequent transactions is also flagged as a risk for sustaining income at currently elevated margins.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative notes that these earnings catalysts present a balanced opportunity, inviting investors to judge if the upcoming fee and margin shifts really support the current market optimism.\n    <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/c4ac87fr-digital-trade-finance-platform-will-unlock-latin-american-opportunities-dnkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior S. A Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Deposit Funding Now Covers 62% of Needs</h2> <ul> <li>Deposit-based funding now represents 62% of BLX’s total, helping reduce the cost of funds and improve resilience in net interest margins compared to competitors that remain reliant on more volatile wholesale sources.</li> <li>Consensus narrative underscores that this prudent shift supports stronger asset quality and earnings stability. However, it warns that high regional sovereign and quasi-sovereign exposures still introduce risks if Latin American credit shocks or cyclical downturns materialize.\n    <ul> <li>Strong asset quality, with near-zero non-performing loans and high reserve coverage, reinforces the bank’s position to capture growth opportunities while limiting margin downside.</li> <li>Ongoing exposure to state-linked entities and regional macro volatility remains a material factor for future profitability swings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Discounted Valuation Even With Slowing Growth</h2> <ul> <li>BLX’s P/E ratio of 7.1x remains well below both the US diversified financial industry (14.8x) and peer average (50x). The current share price of $43.01 also continues to trade beneath both the analyst price target ($55.50) and DCF fair value ($66.69).</li> <li>Per the consensus narrative, this deep discount reflects solid value and high-quality earnings. However, since forward revenue and earnings growth are both forecast to decelerate below US market averages (7.5% and 9.3% per year, respectively), the market is signaling some caution about longer-term business momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that analysts see only 1.6% upside from the current share price to their price target, reinforcing the idea that BLX is already fairly priced in the short term.</li> <li>Bears argue that the upside may remain limited unless future profit growth or the bank’s fee platform meaningfully exceeds these forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/c4ac87fr-digital-trade-finance-platform-will-unlock-latin-american-opportunities-dnkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior S.

The appointment of Karthik Suri as Chief Product and Corporate Strategy Officer is a meaningful move, but any impact on short-term catalysts, particularly stabilizing customer retention among top accounts, may not be immediately visible. The largest risk remains the potential for customer churn among key enterprise clients, which could overshadow gains from leadership changes if not addressed effectively.</p> <p>One recent announcement that connects directly to this theme is the September launch of next-generation AI solutions, including Sprinklr Copilot and AI Agents. These products are designed to boost operational efficiency and customer engagement, tying back to Sprinklr’s main growth drivers and offering a pathway to strengthen customer relationships. Yet, compared with the challenge of retaining and expanding enterprise clients, product launches alone may not offset risks if client satisfaction issues persist.</p> <p>However, investors should be aware that even with new executive leadership, challenges tied to concentrated enterprise customer dependence can...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nyse-cxm/sprinklr/dzuuz0ik-analyst-commentary-highlights-mixed-outlook-for-sprinklr-amid-modest-valuation-increase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sprinklr (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sprinklr's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $36.8 million earnings by 2028.

That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 8.1% in total.  So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.   </p> <p> Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 11%  each year as estimated by the two analysts watching the company.  With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth  per year, that's a disappointing outcome. </p><p> With this information, we are not surprised that Otter Tail is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. </p><p> We've established that Otter Tail maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Plus, you should also learn about these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-ottr/otter-tail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs we've spotted with Otter Tail</strong></a> (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant).  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a low P/E. </a> </p></div>",

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.52 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.24.      This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.1% a year over that time.     Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.    </p> <h2>First Community Bankshares Could Grow Its Dividend</h2> <p> The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time.     We are encouraged to see that First Community Bankshares has grown earnings per share at 6.5% per year over the past five years.       Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.    </p> <h2>In Summary</h2> <p> Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.       While First Community Bankshares is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.  Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Perhaps the market is expecting the current trend of poor revenue growth to continue, which has kept the P/S suppressed.  If you still like the company, you'd be hoping revenue doesn't get any worse and that you could pick up some stock while it's out of favour.     </p> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-aosl/alpha-and-omega-semiconductor/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Alpha and Omega Semiconductor </a>will help you uncover what's on the horizon.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/S?  </h2><p> In order to justify its P/S ratio, Alpha and Omega Semiconductor would need to produce anemic growth that's substantially trailing the industry.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 5.9%.   Still, lamentably revenue has fallen 10% in aggregate from three years ago, which is disappointing.  So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 2.5% over the next year.  Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 37%, which is noticeably more attractive. </p><p> With this in consideration, its clear as to why Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S is falling short industry peers.  Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S? </h2><p> While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> As expected, our analysis of Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-aosl/alpha-and-omega-semiconductor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Alpha and Omega Semiconductor</strong></a> that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> If these <strong>risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Alpha and Omega Semiconductor</strong>, explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/206/big-green-snowflakes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of high quality stocks</a> to get an idea of what else is out there. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Oshkosh Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:OSK</a>) shares in the week since its quarterly report, with the stock down 12% to US$123.       Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$2.7b, statutory earnings were in line with expectations, at US$3.04 per share.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/294167-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1762001295097\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:OSK Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Oshkosh's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$11.0b in 2026. This reflects an okay 6.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 18% to US$12.38.        Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$11.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.50 in 2026.        The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Oshkosh </a></span></p> <p> The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$150, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations.        That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets.  There are some variant perceptions on Oshkosh, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$185 and the most bearish at US$119 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Oshkosh shareholders.    </p> <p> Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/industrials/machinery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates.     We would highlight that Oshkosh's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 9.8% p.a. growth over the last five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.4% annually.  Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Oshkosh is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates.        Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Oshkosh. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple Oshkosh analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Oshkosh </a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p></div>",

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 31% in total over the last three years.  Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 15% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> With this information, we can see why Neo-Concept International Group Holdings is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Neo-Concept International Group Holdings' P/E? </h2><p> Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Neo-Concept International Group Holdings maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.

Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.    </p> <h2>Dividend Growth Potential Is Shaky</h2> <p> With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future.      MGP Ingredients' EPS has fallen by approximately 12% per year during the past five years.  This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future.   On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.    </p> <h2>MGP Ingredients' Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable</h2> <p> Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year.       The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics.  Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>Limbach Holdings</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:LMB</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.  To calculate this metric for Limbach Holdings, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.21 = US$46m ÷ (US$343m - US$123m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>Limbach Holdings has an ROCE of 21%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Limbach Holdings </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/263324968-roce-1-dark-2/1762001534848\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:LMB Return on Capital Employed November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Limbach Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.  If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free analyst report for Limbach Holdings </a>. </p><h2> What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us </h2><p> We like the trends that we're seeing from Limbach Holdings.    The numbers show that in the last  five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 21%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 109%.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p> <p> One more thing to note, Limbach Holdings has decreased current liabilities to 36% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors.  This tells us that Limbach Holdings has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.   </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> To sum it up, Limbach Holdings has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last  five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Limbach Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Results overall were solid, with revenues arriving 2.3% better than analyst forecasts at US$134m. Higher revenues also resulted in substantially lower statutory losses which, at US$0.01 per share, were 2.3% smaller than the analysts expected.     Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.  So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This would reflect a decent 16% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 70% to US$0.18.       Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$596.3m and US$0.22 per share in losses.         While the revenue estimates were largely unchanged, sentiment seems to have improved, with the analysts upgrading their numbers and making a favorable reduction in losses per share in particular.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for AtriCure </a></span></p> <p> There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$51.44, suggesting that reduced loss estimates are not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation.        It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean.  There are some variant perceptions on AtriCure, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$64.00 and the most bearish at US$40.00 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await AtriCure shareholders.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the AtriCure's past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/healthcare/medical-equipment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that AtriCure's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 18% over the past five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 8.4% per year.  So it's pretty clear that, while AtriCure's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on AtriCure. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple AtriCure analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> Even so, be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> AtriCure is showing <strong> 1 warning sign in our investment analysis</strong> </a>, you should know about...   </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>Astrana Health, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ASTH</a>) does carry debt.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Astrana Health's Net Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, Astrana Health had US$413.6m of debt at June 2025, down from US$442.0m a year prior.    On the flip side, it has US$342.1m in cash leading to net debt of about US$71.4m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/4634897-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762001677961\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:ASTH Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Astrana Health's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, Astrana Health had liabilities of US$459.7m due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$444.7m due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of US$342.1m and US$369.4m worth of receivables due within a year.   So its liabilities total US$192.9m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  </p><p> Since publicly traded Astrana Health shares are worth a total of US$1.59b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Astrana Health </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While Astrana Health's low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.72 suggests only modest use of debt, the fact that EBIT only covered the interest expense by 3.5 times last year does give us pause.  But the interest payments are certainly sufficient to have us thinking about how affordable its debt is.        Shareholders should be aware that Astrana Health's EBIT was down 27% last year.   If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Astrana Health can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, Astrana Health generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 84% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect.  That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Astrana Health's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better.   In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow.        We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like Astrana Health commonly do use debt without problems.     Considering this range of data points, we think Astrana Health is in a good position to manage its debt levels.  Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it.     There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Astrana Health</strong> </a> you should be aware of.    </p> <p> At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> A week ago, <strong>NETGEAR, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:NTGR</a>) came out with a strong set of third-quarter numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock.      Revenues and losses per share were both better than expected, with revenues of US$185m leading estimates by 6.9%. Statutory losses were smaller than the analystsexpected, coming in at US$0.17 per share.      This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This would be a satisfactory 2.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.      Losses are expected to hold steady at around US$0.90.       Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$716.4m and US$1.28 per share in losses.         While the revenue estimates were largely unchanged, sentiment seems to have improved, with the analysts upgrading their numbers and making a very promising decrease in losses per share in particular.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for NETGEAR </a></span></p> <p> There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$36.33, suggesting that reduced loss estimates are not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation.        There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business.  Currently, the most bullish analyst values NETGEAR at US$40.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$29.00.   As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/tech/communications\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's also worth noting that the years of declining revenue look to have come to an end, with the forecast stauing flat to the end of 2026. Historically, NETGEAR's top line has shrunk approximately 16% annually over the past five years.    Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 9.9% annually.  Although NETGEAR's revenues are expected to improve, it seems that it is still expected to grow slower than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year.        On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for NETGEAR going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> You can also see our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> analysis of NETGEAR's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered whether Broadcom’s soaring share price is still backed by solid value, or if it is starting to outpace its fundamentals? You are not alone, and today we are putting its valuation under the microscope.</li> <li>Broadcom’s stock has delivered eye-catching returns, climbing 4.4% in the last week, 10.9% in the past month, and an impressive 59.3% year-to-date, with a staggering 121% gain over the past year.</li> <li>Recent headlines have been all about Broadcom’s growing presence in the AI semiconductor space and its high-profile acquisitions.

This approach aims to capture what Broadcom is truly worth based on its ability to generate cash over time.</p> <p>For Broadcom, current free cash flow stands at $24.8 Billion. Analysts estimate the company’s free cash flow will grow substantially, reaching about $94.1 Billion by 2029. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates even further, projecting free cash flows to continue increasing over the next decade. While analyst coverage is strong over the next 5 years, estimates past that period are based on broader growth assumptions.</p> <p>Using this method, Broadcom’s intrinsic value per share is estimated at $313.06. Compared to the current share price, this implies the stock is trading at an 18.1% premium, meaning it is overvalued according to the DCF model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Broadcom may be overvalued by 18.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 832 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AVGO Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>AVGO Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Broadcom.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Broadcom Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often considered the gold standard for valuing profitable companies like Broadcom. It links a company’s share price to its earnings per share, offering investors an instant view of how much they are paying for a dollar of Broadcom’s current profits.</p> <p>What counts as a \"fair\" PE ratio depends largely on expectations. If a company is growing quickly or is viewed as lower risk, investors are generally willing to pay a higher PE. In contrast, lower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower PE.</p> <p>Broadcom’s current PE ratio is 92.8x, which is substantially higher than both the semiconductor industry average of 37.6x and the average of its direct peers at 63.8x. While this suggests a premium, Simply Wall St’s proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" model estimates a fair PE for Broadcom would be 63.3x. This Fair Ratio goes beyond basic comparisons by considering Broadcom’s unique growth outlook, profit margins, market capitalization, industry dynamics, and potential risks. It provides a more nuanced benchmark than simply looking at peers or industry averages.</p> <p>Comparing Broadcom’s current PE of 92.8x to its Fair Ratio of 63.3x, the stock appears significantly overvalued by this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:AVGO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:AVGO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Broadcom Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. In simple terms, a Narrative is your personalized story about a company. It is how you connect what you believe about Broadcom’s future with a financial forecast and a fair value estimate.</p> <p>Rather than relying solely on stock charts or standard ratios, a Narrative helps you clearly lay out your assumptions for things like future revenue, profit margins, and risks, then links those beliefs directly to an estimated fair value. This turns abstract numbers into an actionable story, making valuation much more approachable and intuitive.</p> <p>Millions of investors already use Narratives on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where you can set your own fair value and see how it stacks up against the current price and others’ views. Narratives update automatically as new information, such as earnings or breaking news, comes in. This helps you stay aligned with the latest outlook and make buy or sell decisions confidently.</p> <p>For Broadcom, one investor’s Narrative might forecast robust AI chip demand and successful VMware integration, supporting a fair value above $460 per share. Another investor might see tough competition and execution risks, believing the shares are only worth $218. This highlights the importance of your own research and perspective.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Broadcom? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:AVGO Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:AVGO Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This method seeks to answer what Anheuser-Busch InBev is truly worth based on the cash it is expected to generate.</p> <p>For Anheuser-Busch InBev, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) stands at $10.9 billion.

A PE ratio effectively shows how much investors are willing to pay for each euro of earnings. This can be a useful lens for evaluating established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>Interpreting whether a PE ratio is high or low depends on growth expectations and perceived risks. Companies with strong expected growth or low risk typically trade at higher PE ratios, while mature or riskier businesses see lower ratios. It's important to compare a company's PE not just to industry norms but also to consider company-specific dynamics.</p> <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev currently trades on a PE ratio of 19.5x. This is slightly above the broader Beverage industry average of 17.8x, but below its global peer average of 23.0x. To gain further insight, Simply Wall St's proprietary Fair Ratio incorporates factors like earnings growth outlook, size, margins, and risks to estimate what a justified PE for the company should be.</p> <p>According to this Fair Ratio, Anheuser-Busch InBev deserves a PE of 33.4x. Unlike basic comparisons with peers or the sector, this Fair Ratio approach tailors valuation for this specific company by considering not just industry trends but also unique qualities such as its forecasted earnings growth, business risks, profit margins, and market size.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 33.4x to the current multiple of 19.5x, it appears Anheuser-Busch InBev is trading well below its justified value using this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/be/food-beverage-tobacco/ebr-abi/anheuser-busch-inbev-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTBR:ABI PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e9264b30-f5ce-4005-a381-c6f3ee663e60/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTBR:ABI PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Anheuser-Busch InBev Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your investment story, where you combine your view on a company's future with your own assumptions for its revenue, earnings growth, profit margins and more, linking those expectations directly to a fair value estimate.</p> <p>Rather than just looking at a single valuation number, Narratives allow you to anchor your personal outlook—whether optimistic, cautious, or anywhere in between—to a dynamic forecast and see what that means for your buy or sell decisions. Narratives are easy to create and available on Simply Wall St's Community page, empowering millions of investors to shape and share their own projections.</p> <p>What's more, Narratives automatically update when new news or results arrive, so your fair value stays relevant and timely. For example, different investors might build Narratives for Anheuser-Busch InBev ranging from highly confident, expecting €78.81 per share if you forecast strong premiumization and margin expansion, to more cautious, with a €54.84 fair value if you foresee headwinds from consumer shifts or emerging market risks.</p> <p>By creating and tracking your own Narrative, you can instantly compare your Fair Value to today's price and make smarter, ever-adaptive investment decisions backed by your own reasoning.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Anheuser-Busch InBev? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/be/food-beverage-tobacco/ebr-abi/anheuser-busch-inbev-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTBR:ABI Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e9264b30-f5ce-4005-a381-c6f3ee663e60/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTBR:ABI Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Momentum has faded lately, but long-term holders have still enjoyed solid gains.</p> <p>If you’re curious about other opportunities beyond real estate, now is a perfect moment to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But after such swings, is Alexander's undervalued in the current market, or are investors simply right to question its future prospects?

With the last close at $220.93, this figure suggests that the market is pricing in a premium for the business relative to its peers.</p> <p>The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings and is a widely used yardstick for gauging whether a stock is cheap or expensive within its industry. For a real estate investment trust (REIT) like Alexander's, this metric is especially important as market participants often seek stable earnings or distributions.</p> <p>Currently, Alexander's P/E of 30.2x is significantly higher than both the US Retail REITs industry average of 26.1x and the peer group average of 18.4x. Compared to the estimated Fair P/E Ratio of 20.3x, the difference becomes even more apparent, suggesting that the current valuation could be stretched unless substantial growth materializes.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-alx/alexanders/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Alexander's</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 30.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, declining net income growth and a notable discount to the analyst price target could challenge the optimistic case for Alexander's in the coming periods.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-alx/alexanders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Alexander's narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Perspective</h2> <p>While the market’s P/E metric casts Alexander’s shares as expensive, another approach, the SWS DCF model, paints a starker picture.

After a year of improving profitability and strong revenue growth, the company’s headline third-quarter revenue surge and positive mazdutide Phase 3 data have injected real momentum into its short-term outlook. These confirm that Innovent’s expansion beyond oncology, especially in the high-growth metabolic disease segment, may now be a key catalyst, and the faster-than-market revenue growth forecast could become more credible. However, bigger rewards come with complex risks, for Innovent, the steep price-to-earnings ratio and relatively low return on equity stand out, as does the risk of execution as new therapies reach a commercial inflection.
