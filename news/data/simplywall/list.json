            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Investors may be wondering whether Globe Life's current share price lines up with its underlying value, or if the market is missing something important.</li> <li>Globe Life shares last closed at US$145.26, with returns of 0.6% over 7 days, 4.8% over 30 days, 4.9% year to date, 14.9% over 1 year, 23.6% over 3 years and 55.7% over 5 years, giving investors plenty of price history to weigh against fundamentals.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Globe Life has focused on how the stock is priced relative to its peers and what that might imply for long term holders.

Instead of focusing on cash flows, it compares what shareholders might reasonably require as a return with what the business is estimated to earn on its equity base.</p> <p>For Globe Life, book value is estimated at $75.54 per share, with a stable book value of $90.80 per share, based on future book value estimates from 5 analysts. Stable EPS is estimated at $16.06 per share, sourced from weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 4 analysts. The average Return on Equity is 17.69%, while the cost of equity is $6.34 per share, implying an excess return of $9.72 per share.</p> <p>When these excess returns are projected and capitalised, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $363.36 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $145.26, this framework indicates the stock is around 60.0% undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Globe Life is undervalued by 60.0%.

Investors tend to accept a higher or lower P/E depending on what they expect for future earnings growth and how risky they believe those earnings are.</p> <p>Globe Life currently trades on a P/E of 9.84x. That sits below the Insurance industry average P/E of 12.02x and below the peer average of 12.54x. On the surface, that suggests the market is pricing Globe Life at a discount to many insurers with similar business models.</p> <p>Simply Wall St also calculates a Fair Ratio for Globe Life of 12.69x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, its industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. Because it incorporates these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can give a more tailored anchor than a simple comparison to broad industry or peer averages, which may mix companies with very different risk and growth setups.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 12.69x with the current P/E of 9.84x suggests Globe Life trades below this reference point, indicating the shares may be undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/insurance/nyse-gl/globe-life/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:GL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a9e23ace-003b-4bc2-9b5f-b8a643b5c6f8/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:GL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

It is where you combine your assumptions about Globe Life’s future revenue, earnings and margins with your view of risk to arrive at a fair value, instead of only relying on standard ratios like P/E.</p> <p>Because Narratives sit on the same platform used by millions of investors, you can see how your view compares with others. For example, one investor might lean closer to the higher fair value estimate around US$199.00, while another might anchor on the more cautious view near US$145.00. Each Narrative spells out the assumptions required for those different outcomes in a way that is easy to review and update over time.</p> <p>For Globe Life, here are previews of two leading Globe Life Narratives to make comparison easier:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/insurance/nyse-gl/globe-life/6tr84h3x-share-repurchases-and-earnings-outlook-will-support-insurance-sector-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Globe Life Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this Narrative: US$171.40 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: around 15.3% undervalued versus the last close of US$145.26</p> <p>Revenue growth input: 6.31% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp see digital underwriting, Direct to Consumer improvements and agent headcount trends as supportive for policy sales and earnings over time.</li> <li>They incorporate revenue growth of 5.1% a year in earlier assumptions, slightly higher profit margins by 2028, and higher earnings per share supported by ongoing share repurchases.</li> <li>This view aligns with an updated consensus fair value of US$171.40, which reflects higher revenue growth assumptions, a modestly lower margin, and a slightly higher future P/E multiple.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/insurance/nyse-gl/globe-life/2mem5xdt-demographic-decline-and-digital-disruption-will-dampen-future-performance?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Globe Life Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this Narrative: US$145.00 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: around 0.2% overvalued versus the last close of US$145.26</p> <p>Revenue growth input: 5.86% a year</p> <ul> <li>The cautious Narrative focuses on slower long term policy growth as demographics shift, household budgets stay tight, and digital first insurers compete for Globe Life’s core customer base.</li> <li>It uses lower revenue growth, a future P/E of 9.40x and a higher discount rate than before, which together pull the valuation toward the lower end of analyst targets.</li> <li>Regulatory, litigation and reputation risks, along with dependence on a relatively narrow product set and traditional distribution, are central to this fair value of US$145.00 per share.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how these two stories compare side by side and where your own view fits in, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The new C$650 million senior notes broaden its funding options but do not obviously alter the near term balance between its key upside catalyst (capital deployment into attractive investments or buybacks) and its main risk around earnings sensitivity to interest rates and catastrophe losses; the impact looks incremental rather than transformational for now.</p> <p>In that context, Fairfax’s recent update that it repurchased 572,266 shares for about C$946.84 million under its latest buyback is particularly relevant. Together with the fresh long dated debt, this pairing of issuance and repurchases highlights how the company is actively managing its capital structure around the current catalysts and risk profile, even if the exact mix between debt reduction, new investments, and future buybacks is still to be determined.</p> <p>But investors should also be aware that if interest rates reverse, the same balance sheet that benefits Fairfax today could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares/bvw1rr5q-share-repurchases-and-preferred-redemptions-will-drive-outperformance-amid-currency-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Fairfax Financial Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>Fairfax Financial Holdings' narrative projects $41.8 billion revenue and $2.9 billion earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares/bvw1rr5q-share-repurchases-and-preferred-redemptions-will-drive-outperformance-amid-currency-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Fairfax Financial Holdings' forecasts yield a CA$2708 fair value</a>, a 15% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:FFH 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/edb5d400-0098-4b2e-af68-888f673ce731/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:FFH 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were already assuming about US$41.9 billion of revenue and US$3.8 billion of earnings by 2028, so this fresh C$650 million in long term funding could either reinforce that upbeat story or challenge it, depending on how you feel about interest rate risk and capital deployment.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Fairfax Financial Holdings</a> - why the stock might be worth over 2x more than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your Fairfax Financial Holdings research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free Fairfax Financial Holdings research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate Fairfax Financial Holdings' overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Seeking Other Investments?</h2><p>These stocks are moving-our analysis flagged them today.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>CubeSmart (CUBE) has just wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$282.7 million and basic EPS of US$0.34, while trailing twelve month revenue sits at US$1.1 billion and EPS at US$1.46, giving investors a clear read on the top and bottom line heading into the new year. Over recent periods, the company has seen revenue move from US$268.5 million and EPS of US$0.45 in Q4 2024 to US$282.7 million and EPS of US$0.34 in Q4 2025, alongside trailing twelve month EPS shifting from US$1.73 in Q4 2024 to US$1.46 in Q4 2025. With that mix of higher revenue, modest EPS growth over the longer run and margin compression, this result set puts the focus firmly on how durable CubeSmart’s earnings power really is.</p> <a

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Squeezed As Net Income Softens</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, net income moved from US$391.2 million at a 36.6% margin a year ago to US$333.8 million at a 29.7% margin, so more revenue is now translating into a smaller share of profit.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about stable occupancy and cost control supporting stronger earnings over time, yet\n    <ul> <li>the step down in net income from US$391.2 million to US$333.8 million sits alongside that 6.9 percentage point margin compression, which shows costs have taken a larger bite out of revenue over the last year,</li> <li>so anyone leaning on the bullish angle of gradually improving margins needs to square that with the recent data that points to pressure on profitability instead.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Up, EPS Growth Lagging Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month revenue is US$1.1b, growing 4.8% per year compared with the broader US market at 10.3% per year, while EPS growth is 0.8% per year, also well below the US market at 15.6% per year.</li> <li>Bulls highlight resilient demand in dense urban markets and a steady storage need across housing cycles, and that story lines up only partly with the numbers\n    <ul> <li>because the 4.8% revenue growth rate points to a business that is expanding, but not at the pace of the wider market at 10.3% per year,</li> <li>and EPS growth running at 0.8% per year, against 15.6% for the US market, suggests that even with occupancy support, earnings power has not kept up with broader equity benchmarks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On this set of figures, bulls argue CubeSmart’s slower growth still rests on sticky demand, but you can see how the recent margin squeeze complicates that story before you read the full case in <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 CubeSmart Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation, Yield And Balance Sheet Tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$41.14, CubeSmart is trading on a P/E of 28.1x, below a peer average of 37x and slightly below the industry at 29.7x, with a 5.15% dividend yield and a DCF fair value of about US$59.08 indicating a sizeable gap to that modelled value.</li> <li>Skeptics point to balance sheet strain and slower growth, and the data gives them some clear talking points\n    <ul> <li>since one of the key risks flagged is that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow over the last 12 months, which sits awkwardly beside a valuation case built on a DCF fair value of US$59.08 that is well above the current price,</li> <li>and when you pair modest revenue growth of 4.8% per year and 0.8% EPS growth with that 5.15% yield, it underlines that investors are being compensated with income while also taking on a balance sheet that is working harder to support the capital structure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears often focus on that debt coverage risk alongside slower growth, so if you want to see how far that concern goes, the full case is laid out in <a

The latest half-year result, with largely flat net income but record underlying earnings and an increased A$0.12 interim dividend, modestly supports this thesis, though it does little to change the near-term risk that shifting customer behaviour and digital competitors keep margins under pressure.</p> <p>The most relevant update here is Flight Centre’s report of record first-half earnings driven by a 7% lift in total transaction value and 9% growth in underlying EBITDA, helped by AI-enabled productivity gains. This ties directly to the key catalyst that digital investment and higher-margin corporate services could gradually improve the company’s earnings mix, even as the broader travel industry remains exposed to macro, geopolitical and channel-shift risks.</p> <p>Yet, against this backdrop of record first-half earnings, investors should still be aware of how rising direct online bookings could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/consumer-services/asx-flt/flight-centre-travel-group-shares/ukyn9536-digital-platforms-and-corporate-travel-expansion-will-shape-future-markets-ebyw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Flight Centre Travel Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>Flight Centre Travel Group's narrative projects A$3.2 billion revenue and A$296.4 million earnings by 2028.

The latest results and 2026 guidance clarify the near term: the key catalyst is how efficiently EMCOR executes this backlog at healthy margins, while the most immediate risk is any slowdown or margin pressure in large U.S. construction projects. The initial market pullback on guidance does not appear to alter that core debate in a material way.</p> <p>The 2026 outlook of US$17.75 billion to US$18.50 billion in revenue and diluted EPS of US$27.25 to US$29.25 is the announcement that matters most here, because it anchors expectations against those record 2025 numbers and a backlog that has just been refreshed higher. For investors watching the catalysts, this guidance sets a reference point for whether EMCOR’s acquisition pipeline, prefabrication investments, and exposure to data centers and healthcare projects can offset risks from labor costs, industrial cyclicality, and any cooling in high tech project awards.</p> <p>Yet for all the strength in the backlog, investors should also be aware of how quickly sentiment can change if large project volumes or margins start to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-eme/emcor-group/kb3gkklm-analyst-upgrades-highlight-emcor-groups-strong-outlook-and-improved-valuation-amid-reshoring-trends\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on EMCOR Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>EMCOR Group’s narrative projects $20.6 billion revenue and $1.4 billion earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-eme/emcor-group/kb3gkklm-analyst-upgrades-highlight-emcor-groups-strong-outlook-and-improved-valuation-amid-reshoring-trends\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how EMCOR Group's forecasts yield a $772.00 fair value</a>, a 7% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-eme/emcor-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"EME 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/989ffce2-fd32-4742-82b0-49bacf6d4d1c/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>EME 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this report, the most optimistic analysts were penciling in roughly US$21.2 billion of revenue and US$1.4 billion of earnings by 2028, which assumes EMCOR’s technology edge and energy retrofit exposure stay well ahead of peers.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether PUMA’s current share price reflects its true worth, you are not alone. Many investors are asking if the stock is pricing in too much pessimism or leaving room for a long term recovery story.</li> <li>PUMA last closed at €23.76, with returns of 2.2% over 7 days, 1.8% over 30 days and 6.1% year to date, set against a 1 year return of a 15.4% decline, a 55.5% decline over 3 years and a 69.4% decline over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage around PUMA has focused on how the brand is positioned within global sportswear and how it is competing on product, pricing and distribution against larger rivals.

It is a way of asking what you would pay now for the cash the business could generate in the future.</p> <p>For PUMA, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. On the latest figures, the company reported free cash flow of €13.39 million outflow, so the model relies heavily on future estimates. Analyst and extrapolated projections from Simply Wall St indicate annual free cash flow moving into positive territory and reaching €468.67 million in 2035, with interim years such as €117 million in 2026 and €246.67 million in 2030.</p> <p>When all these projected cash flows are discounted back using the DCF model, the estimated intrinsic value is about €30.06 per share. Compared with the recent share price of €23.76, this suggests the stock appears around 21.0% undervalued using this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PUMA is undervalued by 21.0%.

Investors tend to accept a higher or lower P/S depending on what they expect for future growth and how much risk they see in the business, so there is no single “right” number.</p> <p>PUMA currently trades on a P/S of 0.42x. This sits below both the Luxury industry average P/S of 0.83x and the peer average of 0.90x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for PUMA is 0.73x, which is the P/S level it estimates based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>The Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming all Luxury stocks deserve similar multiples. Setting the current P/S of 0.42x against the Fair Ratio of 0.73x suggests the market is pricing PUMA’s sales below what this framework indicates might be reasonable.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/consumer-durables/etr-pum/puma-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:PUM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4c6e37f2-6217-4b0b-a17a-358fc8caa192/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:PUM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simple stories you create about PUMA that link your view on its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value. This is all done within an easy tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that updates when new information like news or earnings arrives. It also lets you compare your Fair Value to the current price. For example, one investor might build a cautious PUMA Narrative closer to a €17.50 fair value, while another might lean toward a more optimistic view nearer €40.00. You can see exactly which assumptions lead to each outcome.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PUMA? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/PUM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/consumer-durables/etr-pum/puma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:PUM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4c6e37f2-6217-4b0b-a17a-358fc8caa192/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:PUM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company’s quarterly revenue has moved from ¥3.1b in Q2 2025 to ¥3.2b in Q4 2025 and then to ¥3.5b in Q3 2026. Over the same period, basic EPS has ranged from ¥17.10 to ¥29.25, giving investors a clearer view of how sales and per share profits are tracking into the current year. With trailing net profit margins slightly lower than a year ago and earnings quality still viewed positively in the data, this quarter’s focus is on how sustainable those margins appear.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-services/tse-3329/towa-food-service-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Towa Food Service.</a> <p>With the headline numbers disclosed, the next step is to examine how they align with the prevailing narratives around Towa Food Service and whether the latest margin and earnings trends support or challenge those views.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The single quarter of ¥27.50 in Q3 2026 therefore fits into a broader earnings band rather than standing alone.</li> <li>What stands out for the more bullish narrative is that trailing EPS of ¥90.82 comes alongside a five year earnings growth rate of 22.8% per year. Yet within this quarter to quarter range you still see softer prints like ¥15.61 in Q2 2026, which means\n    <ul> <li>Supporters pointing to the long run growth rate and current profitability can lean on the trailing net income of ¥733m, but they also have to accept that quarterly EPS can sit well below that trailing average in some periods.</li> <li>For a beginner investor, the tension is that the long run story looks strong in the data, while shorter term swings between ¥15.61 and ¥29.25 remind you that not every three month period will mirror that growth path.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When you see EPS jumping around this much, it helps to check how the longer term story lines up with those ups and downs and what other investors make of it in their own narratives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets? Explore Community Narratives</a></p> <h2>5.5% Margin Versus 23.5x P/E</h2> <ul> <li>The trailing net profit margin is 5.5%, slightly below last year’s 5.8%. The P/E ratio sits at 23.5x, modestly under the JP Hospitality average of 24.3x and the peer average of 24.1x, so profitability and pricing are both sitting close to industry levels.</li> <li>Critics who lean cautious can point out that a 5.5% margin pairs with a share price of ¥2,137 that is above a DCF fair value of about ¥1,653.21, which means\n    <ul> <li>The slight margin slip from 5.8% to 5.5% arrives at the same time the stock trades above that DCF figure, so anyone worried about paying up for earnings might see the combination as a reason to be careful.</li> <li>At the same time, the P/E at 23.5x is a touch lower than the 24.1x peer average, so the valuation is not stretched on every metric, which softens but does not cancel the more bearish valuation concern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Steady Around ¥13.2b TTM</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, revenue is ¥13.22b, with quarterly sales in the last six reported periods running between ¥3,132m and ¥3,464m. The latest Q3 2026 figure of ¥3,464m therefore sits at the upper end of that recent range while still feeding into a relatively tight revenue band.</li> <li>Supporters of the optimistic angle often highlight that this steady revenue base backs the idea of a stable everyday business, yet the trailing margin slip from 5.8% to 5.5% shows\n    <ul> <li>The top line of ¥13.22b over twelve months has not translated into expanding margins in the data provided, which keeps the focus on cost discipline rather than just sales volume.</li> <li>Because revenue has stayed in a fairly narrow range while net income over the trailing year is ¥733m, investors watching the optimistic story will likely pay close attention to how much of each additional yen of sales actually reaches profit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.</a></p> <p>Costco’s tariff refund lawsuits sit in the background of a business that already runs on tight product margins and relies heavily on membership fees for profit. If refunds are eventually paid, the main financial questions for you are how material the cash inflow is relative to Costco’s size and whether it is treated as a one off benefit or folded into ongoing operations. Management could use any recovered cash to support working capital, fund new warehouses, or consider a special dividend, but none of that is assured. On the flip side, emerging class actions argue that part of any refund should flow back to consumers, which could limit how much ultimately benefits shareholders and may introduce extra legal costs. For a retailer competing with Walmart, Target and Amazon, tariff outcomes also influence Costco’s ability to keep shelf prices low without squeezing margins further. Until courts resolve the cases, the tariffs story mainly adds another moving part to Costco’s cost structure and capital allocation choices rather than changing the core membership based model.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Tariff refunds, if received, could support Costco’s efforts to keep prices sharp and invest in warehouse expansion, which lines up with the narrative’s focus on membership driven scale and growth in new locations.</li> <li>Legal costs and uncertainty around who ultimately receives any refunds could work against the narrative’s assumption that Costco can offset cost pressures from tariffs and labor without much impact on margins.</li> <li>The narrative highlights tariff unpredictability as a risk, but it does not fully address the possibility of class actions seeking to share refunds with consumers, which may affect how much value Costco ultimately retains.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/7l6mtyiy-cost-market-share-gains-will-continue-driven-by-high-member-renewal-rates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Costco Wholesale</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Legal outcomes are uncertain, and class-action cases could reduce the portion of any tariff refunds that Costco is able to keep, or extend the timeline before any cash is received.</li> <li>⚠️ If courts or regulators push for broader consumer compensation, Costco may face additional administrative and reputational costs as it explains how it handled past tariffs and pricing.</li> <li>🎁 A successful refund outcome could add incremental cash that Costco can allocate across new warehouses, technology, or shareholder returns without relying on extra borrowing.</li> <li>🎁 The company’s willingness to contest tariffs signals active cost management, which can help support its value focused positioning against large peers such as Walmart and Amazon.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on updates from the U.S. Court of International Trade and any disclosures Costco provides in its quarterly or annual filings about the size of potential refunds and related contingencies. Watch for comments from management on how they would prioritize any tariff related cash between reinvestment, balance sheet strength, and possible one time shareholder distributions. It is also worth tracking whether consumer focused lawsuits expand beyond early cases against other companies, which could influence how investors think about future pass through of government imposed costs in retail.

This in turn is expected to enable margin expansion and improved profitability as AI and advanced packaging demand intensifies.

This helps frame how investors might think about the business backdrop to these returns. Commentary has also highlighted how investors are paying closer attention to companies exposed to connectivity and network infrastructure, which can influence how the market prices risk and potential.</li> <li>Despite these share price moves, Viavi Solutions holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>, so we will look at what different approaches like P/E, multiples and cash flow based estimates suggest about the current price.

The idea is to estimate what all those future cash flows are worth in today's dollars.</p> <p>For Viavi Solutions, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $74.64 million. Analyst and extrapolated projections, provided in the model, run out to 2035 and show free cash flow estimates reaching $536.31 million in that year, all expressed in US$ and then discounted back to the present.</p> <p>Pulling those discounted cash flows together, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$29.42 per share.

Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher P/S multiple. In contrast, slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull that “normal” range down.</p> <p>Viavi Solutions currently trades on a P/S of 5.53x. That sits above both the Communications industry average P/S of 1.92x and the peer average of 2.91x, so the market is attaching a richer sales multiple than these broad benchmarks.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Viavi Solutions is 6.07x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/S might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Because it looks at these company level characteristics rather than just simple peer or industry comparisons, it can give a more tailored sense of what “fair” could look like.</p> <p>Putting that beside the current 5.53x P/S, Viavi Solutions is priced below the 6.07x Fair Ratio on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St's Community page you can use Narratives to write the story behind your numbers for Viavi Solutions. You can link your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast and fair value, then compare that fair value with the current price to help decide when to buy or sell. The Narrative automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. Different investors can, for example, plug in a more optimistic view closer to the US$26.07 fair value with higher assumed growth and margins, or a more cautious view closer to US$12.00 with tighter assumptions and a lower P/E, even though both are using the same company and data.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Viavi Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/VIAV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

A guaranteed 1% cash back across more than 4,000 merchants, some funded directly by RetailMeNot, gives retailers a clearer, performance based offer and could help shift the business mix from pure traffic driven affiliate revenues toward more direct, relationship based marketing spend.

The company’s ongoing talks around AI content licensing with large platforms could influence both traffic and monetization, so any updates there will matter. It is also worth tracking whether management continues to exit or shrink lower return activities, similar to Games Publishing, and how that affects margins and earnings over the next few quarters. Finally, with share repurchases already reducing the share count by more than 10% in 2025, future capital allocation decisions, including any extension of the buyback program, will likely remain a key part of the story.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Ziff Davis, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ZD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Ziff Davis</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

An extended license would keep its fields in play for longer, and this is occurring at a time when European governments are focused on energy security and stable domestic supply. The news directly connects BlueNord's operational footprint with long dated policy support from Denmark.</p> <p>If the license extension proceeds, it could lengthen BlueNord's production horizon and support the long term planning of capital spending and field development. Investors will likely watch how the dialogue with the authorities progresses, the conditions attached to any agreement, and how BlueNord (OB:BNOR) frames this within its broader energy transition and portfolio plans.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/energy/ob-bnor/bluenord-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BlueNord</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

The company has just reported its highest quarterly production on record, outlined full year guidance around 25,000 barrels per day, and highlighted the Tyra hub’s maximum potential at about 30,000 barrels per day once stable operations are in place. At the same time, BlueNord has extended its US$1.4b reserve based lending facility to 2031 and added an Accordion option of up to US$400m. This gives the company additional financial flexibility for future commercial opportunities tied to these assets. For you, the key link is that a longer license life, more visible production from Tyra, and longer dated debt maturity all point to BlueNord framing the DUC as a core, cash generative hub that can support dividends, such as the proposed NOK 42.84 per share for Q4 2025, and ongoing investment. This is particularly relevant when you compare BlueNord with other North Sea focused players such as Aker BP, Harbour Energy or Var Energi, where field lives, license terms and financing arrangements also shape the long term profile.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The BlueNord Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The potential license extension supports the narrative’s focus on Tyra and the DUC as long term production anchors that can underpin revenue and support BlueNord’s aim of returning a high share of operating cash flow to shareholders.</li> <li>Analysts in the narrative highlight high debt and financial obligations as a constraint, and while the extended lending facility provides flexibility, a longer license life could encourage further investment that keeps leverage and interest costs in focus.</li> <li>The narrative puts most of the emphasis on Tyra’s redevelopment and gas price assumptions, whereas the invitation to extend the DUC license to 2050 introduces a regulatory and policy dimension that may not be fully captured in those earlier expectations.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f5b80muw-tyra-redevelopment-and-north-sea-gas-will-secure-long-term-stability-1v14\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for BlueNord</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that earnings are expected to decline by an average of 2.5% per year over the next 3 years, which could limit how much value BlueNord can extract from a longer DUC license period.</li> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are described as not well covered by earnings, so more capital spending on extended field life or new projects could stretch the balance sheet if cash flows do not track expectations.</li> <li>🎁 The company is assessed as trading at a very large discount to an estimate of its fair value, which means investors are currently paying a low price relative to that model if the long term DUC opportunity is realised.</li> <li>🎁 BlueNord has recently become profitable and is proposing a sizeable dividend for Q4 2025, so a longer production horizon from the DUC may support its stated intention to return a high share of operating cash flow to shareholders.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you will want to watch how negotiations with the Danish authorities progress, particularly any conditions around emissions, investment commitments or decommissioning that come with a license extension to 2050. Track whether Tyra can move from ramp up to stable production near the 30,000 barrels per day potential described by management, and how that compares to the 25,000 barrels per day guidance that already includes planned shutdowns. It is also worth monitoring how BlueNord uses its extended US$1.4b lending facility and US$400m Accordion option, and whether dividend plans such as the NOK 42.84 per share proposal remain aligned with production, cash flow and debt metrics. For context, comparing BlueNord’s capital returns, leverage and license life with peers like Aker BP, Harbour Energy and Var Energi can help you assess how differentiated this DUC opportunity really is.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for BlueNord, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/OB/BNOR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for BlueNord</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

It is a way of asking what you might reasonably pay now for those projected future dollars.</p> <p>For XPEL, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The company’s last twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $58.9 million. Analyst inputs and Simply Wall St extrapolations suggest Free Cash Flow of $57.9 million in 2026, rising in steps to a projected $242.4 million in 2035, all in $. These amounts are discounted back to today using a required return, which results in an estimated intrinsic value per share of about $126.69.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price around $42.62, the DCF output implies XPEL is trading at a 66.4% discount to this intrinsic value, which indicates a materially undervalued stock on this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests XPEL is undervalued by 66.4%.

A higher or lower P/E usually reflects what the market expects for future earnings growth and how much risk investors feel they are taking on.</p> <p>XPEL currently trades on a P/E of about 23x. That sits below the peer group average of roughly 24.9x and slightly above the Auto Components industry average of about 20.7x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a “Fair Ratio” of 20.6x for XPEL, which is the P/E level it might trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, size, industry and key risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio approach can be more informative than comparing only with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the specific characteristics of the company rather than assuming all businesses in the same group deserve the same multiple. With XPEL at 23x versus a Fair Ratio of 20.6x, the shares screen as somewhat expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-xpel/xpel/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:XPEL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/358cfe36-d2c1-426c-b8a4-35a170d548cd/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:XPEL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce Narratives, which are simple stories you create about XPEL that tie your view of its business, revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can compare that fair value to today’s price to help you decide whether you see the stock as attractive or not. You can then keep that view alive on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share Narratives that update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. In XPEL’s case you might, for example, align with a more optimistic community Narrative that sees fair value closer to US$55, or instead with a more cautious Narrative closer to US$38. By choosing which story feels more realistic to you, you turn scattered data into a clear, numbers backed view you can act on.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for XPEL? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/XPEL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-xpel/xpel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:XPEL 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/358cfe36-d2c1-426c-b8a4-35a170d548cd/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:XPEL 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
