The company is moving away from a heavy reliance on Amazon volumes and is putting more focus on higher margin categories like healthcare shipments and automated facilities. For investors, the changes highlight how management is rethinking where and how UPS earns its money.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the closures and driver buyout program could meaningfully alter UPS cost base and operational footprint by 2030. The key questions for shareholders will be how effectively UPS reallocates capacity to targeted growth areas and how the restructuring affects service quality, labor relations, and long term profitability.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-ups/united-parcel-service/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">United Parcel Service</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This works out to a 12.8% net margin compared with 18.4% the prior year.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view is that long term earnings resilience will come from regulated rate relief and capital investment, and the current 12.8% margin puts extra focus on whether future rate decisions and PFAS cost recovery are enough to support that thesis.\n    <ul> <li>The consensus narrative points to expanding infrastructure and reuse projects as supporting future earnings stability. The drop from 18.4% to 12.8% shows how higher compliance and treatment costs can tighten margins in the meantime.</li> <li>With trailing 12 month net income at US$128.2 million versus US$190.8 million a year earlier, the story now hinges on whether future rate cases and cost recoveries can line up more closely with this higher investment and operating spend.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue these margin pressures are temporary and tied to the timing of rate relief and PFAS recovery, not the earning power of the system over a full cycle. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 California Water Service Group Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E Sits Between Industry Benchmarks</h2> <ul> <li>CWT currently trades on a 20.7x P/E, above the Global Water Utilities average of 16.8x but below the closer Water Utilities peer average of 24.8x.</li> <li>Bears focus on this mid range P/E together with weaker coverage ratios, arguing that paying more than the global sector average looks demanding while interest and dividends are not well covered.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus data indicates that interest payments are not well covered by earnings and that the 3.01% dividend yield is not well covered by free cash flow, which makes a 20.7x multiple look less comfortable for cautious investors.</li> <li>At the same time, five year earnings growth of 9.1% per year and forecast growth of about 9.6% per year show why some investors still accept a P/E above the global average, even with these balance sheet pressures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics highlight that paying 20.7x earnings while interest and dividend coverage stay tight could leave less room for error if growth or regulation disappoint. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 California Water Service Group Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>DCF Fair Value Trails Share Price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of US$39.61 sits below the current share price of US$44.59, while the consensus analyst target of US$52.00 is above where the stock trades today.</li> <li>What stands out in the consensus narrative is the gap between these valuation markers and the operational backdrop, where forecast earnings growth of about 9.6% per year and revenue growth of roughly 5.3% per year are being weighed against regulatory and PFAS related cost risks.\n    <ul> <li>The analyst target of US$52.00 assumes earnings rising from about US$135.8 million today to US$187.9 million by around 2028, so any delay in rate cases or higher than expected PFAS capex would matter a lot for whether that path is achieved.</li> <li>At the same time, forecasts for revenue to reach around US$1.1b by 2028 from roughly US$1.0b on a trailing 12 month basis illustrate how much of the valuation debate comes down to modest top line growth supporting higher margins and returns over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/9t2mqp2i-capital-investment-in-water-infrastructure-will-expand-regulated-base-t1di\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for California Water Service Group on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Mixed signals so far, right?

For investors watching catalysts like U.S. growth and margin progression, this result anchors the narrative in actual performance rather than in the unused buyback programs, which so far sit more as optional tools than active drivers of shareholder returns.</p> <p>Yet behind the headline earnings progress, investors should be aware of the risk that scaling U.S. Surety and Specialty faster than risk controls can keep up...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-tsu/trisura-group-shares/gl6wdhyp-us-surety-and-specialty-expansion-will-open-new-opportunities-2wuy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Trisura Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>Trisura Group's narrative projects CA$4.0 billion revenue and CA$208.8 million earnings by 2028.

Together, these figures point to earnings that are more sensitive to costs and interest expense than the long term 6.5% annual earnings trend might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month net income of $22.4 million is well below the $42.2 million level reported a quarter earlier on a trailing basis, which lines up with the weaker margin picture.</li> <li>Bears highlighting interest coverage as a major risk get some support here because weaker cash generation makes it harder to comfortably meet those interest payments.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 📉 Skeptics who focus on that $27.2 million FFO loss may want the full cautionary case before deciding what comes next: <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 BTB Real Estate Investment Trust Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Margins fall from 29.8% to 17.2%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, BTB’s net profit margin sits at 17.2%, down from 29.8% the prior year, even though trailing revenue held around $130.1 million to $131.8 million.</li> <li>Supportive investors who take a more bullish angle might argue that the 6.5% per year earnings growth over five years shows the business has produced profits over time. However, the latest year of weaker margins and negative earnings relative to that trend pushes them to focus on whether this is a temporary squeeze or a more persistent shift.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 12 month net income of $22.4 million compares with $38.7 million a year earlier on a trailing basis, which is a clear step down even though revenue is broadly similar.</li> <li>With interest payments flagged as not well covered by earnings, the margin compression directly feeds into that risk, since there is less profit left after operating costs to service debt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 16.3x with a DCF fair value of $5.68</h2> <ul> <li>The units trade at a P/E of 16.3x versus a peer average of 11.4x and a Global REITs average of about 16x, while the DCF fair value used here is $5.68 per unit compared to a current price of $4.12. This implies roughly a 27.5% discount to that DCF fair value estimate.</li> <li>What is interesting for a valuation focused bullish angle is that, despite softer margins and weaker interest coverage, the P/E sits above peers yet the unit still screens at a discount to DCF fair value. This sets up a clear tension between earnings based multiples and cash flow based valuation.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 12 month revenue growth rate of 2.6% per year, below the 6.1% Canadian market benchmark, helps explain why some investors might hesitate to pay more even with that DCF gap.</li> <li>At the same time, a 17.2% net margin and positive trailing net income of $22.4 million give bulls some hard numbers to point to when they argue the current $4.12 price already reflects a good part of the recent pressure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how other investors are weighing that 27.5% DCF gap against the earnings pressure, it is worth checking what the community is debating around BTB right now: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/BTB.UN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about BTB Real Estate Investment Trust.</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Yet the current share price of US$204.33 still sits well below the cited DCF fair value of about US$588.00 and below the allowed analyst target of US$253.00, which means the bullish argument about underappreciated growth is being made against forecasts that show earnings and revenue growth of 3.1% and 4.2% per year respectively, both slower than the US market in the inputs.\n    <ul> <li>That tension between a low P/E and slower forecast growth is central to the bullish narrative that outpatient and behavioral expansion, plus technology efficiencies, could support higher margins than the consensus currently embeds.</li> <li>At the same time, the supplied data notes the stock trading materially below the DCF fair value and below US$253.00, which bullish investors treat as evidence that the market is not fully crediting the 30.4% trailing earnings growth and 8.6% margin achieved so far.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that the market is underestimating how sustained earnings growth and margin resilience could shift sentiment if current trends hold, especially with the stock on an 8.6x P/E and trading below both DCF fair value and the US$253.00 analyst target. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6pqkl3yw-new-outpatient-facilities-and-telehealth-will-unlock-secular-market-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Universal Health Services Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>High debt and policy risks against slower 3.1% EPS growth</h2> <ul> <li>The inputs highlight a high level of debt on the balance sheet alongside forecast earnings growth of about 3.1% per year and revenue growth of 4.2% per year, both cited as slower than the broader US market even though trailing net income over the last year is US$1.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on that leverage and on regulatory items such as expected US$360m to US$400m annual cuts to Medicaid supplemental payments by 2032, arguing that slower forecast growth plus higher interest and capital needs make it harder to sustain the 8.6% margin, even though recent results show improved profitability and 30.4% trailing earnings growth that so far have run ahead of those cautious assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>Critics highlight that if net benefit from Medicaid programs falls while revenue growth tracks closer to the 4.2% forecast, the combination of debt servicing and lower reimbursement could pressure earnings even if current EPS of US$23.42 on a trailing basis remains solid today.</li> <li>What challenges the bearish stance somewhat is that, despite these risks being flagged, analysts in the supplied data still reference earnings that have grown 7.3% per year over five years and a current margin above last year, which suggests the operational picture has been resilient so far even as future policy changes are being debated.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that high leverage and policy changes could matter more than recent EPS strength, especially if future growth sits near 3.1% while debt stays elevated. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Universal Health Services Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Universal Health Services on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the bullish and bearish angles laid out, how do they stack up for you right now, and what feels most important for your own portfolio decisions?

Together, these factors help explain why the share price has been so reactive, as investors reassess expectations and risk.</li> <li>Against that backdrop, Novo Nordisk currently scores 5 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown by our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/dk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/cph-novo-b/novo-nordisk-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation score</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is DKK 52,097.16m. Analyst and extrapolated projections suggest free cash flow reaching DKK 145,840.33m in 2030, with a path that includes DKK 41,926.80m in 2026 and DKK 207,436.58m in 2035. Simply Wall St uses analyst estimates where available, then extends them using its own growth assumptions for the later years.</p> <p>Discounting these projected cash flows back to today gives an estimated intrinsic value of DKK 1,072.30 per share. Compared with the recent share price of DKK 238.60, the DCF output suggests the market price is at a 77.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates that the stock appears materially undervalued on this model alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Novo Nordisk is undervalued by 77.7%.

It reflects what the market is willing to pay today for the company’s current profit stream.</p> <p>In simple terms, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative P/E. Novo Nordisk currently trades on a P/E of 10.35x, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 22.54x and a peer average of 26.08x. That raw comparison alone might suggest the stock is priced more cautiously than many of its peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Novo Nordisk is 25.04x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, profit margins, risk characteristics, industry, and market cap. Because it builds in these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison.

This article is designed to help you size up what you are really paying for.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$169.10, with returns of 1.8% over the past week, a 5.9% decline over the past month, a 4.1% decline year to date, a 0.5% gain over the past year, 86.6% over three years and 182.7% over five years, which may leave you questioning whether the recent path justifies today’s price tag.</li> <li>Recent company updates and sector news have kept Houlihan Lokey on investor watchlists, as corporate activity and advisory demand often steer sentiment around investment banks and financial advisors.

It starts from the equity on the balance sheet, then compares the company’s expected return on that equity to its estimated cost of equity.</p> <p>For Houlihan Lokey, the model uses a Book Value of US$32.92 per share and a Stable EPS of US$9.25 per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 4 analysts. The Average Return on Equity used is 25.05%, while the Cost of Equity is US$2.91 per share, implying an Excess Return of US$6.34 per share. The model also factors in a Stable Book Value of US$36.95 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$178.83 per share. Compared with the recent share price of about US$169.10, this suggests the stock is around 5.4% undervalued. This sits within a reasonable margin of error rather than providing a clear bargain signal.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Houlihan Lokey is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Excess Returns</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare what the market is currently willing to pay for the company’s earnings relative to other options.</p> <p>What counts as a reasonable P/E usually reflects two things: how quickly earnings are expected to grow, and how risky those earnings are perceived to be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk typically support a lower multiple.</p> <p>Houlihan Lokey currently trades on a P/E of 26.35x. That sits above both the Capital Markets industry average of 23.01x and the peer group average of 15.39x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Houlihan Lokey is 16.22x, which is its proprietary view of what a balanced P/E could look like after factoring in earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming one size fits all. With the current 26.35x P/E sitting above the 16.22x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St, within the Community page used by millions of investors, Narratives give you an easy way to set out that story in numbers, see how your view differs from others, and quickly spot when your Fair Value is above or below the current price. This can help you decide whether the stock fits your watchlist or portfolio. Narratives also refresh as new information such as news, earnings or updated analyst estimates are added, so your view does not stay frozen. For Houlihan Lokey, for example, one investor might align with the higher fair value view around US$242.55 per share while another might lean closer to the lower fair value of US$173 per share, and Narratives make those different perspectives clear and comparable in one place.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Houlihan Lokey? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HLI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>TTM profit of US$48.6 million supports 11.6% margin story</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last twelve months to Q4 2025, MiMedx generated about US$418.6 million of revenue and US$48.6 million of net income, which lines up with the 11.6% net margin mentioned earlier and shows profit has stayed in the low double digits.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view links this kind of profitability to long term earnings potential, yet the small move in net margin from about 12% to 11.6% shows that while the business is currently earning solid profits, it is not breaking away from margin pressure as clearly as the consensus narrative suggests.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly EPS range of US$0.05 to US$0.11 keeps growth grounded</h2> <ul> <li>Across the last six reported quarters, basic EPS has sat in a fairly tight band between roughly US$0.05 and US$0.11 per share, with Q4 2025 at about US$0.10 and trailing twelve month EPS at about US$0.33, which shows earnings are positive but not moving in a straight line.</li> <li>Supporters in the bullish camp point to strong clinical positioning and product expansion as drivers of long term earnings, yet the step up and down in quarterly EPS within this US$0.05 to US$0.11 range reminds you that even with those tailwinds, the earnings path has been bumpy rather than smooth so far.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative highlights diversified product expansion and operational efficiencies as reasons to expect stronger earnings over time, while the actual EPS path from about US$0.05 in Q1 2025 to roughly US$0.11 in Q3 2025 and US$0.10 in Q4 2025 shows that cost and revenue timing still matter a lot quarter to quarter.</li> <li>Backers also argue that investments in clinical trials and new launches can support margin improvement, but with trailing twelve month net income of around US$48.6 million on US$418.6 million of revenue, the current earnings base is still modest compared with the growth ambitions in that bullish story.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue there is more to this EPS trend than the last few quarters show, and if you want to see how they frame the upside case in detail you can check

Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E of 15.1x vs slower 3.8% revenue forecast</h2> <ul> <li>MiMedx is reported on a trailing P/E of 15.1x compared with a DCF fair value of US$14.55 per share and a current share price of US$4.94, while revenue growth is projected at about 3.8% per year, which is slower than the 10.4% figure cited for the broader US market.</li> <li>Critics in the bearish narrative focus on reimbursement changes and a concentrated product set as reasons that growth could be pressured, and the combination of a 3.8% revenue growth forecast and a net margin close to 11.6% gives those worries some footing even though the current P/E is lower than the 23x industry average.\n    <ul> <li>The bearish view highlights potential Medicare reforms and possible market contraction as threats to both volumes and margins, and the already slower projected top line growth compared with the broader market shows why those policy shifts matter for future revenue lines.</li> <li>Concerns about reliance on a limited placental allograft portfolio also tie back to the 11.6% net margin, because if reimbursement or competing products affect that core segment, the current earnings level of roughly US$48.6 million on US$418.6 million of sales could be sensitive to any shock in that main business.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics watching that 15.1x P/E against slower projected growth may want to see how a more cautious case is laid out in full through <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener

Over the past few quarters, revenue has moved from US$192.9 million in Q4 2024 to US$171.1 million in Q1 2025, US$260.2 million in Q2, US$246 million in Q3, and then US$362 million in Q4, with quarterly EPS shifting from a loss of US$2.86 to profits between US$0.19 and US$2.21.

A DCF fair value of NOK4,205.12 is very large compared with the current price and also sits well above the single analyst target level of NOK567.60 in the dataset.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to that gap to the DCF fair value and to the idea of revenue growing 13.3% per year with margins improving to 17.8%.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Daiwa House Industry recently restructured its U.S. operations by creating CRC Holdings LLC in Delaware as a holding company for CastleRock Communities, while also issuing consolidated earnings guidance and increasing its expected year-end dividend for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026.</li> <li>A distinctive aspect of this development is that CRC Holdings LLC now qualifies as a specified subsidiary, with capital stock of about US$528.61 million, indirectly 89.11% owned by Daiwa House through its U.S. holding company.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, we will examine how the new U.S. holding structure for CastleRock Communities shapes Daiwa House Industry’s broader investment narrative.</li> </ul><p>We've uncovered the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">13 dividend fortresses</a> yielding 5%+ that don't just survive market storms, but thrive in them.</p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>What Is Daiwa House Industry's Investment Narrative?</h2><p>To own Daiwa House Industry, you need to be comfortable with a steady, mainly domestic real estate and construction business that is trying to deepen its U.S. footprint while keeping returns and dividends in focus. The CRC Holdings LLC restructuring looks more like plumbing than a major earnings swing in the near term; it is designed to make financing easier for CastleRock Communities rather than transform group profitability overnight. In the short run, the more visible catalysts are management’s guidance for FY 2026 and the step up in the year‑end dividend, set against modest forecast growth and recent underperformance versus the broader Japanese market. The bigger risks still sit around leverage, cash flow coverage of dividends and the potential for overseas expansion to add complexity without offsetting returns.</p> However, there is one financing and balance sheet risk here that investors should not ignore.\nDaiwa House Industry's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 15%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-1925/daiwa-house-industry-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-1925/daiwa-house-industry-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:1925 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/39d34d27-af63-4335-88cb-bd5046bbf6e7/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:1925 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community currently contributes 1 fair value view for Daiwa House Industry at ¥4,869, showing how differently individual investors can assess the same business.

Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were US$1.07, compared with US$0.30 a year ago.</p> <p>Across 2025, sales were US$3.62b compared with US$2.82b a year earlier, while net income was US$978 million compared with US$112 million. Full year basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were US$2.56, compared with US$0.31 in the prior year.</p> <p>Alongside the earnings release on February 18, 2026, Pan American Silver declared a cash dividend of US$0.18 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2025, payable on or about March 13, 2026, to shareholders of record as of March 2, 2026. The company described the dividend as an eligible dividend for Canadian income tax purposes and noted that any future dividends will remain at the discretion of its board.</p> <p>The company also updated the market on its share repurchase activity. From October 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025, Pan American Silver bought back 282,700 shares for US$15 million, representing 0.07% of its shares. This completed a program initiated on March 3, 2025, under which the company repurchased a total of 1,650,770 shares for US$46.1 million, representing 0.44% of its outstanding shares.</p> <p>Management has guided to a further 14% increase in silver production in 2026, supported by contributions from the Juanicipio mine and higher grades at Cerro Moro, and plans to release an updated technical report for the La Colorada Skarn project in the second quarter of 2026. These elements sit alongside record 2025 free cash flow and a series of recent dividend increases and form the backdrop for how investors may weigh Pan American Silver’s current valuation and risk profile.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Pan American Silver.</a></p> <p>Investors appear to be responding to the record 2025 results and higher dividend. The share price is at CA$92.37 with a 90 day share price return of 45.83%, while the 1 year total shareholder return of 171.88% and 3 year total shareholder return of roughly 4.7x point to strong longer term momentum.</p> <p>If this earnings driven move has you rethinking precious metals exposure, it could be worth scanning beyond a single name and checking out our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_silver\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473743/top-silver-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">7 top silver producer stocks</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With the shares up 46% in 90 days and trading slightly above the average analyst price target, yet still showing a large intrinsic value gap, is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings of 29.1x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On earnings, the market is putting a 29.1x P/E on Pan American Silver at CA$92.37. This sits above both peers and the company’s own estimated fair ratio.</p> <p>The P/E multiple simply tells you how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of earnings. It is a common yardstick for metals and mining companies where profitability matters as much as production volumes.</p> <p>For Pan American Silver, that 29.1x P/E compares with a peer average of 26.4x and an estimated fair P/E of 26.4x. This indicates the market is applying a richer tag than both the sector and the level our fair ratio suggests the price could lean toward over time.</p> <p>Stacked against the broader Canadian Metals and Mining industry, where the average P/E is 22.5x, Pan American Silver’s 29.1x stands out as clearly higher. This signals that investors are currently pricing in stronger earnings prospects or a higher quality profile than the typical name in the group.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Pan American Silver</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 29.1x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you are paying that richer P/E in a sector exposed to metal price swings, as well as Pan American Silver’s multi country operating and regulatory risks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Pan American Silver narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on value: SWS DCF points the other way</h2> <p>The P/E of 29.1x suggests Pan American Silver looks expensive, but our DCF model tells a different story. At CA$92.37, the shares trade about 57.6% below our estimate of fair value at CA$217.63. This frames the current price as a sizeable discount instead of a premium.

This puts new numbers around how the business is performing today and what management expects next.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for FTI Consulting.</a></p> <p>The 5.1% 1 day share price return after the results, with the stock now at $168.11, comes after a mixed few months where a 30 day share price decline of 8.1% contrasts with a modestly positive 1 year total shareholder return of 2.0%. This suggests recent trading momentum has picked up as investors react to the earnings beat and 2026 guidance.</p> <p>If these earnings have you thinking about where professional services and technology intersect, it could be a good moment to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 top founder-led companies</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With FTI Consulting posting higher quarterly sales and diluted EPS alongside 2026 guidance that points to more revenue and earnings, you now have to ask yourself whether there is still upside here or whether the market is already pricing in that growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 5.3% Undervalued</h2> <p>With FTI Consulting closing at $168.11 against a narrative fair value of $177.50, the current price sits below what this widely followed view considers reasonable, and that gap comes from some very specific assumptions about growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The consulting industry's trend toward consolidation and the challenging macro climate are expected to drive \"shakeouts\" among weaker competitors, strengthening FTI's competitive position, client retention, and potential for market share gains, all of which could result in sustainable margin expansion and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Want to see what sits behind that confidence in margins and earnings? The narrative leans on steady revenue progress, firmer profitability, and a future earnings multiple that is lower than many peers. The key point is how those moving parts line up over several years. If you want to understand the full playbook behind the $177.50 fair value, the complete narrative spells out every assumption.</p> <p>In this narrative, discounting future earnings back at just over 7% and pairing mid single digit revenue growth with higher profit margins creates a path that supports the current fair value estimate. Analysts also assume fewer shares on issue and a future P/E that is below where the broader professional services space sits today, which together help close the gap between today’s price and that $177.50 figure.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $177.50 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, there are clear watchpoints, including pressure on higher billing rates if competition intensifies and the risk that automation could chip away at some consulting demand.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FTI Consulting narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Tell A Different Story</h2> <p>While the narrative fair value of $177.50 suggests FTI Consulting is 5.3% undervalued, our DCF model points in the opposite direction, with the shares trading well above an estimated future cash flow value of $0.16. That is a very large gap.

This ties directly into concerns about elevated debt and C$9b already spent plus C$6b still expected on Baltic Power and Hai Long.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus commentary about step changes in EBITDA from new offshore wind and storage projects is hard to reconcile with the recent pattern of trailing losses, including a trailing loss of C$285.9 million just one quarter earlier in Q3 2025.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Northland’s recent loss pattern and debt funded build out give cautious investors plenty to question in the more optimistic forecasts of future earnings power. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Northland Power Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Slow 1.7% revenue growth versus wider market</h2> <ul> <li>Over the past 12 months, revenue has grown by about 1.7% per year compared to a 6.1% per year forecast for the Canadian market, even though quarterly revenue moved from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025.</li> <li>Analysts' bullish case leans heavily on new projects like Hai Long and Baltic Power and on grid scale storage, arguing that these additions can lift margins from about 2.3% loss making levels today toward 16.5% over three years. However, the current modest 1.7% revenue growth rate and history of wind resource issues and curtailments in places like the German offshore assets show how sensitive actual revenue can be to weather and power price conditions.\n    <ul> <li>On the supportive side for bulls, Q4 2025 revenue of C$725.3 million and net income of C$249.5 million follow Q4 2024 revenue of C$582.3 million and net income of C$126.8 million, which aligns with the view that new assets and better contract mix can improve earnings in stronger periods.</li> <li>Against that, the same 12 month data set still shows the business unprofitable and dropping several onshore and battery projects in Ontario, Alberta, and New York. This pushes back on the idea that growth from here is straightforward or that all pipeline projects will translate into higher revenue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> For investors weighing that slower 1.7% revenue growth against the big project pipeline, it helps to see how others frame the trade off between new capacity, weather risk, and contract quality. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Northland Power Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation sits below both DCF fair value and peers</h2> <ul> <li>At a current share price of C$21.69, Northland Power trades below the DCF fair value of about C$23.78 and at a P/S of 2.3x, compared with 3.0x for the broader North American renewable energy industry and 3.5x for peers.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that expansion into grid scale storage and offshore wind and the use of long term, inflation linked contracts could justify these lower multiples over time. Yet the combination of a trailing loss of C$163.2 million and interest expenses that are not well covered by earnings means the current discount can also be read as the market pricing in balance sheet risk and a reliance on analyst forecasts that expect earnings of C$454.1 million by around 2028.\n    <ul> <li>The spread between the share price of C$21.69 and DCF fair value of C$23.78, plus a forecast earnings growth rate of about 40% per year and an analyst target of C$22.42, are the main numbers backing the view that the shares are not expensive\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n65x0uiq-grid-storage-and-offshore-wind-will-deliver-a-brighter-future-uxos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Northland Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With bulls and bears both making strong cases here, it is worth getting familiar with the full set of numbers and forming your own view quickly.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Chime Financial (CHYM) closed out FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$596.4 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.12. Trailing 12 month figures show revenue of about US$2.2 billion and a basic EPS loss of US$4.27, keeping the story firmly in loss-making territory. Over recent periods the company has seen revenue move from US$475.2 million in Q4 2024 to US$596.4 million in Q4 2025. This has come alongside quarterly EPS that has swung between a profit of US$0.20 in Q1 2025 and a loss of US$7.29 in Q2 2025, so investors are watching how quickly that volatility settles into more stable margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\"

roughly US$1.0b, so this is a business with strong top line scale that is still firmly in loss making territory.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that analysts are pairing this 30.7% revenue growth over the last year with forecast earnings growth of about 116.54% per year,\n    <ul> <li>Revenue moving from US$1.7b to about US$2.2b over the last 12 months aligns with the bullish view that digital banking adoption and higher value products like MyPay and Chime Card can support future growth.</li> <li>At the same time, the current trailing 12 month loss of roughly US$1.0b is a reminder that the optimistic margin assumptions in the bullish case depend on a significant shift from today’s loss making base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some bulls argue this mix of US$2.2b in revenue and heavy current losses could be the setup for a sharp earnings swing if their margin expectations play out, but they are starting from a very loss heavy year.</p> <a

target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Chime Financial Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Quarterly Profit Swings Highlight Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, net income ranged from a profit of US$12.9 million in Q1 to a loss of US$923.4 million in Q2, with Q3 and Q4 losses of US$54.7 million and US$44.8 million, so profitability has moved around a lot within a single year.</li> <li>Bears focus on this pattern when they question how smooth the road to profitability might be,\n    <ul> <li>The very large loss in Q2 2025, alongside much smaller losses in Q3 and Q4, supports the cautious narrative that scaling products like MyPay and instant loans could expose Chime to earnings volatility if credit costs or operating expenses spike again.</li> <li>Even with revenue between US$518.7 million and US$596.4 million across the 2025 quarters, the shift from a small profit in Q1 to sizable losses later in the year gives skeptics concrete data to reference when they argue that earnings quality is still unproven.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors often point to the jump from a US$12.9 million profit to a US$923.4 million loss within the same year as a key reason to treat any profitability timelines with caution.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Relies On Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Chime is trading on a P/S ratio of 4.2x compared with peers at 2.0x and the US Diversified Financial industry at 2.4x, so the market is currently valuing each dollar of Chime’s sales at a clear premium to its reference group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative ties that higher multiple to expectations for faster growth,\n    <ul> <li>Forecast revenue growth of 16.7% per year compared with 10.4% for the broader US market is one reason investors may be comfortable paying more than peers for each dollar of current revenue.</li> <li>At the same time, the company is still loss making on a trailing 12 month basis, so the premium P/S ratio is being supported by growth forecasts rather than current profitability, which leaves less room if those forecasts are revised lower.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\"
