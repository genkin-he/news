            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if DXC Technology is a bargain right now? Let’s take a closer look beneath the headlines to see if this stock could be flying under the radar.</li> <li>Despite a rough patch, shares have dropped 3.2% in the past week, are down 5.1% over the past month, and have fallen an eye-catching 34.5% so far this year. Investors are curious if this signals greater risk or uncovers an opportunity.</li> <li>These declines follow several headlines about DXC Technology’s ongoing strategic shifts and industry partnerships, both of which have stirred up speculation about the company’s future direction. Significant organizational changes and sector trends have added more complexity to the story, fueling both skepticism and hope in the market.</li> <li>Right now, DXC Technology scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> on our undervaluation checks. This suggests real value potential, but there’s more to valuation than just the numbers.

This approach aims to reveal what a business is really worth today, based solely on its ability to generate cash in the future.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology’s current Free Cash Flow sits at approximately $909.5 Million. Analysts provide direct projections for the next five years, and thereafter, Simply Wall St extrapolates further using reasonable industry estimates. By 2027, forecasted Free Cash Flow is around $650.43 Million, with a ten-year projection pointing to roughly $514.09 Million by 2035. Despite a moderate decline over time, these numbers show a steady cash-generating foundation.\n</p> <p> According to the DCF model using these cash flow estimates, the fair value per share comes out to $27.43. This is 52.8% higher than the current share price. This suggests the stock is significantly undervalued by the market.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests DXC Technology is undervalued by 52.8%.

Since it compares a company’s current share price against its earnings per share, the PE ratio gives investors a quick sense of how the market is valuing its profitability.\n</p> <p> Of course, what qualifies as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors. Companies with faster earnings growth or lower risk typically deserve higher PE ratios, while those facing slower growth or more uncertainty tend to trade on lower multiples.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology currently trades at a PE ratio of just 6.1x. This stands out sharply against the Information Technology industry average of 29.3x and the average among direct peers at 20.7x. Such a discount hints that investors may have concerns, but it could also point to untapped value.\n</p> <p> Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” for DXC Technology is 18.7x. The Fair Ratio is calculated with a more holistic view than just industry or peer averages. It factors in the company’s unique risk profile, growth prospects, profit margins, and market capitalization, offering a more comprehensive indication of a reasonable valuation multiple for this business specifically.\n</p> <p> When we compare DXC Technology’s actual PE of 6.1x to its Fair Ratio of 18.7x, the shares look strongly undervalued in a multiple-based evaluation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:DXC PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/01cae35e-7765-4441-9380-6df0f878fcc2/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:DXC PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1405 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your DXC Technology Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personalized investment story, where you combine your outlook on a company, such as its future revenue, earnings, and margins, with what you believe to be its fair value based on your own reasoning or research.\n</p> <p> Narratives bridge the gap between stories and spreadsheets, linking your perspective about DXC Technology’s business prospects directly to a financial forecast and a resulting fair value estimate. Best of all, Narratives are designed to be easy to use and are available for everyone on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share their views.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly determine whether now might be a good time to buy or sell by comparing your Fair Value to the current Price, helping you make decisions based on your specific expectations rather than just the market consensus or analyst targets.\n</p> <p> Because Narratives update automatically when new news or earnings reports are released, your investment thesis stays fresh and relevant as the situation changes. For example, some investors see strong AI and cloud partnerships as reasons to assign a fair value of $18.00 per share, while cautious investors note ongoing revenue declines and set their fair value at just $14.00. This demonstrates how Narrative tools empower you to act on the view that fits you best.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for DXC Technology? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/01cae35e-7765-4441-9380-6df0f878fcc2/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

One possibility is that the P/S is low because investors think this respectable revenue growth might actually underperform the broader industry in the near future.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.    </p> Although there are no analyst estimates available for Erika Carmel-Tech, take a look at this <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>data-rich visualisation </a>to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Erika Carmel-Tech?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Erika Carmel-Tech's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 21%.   Still, revenue has fallen 47% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing.  Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the industry, which is predicted to deliver 21% growth in the next 12 months, the company's downward momentum based on recent medium-term revenue results is a sobering picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, we think shrinking revenues are unlikely to lead to a stable P/S over the longer term, which could set up shareholders for future disappointment.  There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S? </h2><p> Erika Carmel-Tech's stock price has surged recently, but its but its P/S still remains modest.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> Our examination of Erika Carmel-Tech confirms that the company's shrinking revenue over the past medium-term is a key factor in its low price-to-sales ratio, given the industry is projected to grow.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio.  Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Before you take the next step, you should know about the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for Erika Carmel-Tech</strong></a> that we have uncovered.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Erika Carmel-Tech's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

This Shell agreement showcases Halliburton’s edge in delivering operational efficiency and safety, supporting near-term differentiation for its service portfolio, but it does not meaningfully offset the prevailing risks around slower oil demand and regulatory headwinds.\n</p> <p> Among recent developments, Halliburton’s multi-year contracts with Petrobras to deploy advanced production optimization technologies in Brazil stand out. Such wins build on its global presence and technology leadership, tying directly to the catalysts surrounding international expansion and the company’s ability to maintain earnings resilience outside North America.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that, in contrast, persistent regulatory pressures and decarbonization efforts could erode oilfield service demand and...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-hal/halliburton/m6v3al5o-power-generation-and-data-center-exposure-will-shape-future-risk-and-reward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Halliburton (it's free!)</a></p><p>Halliburton's outlook anticipates $22.1 billion in revenue and $2.0 billion in earnings by 2028.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Quickly Is Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Increasing Earnings Per Share? </h2><p> The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually.  That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company’s inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine’s filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company’s current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company’s discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>SK hynix</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ₩32t ÷ (₩129t - ₩25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",
