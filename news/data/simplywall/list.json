Despite big moves in the sector and recent expansion of its power management and imaging technology portfolio, ON Semiconductor’s 1-year total shareholder return has slumped to -30.2%. Its 5-year total return is still up nearly 99%.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

This comes despite long-term value on display in a strong 81.4% three-year total shareholder return.

This suggests upside to revenue as volumes recover from temporary disruptions. Ongoing investments in technology, AI, and data analytics are driving structural cost reductions through improved operational efficiency and enhanced clinical outcomes.

While the recent foundry orders showcase solid customer traction and reinforce product differentiation, they do not materially alter the biggest short-term catalyst, broad-based order momentum in advanced packaging, nor do they meaningfully reduce Veeco’s largest risk of customer and geographic concentration.\n</p> <p> The October 2025 announcement of multiple new orders for WaferStorm, WaferEtch, and AP300 systems is the most relevant recent development, as these platforms underpin Veeco’s push into high-growth advanced packaging and next-generation device manufacturing. This aligns closely with the catalyst surrounding demand strength in high-performance computing and silicon photonics, marking continued validation of Veeco’s core technology in critical markets.\n</p> <p> But despite these positive signals, investors should keep in mind the continued risk if future orders remain concentrated in just a few customers or regions...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-veco/veeco-instruments/ntgzg4es-macroeconomic-uncertainty-will-compress-semiconductor-industry-margins-vi0n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Veeco Instruments (it's free!)</a></p><p>Veeco Instruments' outlook anticipates $782.0 million in revenue and $66.0 million in earnings by 2028.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple. Such a wide premium suggests investors should take a hard look at the underlying growth assumptions that are driving KRMN's lofty valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Karman Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Preferred multiple of price-to-sales 28.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, signs of overvaluation and the stock trading below analyst price targets could trigger a sentiment shift if growth expectations are not fully realized.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Karman Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests Shares Are Overvalued</h2> <p>Looking at Karman Holdings through the lens of our SWS DCF model creates a starkly different picture.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.

Despite upbeat sentiment around the company's innovation, the 7-day share price return was positive.

This sets the table for a deeper look into the justifications behind an optimistic view on future growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing large-scale digital transformation across industries, with CFOs increasingly seeking unified platforms to replace legacy financial systems, strongly positions OneStream to capture expanding market share, supporting sustained subscription revenue and new customer growth. Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts. This is positioning OneStream's cloud-native Intelligent Finance Platform for higher recurring and ratable revenues and contributing to predictable top-line expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jcg9s894-digital-transformation-and-cloud-adoption-will-fuel-market-opportunities-czbv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know what’s fueling such a big fair value gap?

Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development. This initiative is closely linked to iFAST’s recurring revenue ambitions and operational leverage, as onboarding moves toward completion.

Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year. With strategic acquisitions and European growth adding substance to its outlook, the stock’s current market action appears to be a pause within a much bigger, multi-year climb.</p> <p>If you’re interested in uncovering more opportunities, now’s an ideal time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With fresh earnings growth, higher dividends, and continued expansion in Europe, the question now is whether Nippon Sanso Holdings is trading at an attractive valuation or if investors have already priced in its ambitions for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 4.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>The most widely followed narrative places Nippon Sanso Holdings' fair value at ¥5,332.86, which is about 5% higher than its last close of ¥5,073. This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso. Given its expertise and recent disciplined CapEx positioning, this could drive future revenue growth as delayed customer investment resumes, especially with policy and economic clarity.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/810soabx-clean-fuel-demand-and-semiconductor-expansion-will-transform-global-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What are the bold assumptions driving this valuation?

Momentum has clearly shifted, and investors appear to be reassessing both the company’s growth outlook and recent industry headwinds.\n</p> <p> If you’re curious where the next opportunity might be, now is an ideal moment to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>. </p> <p> The key question now for investors is whether Old Dominion Freight Line’s recent pullback signals an undervalued opportunity, or if the current price already reflects the company’s prospects for future growth.
