The story is still binary around clinical and regulatory milestones, especially the upcoming EXPLORE-OSA and EXPLORE-CKD readouts and the planned NDA filing. The new US$113.58 million shelf registration tied to ESOP-related shares looks more like financial housekeeping than a major shift in the thesis, but it does underscore the likelihood of further equity usage in a company that is pre-revenue, unprofitable, and not expected to reach profitability in the near term. In the short run, the main catalysts and risks still hinge on lorundrostat data quality, regulatory feedback and future capital raises.</p> However, investors should also weigh the risk of further dilution alongside these clinical milestones.\n\nMineralys Therapeutics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bbd189de-48d6-4798-a6f0-f98a74374c70/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$41 million to a very large US$413 million, reflecting sharply different expectations for Mineralys’ potential.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>The Nvidia-led cybersecurity partnership puts Siemens closer to the core of AI-powered protection for industrial automation, where operational technology has historically been harder to secure than traditional IT. By embedding AI security directly into control systems, Siemens is tying its automation hardware and software more tightly to Nvidia’s data processing units and to partners like Palo Alto Networks and Forescout. For you as an investor, this points to deeper integration across the product stack and potentially stickier customer relationships, especially in sectors such as utilities, transport and advanced manufacturing. On the energy side, Siemens’ presence in controlled environment agriculture and microgrids links its grid, controls and digital offerings to areas where reliability and efficiency are central buying criteria. Taken together, these moves position the company alongside peers such as Schneider Electric, ABB and GE Vernova in key areas of industrial digitalization and power resilience. The partnership approach also helps Siemens stay connected to AI and cybersecurity advances without carrying all the development risk alone.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Siemens Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The AI-powered cybersecurity collaboration directly supports the narrative’s focus on industrial AI and digital automation as drivers of recurring, higher margin software and services revenue.</li> <li>Greater reliance on partners and complex industrial AI stacks could increase execution and integration risk, which lines up with concerns in the narrative about large technology transitions weighing on profitability if rollouts are slower or more costly than expected.</li> <li>The emphasis on controlled environment agriculture and microgrids extends Siemens’ role in electrification and data center adjacent energy infrastructure, which is only partially reflected in the existing focus on hyperscaler demand and grid solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/awgw458i-analysts-debate-siemens-growth-and-valuation-amid-modest-fair-value-increase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Siemens</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Integrating AI-driven cybersecurity into industrial automation and coordinating with multiple partners may increase execution complexity and the risk of cost overruns on large projects.</li> <li>⚠️ Expanding in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture exposes Siemens to policy, subsidy and project funding risks in newer segments, alongside existing concerns that the company has a high level of debt.</li> <li>🎁 The AI cybersecurity partnership and microgrid offerings aim at markets where Siemens already supplies automation, grid equipment and digital tools, which can support cross selling and longer customer relationships.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts highlight several strengths including value, profit and revenue growth and a reliable dividend, which provide context as Siemens targets growing markets such as industrial AI, microgrids and controlled environment agriculture.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track how quickly Siemens and Nvidia translate their AI cybersecurity plans into commercial deployments across factories, grids and transport systems, and whether customers adopt embedded security as standard in new automation projects. In energy infrastructure, watch for contract wins in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture, especially where Siemens can bundle power distribution, control systems and digital monitoring. It is also worth keeping an eye on how these initiatives show up in Siemens’ order intake mix and whether management commentary links them to recurring software or service revenue, compared with more traditional equipment sales.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Siemens, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SIE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Siemens</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This frames the current move after earnings and new PPAs in valuation terms, not just short term price action.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Extension of production and investment tax credits (PTC/ITC) for geothermal and energy storage projects through at least 2033 reduces capital costs, de risks new project development, and boosts net margins and earnings over the next decade.</em></p> <p><em>Elevated demand for reliable, carbon free baseload power driven by electrification trends (including data centers and industrial customers) is translating into premium power purchase agreement (PPA) pricing, supporting improved revenue visibility and margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/poywhurj-analysts-lift-ormat-technologies-price-target-following-expansion-moves-and-improved-valuation-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to see what kind of revenue path and profitability this narrative is baking in?

This means:\n    <ul> <li>TTM net income moved from a loss of US$33.4 million in Q4 2024 to a smaller loss of US$18.6 million in Q4 2025, so the company is closer to break even but not yet there.</li> <li>Quarterly figures inside that period swung from a US$13.1 million profit in Q3 2025 to a US$48.3 million loss in Q4 2025, which challenges the idea of a smooth path toward the bullish earnings forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, bulls are essentially arguing that a business still reporting a TTM loss can grow into those forecasts relatively quickly, which is an optimistic read on how fast profitability can improve. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l3rwv1up-us-and-eu-refining-will-fuel-a-green-metals-boom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 AMG Critical Materials Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>US$48.3 million Q4 loss vs earlier 2025 profits</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, AMG moved from net income of US$5.0 million, US$11.5 million and US$13.1 million in Q1, Q2 and Q3 to a net loss of US$48.3 million in Q4, even as quarterly revenue stayed in a fairly tight band between US$388.1 million and US$446.6 million.</li> <li>Bears highlight that heavy capital spending and exposure to commodity prices can hit earnings hard, and this pattern fits that cautious view because:\n    <ul> <li>Losses over the past five years have widened at roughly 6% per year and the latest TTM period still ends in the red, which lines up with concerns about long stretches of uneven profitability.</li> <li>Interest payments are flagged as not well covered by earnings, so a quarter like Q4 2025 with a US$48.3 million loss adds weight to worries about financial pressure if similar periods repeat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics point to this swing back into a sizeable loss as evidence that the path to steady profits may be rougher than headline growth forecasts imply. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Materials Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Low P/S and DCF fair value create valuation tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of €33.04, AMG is trading on a P/S of 0.7x compared with peer and industry averages of 5.7x and 0.9x, and sits well below a DCF fair value estimate of €60.83.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests the stock looks inexpensive while still facing meaningful financial risk, and the data backs both sides of that tension because:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the €33.04 price and the €60.83 DCF fair value points to valuation support, even after factoring in that analysts as a group only see roughly 25.6% implied upside to their price target of €41.49.</li> <li>At the same time, the company remains unprofitable on a TTM basis and interest coverage is described as weak, so any case that the current P/S discount is attractive also needs to factor in these ongoing balance sheet and earnings risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie

This raises questions about how quickly capital projects and regulatory outcomes will flow through to earnings.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative highlights multi year capital plans of about US$3b and a pipeline of over 3,000 megawatts of potential new load as drivers for higher margins, while the actual trailing margin improvement from 9.3% to 9.8% is more modest in comparison.</li> <li>At the same time, the trailing 12 month earnings growth figure of roughly 7.2% lines up with the long run 7.4% annualized growth the consensus references, so the earnings side of that story is currently closer to the script than the faster margin lift analysts are hoping for.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Earnings Growth Outpaces Slower Revenue</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew about 7.2% while revenue is forecast at roughly 2% annual growth, and trailing 12 month EPS of US$2.38 on US$1.964b of revenue underscores that most of the progress is coming from profitability rather than rapid top line expansion.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish narrative argue that accelerating electrification and over 3,000 megawatts of large load inquiries can support stronger revenue ahead. However, the current revenue base of about US$1.964b and the 2% revenue growth forecast show a slower build than the more upbeat demand story might suggest.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative talks about potential revenues of US$2.1b and earnings of US$245.2 million by around 2028, but today Avista is at US$1.964b of revenue and US$193 million of net income, which means a meaningful gap still needs to be closed.</li> <li>Analysts also expect EPS of US$2.94 by about 2028 compared with trailing EPS of roughly US$2.38, so while the 7.2% earnings growth rate so far is consistent with that direction, the modest revenue assumptions suggest a heavier reliance on margin and rate outcomes than on pure volume growth.</li> </ul> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that this kind of earnings profile can be vulnerable if large load projects or regulatory approvals slip, so it is worth comparing the current US$2.38 EPS and 7.2% growth to the US$2.94 EPS target investors are building into their expectations before deciding how much risk you are comfortable taking on at a US$40.61 share price relative to the US$41.00 analyst target.</p> <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Avista Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation Support Versus Cash Flow Strain</h2> <ul> <li>Avista trades on a trailing P/E of 17.1x, which is below the Global Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.1x and well below the peer average of 25.5x, while offering a 4.83% dividend yield that is not well covered by free cash flows and interest payments that are not well covered by earnings over the trailing 12 months.</li> <li>Bulls argue that the combination of below peer P/E and expected earnings growth of about 7.4% a year makes the current valuation attractive. However, the flagged risks around cash coverage and interest costs show that the lower multiple and higher yield come with trade offs that investors need to weigh carefully.</li> <ul> <li>The current share price of US$40.61 is close to the US$41.00 consensus analyst target and only slightly above the DCF fair value estimate of about US$37.92, so there is not a large valuation gap that would offset concerns about dividend and interest coverage.</li> <li>At the same time, earnings of US$193 million on US$1.964b of revenue with a 9.8% margin and a 4.83% yield support the idea of a steady utility profile, but the fact that free cash flow does not fully cover\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tw3gqe02-ava-long-term-earnings-growth-will-steady-energy-delivery-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Avista on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Mixed messages in the data, or a balanced risk and reward story that suits your style?

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>Nebius Group’s decision to lean on upfront payments from large customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms shifts part of the financing burden from lenders and equity markets to its own client base. For you as an investor, that means liquidity is tied more closely to contract execution and less to capital market conditions. Long dated agreements and customer prepayments can smooth cash inflows and give clearer visibility over future revenue, but they also concentrate exposure in a small group of hyperscale clients. The aggressive data center build out and the Tavily acquisition indicate that Nebius is trying to move up the stack from pure infrastructure into more software rich, enterprise grade AI cloud services, putting it in more direct competition with Amazon, Alphabet and other cloud providers. That can support pricing power if the platform resonates with developers, yet it raises execution risk around integration, uptime and ongoing capital intensity in an already crowded AI-infrastructure space.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Nebius Group Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The use of upfront customer financing and large multi year contracts directly supports the narrative that Nebius can use partnerships and strong funding access to build recurring revenue around AI focused infrastructure.</li> <li>Heavy reliance on a few very large deals ties into the narrative concern that customer concentration and sector consolidation could make it harder for Nebius to secure diversified, long term earnings streams.</li> <li>The Tavily acquisition and push into full stack AI services adds a software and data layer that is not fully captured in earlier commentary that focused mainly on GPU infrastructure and capacity expansion.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/qronlo1g-nbis-winning-the-dollar174b-microsoft-deal-will-drive-market-outperformance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Nebius Group</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ High capital expenditure for AI focused data centers means Nebius is exposed to cost overruns, deployment delays and changing power or regulatory requirements.</li> <li>⚠️ Dependence on a small number of very large contracts with companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms increases the impact if any single customer changes strategy or scales back usage.</li> <li>🎁 Long term, prepaid agreements with major enterprises can support more predictable cash flows and give management flexibility over how to fund expansion.</li> <li>🎁 Expansion of capacity and the addition of Tavily’s AI search capabilities position Nebius to offer full stack solutions that could appeal to AI developers looking beyond established providers such as Amazon and Alphabet.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth tracking how quickly Nebius converts its contracted backlog into active, revenue producing capacity, and whether new sites come online on the timelines management has outlined. Keep an eye on any updates to the terms or scale of the Microsoft and Meta Platforms agreements, as well as customer diversification beyond these anchor clients. Integration of Tavily into the broader platform, and customer uptake of higher value AI software services versus pure compute, will also help indicate whether Nebius can build a defensible position against larger cloud peers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Nebius Group, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/NBIS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Nebius Group</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

These results focus attention on how sustainable those margins and growth drivers appear from here.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Banco Comercial Português.</a> <p>With the latest earnings on the table, the next step is to line these figures up against the widely held narratives around Banco Comercial Português to see which views the numbers support and which they call into question.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Banco Comercial Português</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTLS:BCP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/72de75b3-191d-4fdf-9666-cea3296eb833/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTLS:BCP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Backed By €1.0b Net Income</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Banco Comercial Português earned €1,019 million of net income on €3,617 million of revenue, which is consistent with the 28.2% net profit margin you saw in the headline numbers.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to higher credit volumes in Portugal and Poland and a shift toward SME and corporate lending as key earnings drivers, and these full year figures show that after a €626 million one off loss in the last 12 months, the core business still produced over €1.0b of net income.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters of the bullish view highlight low cost of risk and capital ratios above regulatory minima. The 28.2% margin versus 26% a year earlier lines up with the idea that day to day profitability has held up as that lending mix evolves.</li> <li>At the same time, the large one off charge inside that €1,019 million net income is a reminder that not all of the recent earnings are repeatable, which is exactly the type of earnings quality issue that more cautious investors focus on when they look past headline growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Loan Book And Asset Quality Signal</h2> <ul> <li>Total loans in the quarterly data sit between €37,378.805 million and €56,345.817 million while non performing loans range from €471.239 million to €526.711 million, so problem loans remain a small part of the overall book in absolute terms.</li> <li>Bears worry that pushing harder into SME and corporate lending could eventually lift the cost of risk. Yet the recent quarters show non performing loans moving within a fairly tight band even as the loan book shifts, which so far does not confirm a spike in credit stress.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also flag Mozambique as a source of recurring sovereign risk, and the fact that non performing loans stay under €530 million across the periods given will have them watching closely to see if that holds as provisions against that market play through.</li> <li>For you as an investor, these numbers mean the quality of the assets backing those earnings is something to track each quarter, especially if the bank continues leaning into higher yielding corporate credit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E Premium Versus DCF Gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a 13.4x P/E against a European banks industry average of 11.1x and peer average of 11.6x, yet the current price of €0.924 sits below a DCF fair value of €1.60 and close to the analyst consensus price target of €0.93.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view on valuation point to forecast revenue growth of 5.7% a year and earnings growth of 9.8% a year alongside that €1,019 million of net income, arguing that the higher P/E is partly explained by these growth expectations. Skeptics focus on the richer multiple and the €626 million one off loss when deciding whether the DCF fair value and the small gap to the €0.93 analyst target leave enough margin of safety.\n    <ul> <li>What stands out is that the DCF fair value of €1.60 is well above both the current price and the analyst target, so you are getting two very different valuation signals from the same set of cash flow assumptions and market multiples.</li> <li>If you are trying to reconcile those, it is worth asking whether you are more comfortable leaning on the 13.4x P/E relative to peers or on the implied upside from the DCF, given the recent one off loss and the description of the dividend record as unstable.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, many investors will want to see how the community weighs the higher P/E against the DCF fair value and the recent one off loss, so it can be useful to read the full discussion in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Banco Comercial Português</a>. <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Banco Comercial Português on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of strong margins and one off risks leaves you unsure, review the details now and form your own view with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>Explore Alternatives</h2> <p>For all the solid margins, Banco Comercial Português still carries an unstable dividend record and a large one off loss that raises questions about earnings quality and consistency.</p> <p>If those gaps around income reliability concern you, take a closer look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">449 dividend fortresses</a> today so you can focus on companies with stronger, more consistent payouts.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new 15% global tariffs sharpen the near term focus on margins, which were already under pressure, and increase uncertainty around the key catalyst of earnings stabilization. At the same time, they amplify the biggest current risk: further margin compression from higher product costs layered onto already soft profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the recent decision to maintain a quarterly dividend of US$0.41 per share into April 2026 matters. It signals continued capital returns despite weaker recent earnings and elevated cost headwinds. For investors watching catalysts, that dividend commitment sits alongside NIKE’s ongoing supply chain shifts away from China, a process that could influence how much of the tariff shock ultimately flows through to margins and cash flows.</p> <p>Yet, in contrast, investors should also be aware that margin pressure from tariffs and supply chain shifts could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-nke/nike/0qyl1fu8-nke-upcoming-product-refresh-and-channel-cleanup-will-drive-performance-recovery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on NIKE (it's free!)</a></p><p>NIKE's narrative projects $50.7 billion revenue and $4.4 billion earnings by 2028.

However, this shorter term improvement sits against that 1% five year earnings decline, so the recent lift does not fully counter the longer term drift.\n    <ul> <li>Backers of the bullish angle may point to revenue trending from S$354.6 million in 1H FY 2024 to S$372.2 million in 1H FY 2025, and from S$748.6 million to S$783.1 million on a trailing basis, as a sign that the business is still scaling.</li> <li>At the same time, the five year 1% earnings decline signal means any bullish case has to show how current profitability can be maintained or improved rather than assuming past patterns will simply reverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic and cautious investors are framing this longer term track record against the latest half year numbers, have a look at what the community is debating around Singapore Land Group right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/U06\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Singapore Land Group.</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 18.9x Sits Between Peers And DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 18.9x, which is below the peer average of 23.1x but slightly above the Singapore real estate industry average of 18.7x. The S$3.59 share price also stands modestly above the S$3.47 DCF fair value.</li> <li>Investors weighing a bullish angle on valuation often see the discount to the 23.1x peer P/E as supportive. Yet that is balanced by two constraints, the slight premium to the 18.7x industry average and the fact that the current S$3.59 share price is higher than the S$3.47 DCF fair value, which together argue for careful attention to how future profit metrics evolve.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters of the bullish view can argue that an 18.9x P/E with a peer discount leaves some room if earnings stabilise relative to the 1% five year decline, but that argument depends heavily on how margins and net income trend from here.</li> <li>Others will focus more on the S$0.204 trailing 12 month EPS and the P/E implied at S$3.59, viewing the gap to DCF fair value as a reason to be measured when judging how much of the current earnings profile is already priced in.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

quarterly prints ranging from a 0.3% decline in Q1 FY 2026 to 1% growth in Q2 and 0.4% growth in Q4.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about pent up demand for renovations and aging housing stock supporting long term activity, and the recent same store sales trend gives a mixed read on that bullish view:\n    <ul> <li>What stands out is that same store sales moved from declines in FY 2025 and early FY 2026 to small positive growth, which is consistent with the idea that demand has not collapsed, even as larger projects are being deferred.</li> <li>At the same time, growth around 0% is modest compared with the stronger backdrop implied by surveys about deferred big ticket projects, so the current store level numbers do not yet fully reflect the upbeat home improvement demand described by optimistic investors.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to connect these small same store gains with the bigger renovation story, it helps to see how bullish and cautious takes line up against the actual 0.3% growth path. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"

value of about US$314.70 and an analyst consensus price target of about US$407.30, while the 2.48% dividend yield and high debt level round out the picture.</li> <li>Consensus narrative frames Home Depot as a high quality, slower growth retailer, and the valuation numbers highlight the trade off investors are weighing:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to high quality earnings and a 2.48% yield, and the trailing revenue base of about US$164.7b with net income of about US$14.2b shows a large, profitable business that some investors feel justifies a P/E slightly above the US Specialty Retail average of 20.1x and roughly in line with peers at 26.9x.</li> <li>Skeptics focus on the share price sitting above the DCF fair value of about US$314.70 and the presence of high debt, and they argue that with forecast revenue growth around 3.8% and earnings growth around 5.9% per year, the premium multiple and gap to DCF fair value leave less room for error.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next

Over the past year, the company has seen quarterly revenue move between US$285.3 million and US$387.8 million with EPS ranging from US$0.48 to US$0.71 in earlier quarters.

earlier, while trailing net income is US$190.4 million on US$1.17b of revenue.</li> <li>Bears argue that rising costs and competitive pressure could squeeze profitability, and the 3.5 percentage point margin move gives them some support, yet:\n    <ul> <li>Trailing earnings growth over five years is still positive at about 1.1% per year, which shows profits have held up over a multi year span even with the recent margin shift.</li> <li>Analysts in the bearish camp still model margins at 21.3% over the next few years, so the current 16.2% level has not pushed bearish forecasts toward a weaker margin structure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing whether that margin step down is a short term bump or something more persistent, skeptics' full case helps frame the risk side of the story: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Case</strong></a> <h2>Trailing P/E Of 23.2x Versus Peers At 40.3x</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a trailing P/E of 23.2x at a price of US$41.70, compared with a peer average of 40.3x and a US Building industry average of 22.6x.</li> <li>Bulls point to this mix of earnings and pricing as supportive for upside, and the current data gives them several talking points:\n    <ul> <li>The stock is indicated as trading about 44.9% below an estimated DCF fair value of US$75.67, which is a wide gap between price and that valuation reference.</li> <li>Trailing earnings of US$190.4 million and EPS of US$1.78 underpin that P/E multiple, so the valuation is anchored in an earnings base that analysts describe as high quality even though recent growth has been modest.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If

US$0.56 in Q1 to US$0.02 in Q4, while trailing twelve month EPS is US$1.78 on US$1.17b of revenue.</li> <li>The consensus style narrative that focuses on long term deck replacement and manufacturing improvements sits against this choppy EPS pattern, and the filings give you a few useful contrasts:\n    <ul> <li>Quarterly net income ranged from US$75.9 million in Q2 to US$2.3 million in Q4, which is a wide range for a single year and reminds you that short term results can look very different from the trailing averages analysts tend to model.</li> <li>Even with those swings, trailing revenue
