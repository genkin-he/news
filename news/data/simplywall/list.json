The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$3.1b and EPS of US$0.08 in Q4 2024 to US$3.6b and EPS of US$0.24 in Q4 2025, with trailing twelve month EPS at US$0.53 and net income of US$106.3m on US$12.9b in revenue.

The latest results and 2026 guidance support the view that volume growth and pricing remain intact, but they do not materially change the key near term catalyst of execution on capacity and margin expansion, or the biggest risk around evolving EO regulations and litigation outcomes.</p> <p>The most relevant new development here is Sotera’s 2026 revenue guidance of US$1.233 billion to US$1.251 billion, which points to mid single digit growth after its 20th straight year of revenue increases. For investors focused on catalysts, this guidance helps frame how much of the expected upside still depends on sustained sterilization demand and successful capital deployment, while the backdrop of elevated regulatory driven spending and EO related legal exposure continues to shape the risk side of the story.</p> <p>Yet investors should also consider how ongoing EO litigation and regulatory costs could affect Sotera’s margins and cash generation...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-shc/sotera-health/za706uvz-shc-recent-equity-offerings-and-lock-up-expiry-will-shape-market-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sotera Health (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sotera Health's narrative projects $1.3 billion revenue and $314.2 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-shc/sotera-health/za706uvz-shc-recent-equity-offerings-and-lock-up-expiry-will-shape-market-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sotera Health's forecasts yield a $20.44 fair value</a>, a 26% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-shc/sotera-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SHC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/81d72a34-9c37-4c95-af9a-b5d1685a5c3b/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SHC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this update, the most cautious analysts were assuming revenue of about US$1.4 billion and earnings of roughly US$255 million by 2029, which sits well below more optimistic views and highlights how much opinions can diverge when you weigh EO litigation risks alongside the potential benefits of Nordion’s long term Cobalt 60 positioning.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-shc/sotera-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 2 other fair value estimates on Sotera Health</a> - why the stock might be worth over 2x more than the current price!</p><h2>Decide For Yourself</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>The 2030 Strategic Plan signals that Colgate-Palmolive is trying to tighten the link between its core strengths, such as brand equity in oral and personal care, and the operational engine behind them. For you as an investor, the interesting part is less the buzzwords around AI and more whether these tools genuinely lower costs, shorten product cycles and improve on-shelf execution across both developed and emerging markets. Using data, analytics and AI-powered tools in the supply chain and marketing could help Colgate-Palmolive respond more quickly to consumer trends and retailer demands, including in e-commerce channels where competitors like Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and Nestlé are active.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Colgate-Palmolive Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The plan to expand omnichannel reach and use digital tools is consistent with the narrative that positions emerging markets and premium oral care as long term growth drivers supported by better data and targeted marketing.</li> <li>Execution risk on restructuring and productivity programs could challenge the idea that cost savings will always be easy to reinvest while still supporting margins, especially if category growth in key markets is slower than analysts expect.</li> <li>The emphasis on AI and predictive analytics in the supply chain is an area that may not be fully captured in older narratives that focused more on product and geographic expansion than on back end efficiency gains.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/a7tksu28-cl-future-cost-optimization-will-drive-competitive-advantage-amid-category-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Colgate-Palmolive</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Colgate-Palmolive is committing to multi year productivity and restructuring efforts, and if these projects disrupt operations or fall short on savings, the payoff from the 2030 plan could be limited.</li> <li>⚠️ The company faces category pressures and private label competition in several regions, so heavier digital and AI investment may not fully offset weaker volumes or pricing pressure in oral care and pet nutrition.</li> <li>🎁 Colgate-Palmolive has strong global brands and exposure to emerging markets, and the 2030 plan aims to use science led product development and data driven marketing to support that position across oral care, personal care, home care and pet nutrition.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts have identified rewards such as forecast earnings growth, a reliable dividend and a valuation that some models view as below estimated fair value, which frame how this long term plan might appeal to different investor profiles.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch for concrete milestones on the 2030 plan, such as evidence of supply chain savings, new product launches backed by scientific claims and traction in e-commerce and omnichannel partnerships. Commentary around Hill’s Pet Nutrition and emerging markets like Latin America and India will also matter, given their role in previous analyst views of Colgate-Palmolive’s growth mix. Finally, pay attention to how management talks about reinvesting productivity gains into advertising and R&amp;D, and whether that shows up in brand share trends relative to peers such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Colgate-Palmolive, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Colgate-Palmolive</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That mix of signals is what many investors are trying to interpret alongside the recent share price swings.</p> <p>P/B compares the company’s market value to the book value of its net assets. This can be a useful anchor for a business like Disc Medicine that is still in the clinical stage and unprofitable. With no revenue, forecast losses over the next three years, and a reported net loss of $212.18m, the market is effectively paying a multiple of the company’s balance sheet, pipeline and intellectual property rather than current earnings.</p> <p>On one hand, the 3.4x P/B is below the peer average of 5.2x, which suggests the company is priced lower than some direct comparables. On the other hand, it is above the wider US biotech industry average of 2.7x, which indicates investors are still assigning a premium to Disc Medicine relative to the sector overall, despite the company being unprofitable and forecast to have no revenue next year. There is also a large gap between the current share price of $66.62 and both the analyst price target of $99.36 and the SWS DCF model estimate of $369.15. The market could move closer to or further from those levels as new clinical data, funding developments or insider activity, including the recent significant insider selling, come through.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iron/disc-medicine/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price to Book ratio of 3.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, there are still clear pressure points here, including a clinical stage pipeline with no current revenue and a recent net loss of $212.18m that could influence sentiment.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iron/disc-medicine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Disc Medicine narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points to a very different price</h2> <p>That 3.4x P/B might look roughly in line with the story so far, but our DCF model paints a very different picture. At a share price of $66.62 versus an estimated future cash flow value of $369.15, the model suggests Disc Medicine could be trading at a steep discount.

The upgraded FY26 profit and ARR guidance reinforces that storyline and likely strengthens the near term catalyst around recurring revenue growth. At the same time, it does not remove the key risk that expectations embedded in the current valuation could still prove demanding if growth slows.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the upgraded FY26 guidance is the most directly relevant. Lifting profit before tax growth expectations to 18% to 20% and ARR growth to 16% to 18% gives more concrete shape to the SaaS+ thesis that many investors are watching closely. Combined with continuing board refreshment and Philip Davis’ initial on market share purchase, it supports a narrative of management leaning into the recurring revenue opportunity while the market reassesses shorter term share price weakness.</p> <p>But against this stronger guidance, investors should still weigh the risk that Technology One’s premium valuation could come under pressure if revenue growth in key markets were to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/software/asx-tne/technology-one-shares/nfnd5wy8-overvaluation-will-encounter-regulatory-headwinds-and-saas-resilience-hxrs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Technology One (it's free!)</a></p><p>Technology One’s narrative projects A$841.0 million revenue and A$224.2 million earnings by 2028.

The new FulcrumAir partnership fits neatly into this narrative: it reinforces PLP’s position in automated installation systems, but is unlikely to be a near term financial needle-mover compared with more immediate catalysts like order flow from utilities, margin trends after a softer Q3 2025, and how the business justifies its current premium P/E multiple. Where it might matter more is on the risk side: deeper integration into robotics raises execution and R&amp;D risk, but also gives PLP another way to defend its niche if competition in more traditional products intensifies.</p> But there is one operational and valuation risk in particular that investors should not ignore.\n\nPreformed Line Products' share price has been on the slide but might be dropping deeper into value territory. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out whether it's a bargain at this price</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92e40fc7-c157-465d-983d-ab7b75e39451/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates span roughly US$77 to US$285, showing just how far apart private investors can be on PLP.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Primo Brands (PRMB) closed FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$1.6b and basic EPS of a US$0.07 loss, capping off a trailing twelve month period where revenue reached US$6.7b and EPS came in at US$0.22. Over recent quarters, the company has seen revenue range from US$1.4b in Q4 FY 2024 to US$1.8b in Q3 FY 2025, while quarterly EPS moved between a US$0.49 loss and US$0.24. This set the scene for a year that turned profitable on a trailing basis despite a softer fourth quarter. For investors, the mix of full year profitability and a weaker finish puts the spotlight squarely on how much of that EPS reflects improving margins versus quarter to quarter volatility.</p> <a

profit of US$80.4m built on much stronger recent quarters</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Primo earned US$80.4m of net income excluding extra items, compared with individual quarterly results that swung from a US$153.9m loss in Q4 FY 2024 to profits of US$34.7m, US$30.5m and US$40.5m in the first three quarters of FY 2025.</li> <li>Bulls point to this move into profitability as backing their view of improving fundamentals, yet the path has not been smooth:\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that analysts see earnings growing meaningfully with forecast annual growth around 61.3%, while revenue is only forecast to grow about 2.1% per year, so a lot rests on margins continuing to support that US$80.4m TTM profit level.</li> <li>At the same time, the risk summary flags a US$326.0m one off loss in the last 12 months, so some of the big swing in reported profit and loss is tied to unusual items rather than a simple, steady earnings path.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Q4 loss of US$25.3m contrasts with earlier FY 2025 profits</h2> <ul> <li>Q4 FY 2025 showed a net income loss of US$25.3m excluding extra items, following three quarters of profits in FY 2025 of US$34.7m, US$30.5m and US$40.5m, so the full year profitability came alongside a weaker finish.</li> <li>Bears focus on this softer end to the year when they question the earnings path:\n    <ul> <li>The bearish narrative notes that the home and office delivery channel has seen low single digit net sales declines and that extra routes, labor and customer support have been needed, and the Q4 loss lines up with that concern that integration and service issues can weigh on profitability.</li> <li>Critics also point to weak interest coverage in the risk summary, which, together with a quarterly loss despite earlier profits, supports their view that the earnings profile can be sensitive to higher costs and financial obligations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are wondering how much of this profit swing really fits the optimistic story, bulls argue that premium brands and merger synergies could keep lifting margins over time, while the latest numbers show both progress and bumps along the way. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rduist81-update-for-primo-brands\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Primo Brands Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>High P/E and DCF gap leave mixed valuation signals</h2> <ul> <li>With the share price at US$22.68, analysts cite an overall price target of US$26.83 and a DCF fair value of US$63.35, yet the stock also trades on a P/E of 102.7x compared with a global beverage industry average of 17.6x and a peer average of 26.3x.</li> <li>Bears argue that this combination of a high P/E and financial risks is hard to ignore:\n    <ul> <li>The risk summary notes that interest payments are not well covered by earnings and that dividend payments at a 2.12% yield are not well covered, which adds pressure when the valuation multiple is already far above industry levels.</li> <li>At the same time, the share price sitting below the US$63.35 DCF fair value and under the US$26.83 analyst target means valuation signals pull in opposite directions, so skeptics question whether the high multiple is justified until earnings and balance sheet metrics improve further.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> For a cautious read on these stretched valuation metrics, some investors look at how bears frame the risks around leverage, interest coverage and payout sustainability before deciding how comfortable they are with a 102.7x P/E. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"
