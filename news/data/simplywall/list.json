The recent volatility in precious metal pricing has affected sentiment across the sector, but it has not materially altered Wheaton's biggest short-term catalyst: expanding production from Salobo III and Blackwater. At the same time, the largest risk remains the future availability of attractive, high-margin streaming deals to support long-term revenue expansion.\n</p> <p> Among recent company announcements, Wheaton’s reaffirmed production guidance for 2025 stands out. This is relevant as it underpins the current growth narrative, linking directly to new output from Salobo III and Blackwater. With new projects set to contribute within the next year, the pace at which Wheaton secures and executes on fresh streaming agreements is pivotal for sustaining its upward trajectory.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that while output is increasing, there remains a risk if... \n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/materials/tsx-wpm/wheaton-precious-metals-shares/dp6ocqmn-analysts-boost-wheaton-precious-metals-targets-amid-higher-forecasts-and-mixed-valuation-views\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Wheaton Precious Metals (it's free!)</a></p><p>Wheaton Precious Metals is expected to reach $2.2 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is.  As with many other companies <strong>PDS Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PDSL</a>) makes use of debt.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is PDS's Net Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2025 PDS had debt of ₹11.0b, up from ₹9.76b in one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of ₹10.5b, its net debt is less, at about ₹530.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/225670672-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761871252616\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PDSL Debt to Equity History October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is PDS' Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, PDS had liabilities of ₹29.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of ₹2.44b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of ₹10.5b and ₹14.2b worth of receivables due within a year.   So it has liabilities totalling ₹6.87b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, PDS has a  market capitalization of ₹52.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.    Carrying virtually no net debt, PDS has a very light debt load indeed.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for PDS </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> PDS has a very low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.15 so it is strange to see weak interest coverage, with last year's EBIT being only 2.4 times the interest expense.  So while we're not necessarily alarmed we think that its debt is far from trivial.        Unfortunately, PDS's EBIT flopped 13% over the last four quarters.  If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine PDS's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, PDS produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for PDS was the fact that it seems able handle its debt, based on its EBITDA, confidently.  However, our other observations weren't so heartening.   In particular, interest cover gives us cold feet.       When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about PDS's use of debt.  While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

The company’s management is also recognized for delivering high quality earnings as profitability rebounds.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-hwbk/hawthorn-bancshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Hawthorn Bancshares.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers side by side with the dominant narratives shaping investor expectations, examining which stories are confirmed and which might require updating.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>SK hynix</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ₩32t ÷ (₩129t - ₩25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

Even healthy companies may need to adjust dividends if cash flows tighten.</li> <li>The watchpoint is whether future profits can maintain or increase current payout levels while still supporting reinvestment and growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Suggests Premium Pricing</h2> <ul> <li>The latest share price of 1,234.00 trades at a significant premium to the DCF fair value estimate of 687.51, highlighting a substantial gap between market confidence and modeled intrinsic worth.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis calls attention to this disconnect, with the company’s relatively low earnings multiple contrasting sharply with its share price premium, raising questions as to whether optimism is outpacing fundamentals.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap may signal either a strong belief that profit quality will endure or that the market is betting on better-than-modeled growth ahead.</li> <li>This divide puts future quarters under a microscope to see if actual results close that valuation gap, or if risk perceptions eventually catch up with the stock’s pricing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

That single transaction was for AU$110k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.022 each.   Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.06.  Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.   </p> <p> Stuart Richardson bought a total of 5.15m shares over the year at an average price of AU$0.023.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Canadian Phosphate insiders own 27% of the company, worth about AU$4.9m.  This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Canadian Phosphate Tell Us? </h2><p> Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months.  The net investment is not enough to encourage us much.     However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Insiders own shares in Canadian Phosphate and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future.

However, revenue is forecast to expand by 16.7% per year, a pace that stands out against the broader Norwegian market's 2.8% annual growth. The company's Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x remains below key industry benchmarks. Investors will notice that despite sales momentum, persistent negative profitability and shares trading above the estimated fair value (NOK7.1 vs NOK4.24) frame a complex earnings picture.</p> <a

percentage points due to successful refinancing, and ongoing IT-driven cost reductions (€800,000 saved per quarter) are aiming to boost Axactor's free cash flow and net profitability.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, disciplined cost management and the rollout of digital collection platforms are set to drive margin gains, with net margins forecast to climb from -49.6% to 21.9% over the next three years.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that new third-party collection contracts, especially in Norway, could accelerate revenue and margin growth in 2026–2027 if cost savings materialize as planned.</li> <li>What is surprising is that despite flat revenue growth in certain regions and recent margin pressure from onboarding costs, consensus expects efficiency initiatives and a larger addressable market to materially lift profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See where analysts agree and disagree on whether Axactor’s efficiency push is enough to drive sustainable profit improvements. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\"

Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Market Share Upside Tied to NPL Investments</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor is strategically investing in new non-performing loan (NPL) portfolios, aiming to capture a bigger share of Europe’s growing consumer debt market and capitalize on a strong NPL disposal pipeline.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that management’s pivot toward acquiring new NPLs, combined with proprietary analytics and IT upgrades, positions Axactor for improved collection performance and higher future revenues.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus view emphasizes the large-scale third-party collection contracts and recently extended debt maturities into 2027–2028 as supporting longer-term growth ambitions.</li> <li>Bears argue that if flat year-over-year gross revenues (down 9% overall, down 1% excluding the Spain sale) persist due to a more “normalized” market, hoped-for NPL-related gains could fall short.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Faces Profitability Hurdles</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor’s Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x is lower than both its peer average (3x) and the broader Consumer Finance industry (1.7x), but the current share price (NOK7.1) still trades above DCF fair value (NOK4.24) and below the analyst target (NOK10.00), revealing a tension between quantitative cheapness and earnings uncertainty.</li> <li>Consensus narrative calls out that to justify the analyst target price, Axactor needs to grow annual revenue to €317.5 million and convert losses of €-67.6 million to €69.5 million in profit within four years, a significant turnaround embedded into current forecasts.\n    <ul> <li>This expectation leans on higher margins, steady share count, and a future PE ratio of 5.1x, meaning risk remains if margin expansion or revenue targets are missed against industry headwinds and competition.</li> <li>Investors are encouraged to cross-check these optimistic forecasts against their own outlook, as the stock currently trades in the limbo between promising multiples and persistent losses.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of

Its current share price of 2772.00 is well below its DCF fair value estimate of 5237.79.</li> <li>Building on the prevailing market view, this discount highlights an under-the-radar opportunity for investors who focus on value rather than chasing momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls argue that defensive infrastructure names like Yokogawa Bridge often attract a premium, so its current valuation could appeal to buyers seeking safety and capital preservation.</li> <li>On the other hand, some caution that the lack of a strong price premium may reflect low near-term excitement, leaving prospective investors to balance stability against potential for fast gains.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Sustainability Remains a Key Watchpoint</h2> <ul> <li>The primary risk flagged is around the sustainability of Yokogawa Bridge’s dividend, which moderates enthusiasm given the company’s otherwise steady performance trends.</li> <li>In line with the prevailing market view, this risk echoes a broader pattern seen in the infrastructure sector where headline profits are solid but payout ratios or future distributions require close monitoring.\n    <ul> <li>Loyal income-focused investors are attracted by the company’s stable record, yet persistent questions on dividend security could limit share price upside if not addressed.</li> <li>Ongoing improvements in profit margins may help mitigate this risk, but a clear dividend commitment will remain central for shareholder confidence going forward.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The company saw a 19.8% share price return over the last 90 days and a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 30%. This solid run, helped by management’s recent move, suggests investors are viewing the company more favorably and could be reassessing its longer-term potential in the auto parts sector.</p> <p>If you want to see what other auto stocks are catching investors’ attention, now’s a perfect time to explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_auto_manufacturers_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/426622/auto-manufacturers/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With shares up this year and buybacks complete, does Nifco still trade at a discount to its intrinsic worth, or is the recent optimism already reflected in the stock price, leaving little room for further upside?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nifco currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.4x, noticeably cheaper than peers and industry averages. With a last close price of ¥4,567, the market is valuing its earnings at a significant discount to both the broader market and its sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay today for a yen of current earnings. For established auto parts companies like Nifco, the P/E offers a clear lens into market expectations for future profit growth or risk.</p> <p>Nifco’s low P/E suggests investors may be underappreciating its recent profit surge. While the stock sits well below the peer average of 16.4x and the Japanese auto components industry average of 11.6x, its trailing earnings growth has been impressive. However, forecasts point to less optimistic profit trends in coming years. This could be tempering the multiple assigned by the market.</p> <p>It is helpful to compare this 9.4x P/E not only to competitors, but also to what analysts deem a “fair” multiple for Nifco. The estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio is 8.4x, indicating the stock looks a bit expensive on this metric.

After a period of strong momentum, recent declines suggest that market sentiment is cooling for now.

This positions the company for substantial systemwide sales growth and a rising share of high-margin franchise fee revenue.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/5i0ew51p-digital-platform-rollout-and-international-expansion-will-drive-efficiency-2cgn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know why analysts say Wingstop could massively expand its profits and dominate new markets?

To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period.  This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. </p><p> Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive.  While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow.  To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive (India) has an accrual ratio of -0.16 for the year to September 2025.   That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit.    In fact, it had free cash flow of ₹14b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of ₹13.3b.    Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.  </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Profit Performance</h2><p> Happily for shareholders, Colgate-Palmolive (India) produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers.      Because of this, we think Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem!     And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.    Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive (India)</strong></a> you should be aware of.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s profit.

So, this means that for every ₹1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of ₹0.09. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Stove Kraft </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of Stove Kraft's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE </h2><p> It is hard to argue that Stove Kraft's ROE is much good in and of itself.   An industry comparison shows that the company's ROE is not much different from the industry average of 8.9% either.   Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 10% seen by Stove Kraft over the last five years is not surprising.    </p><p> However, when we compared Stove Kraft's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 16% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9674015-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761871371113\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:STOVEKRAFT Past Earnings Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Stove Kraft is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Stove Kraft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> When we piece together Stove Kraft's low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (where it is retaining 75% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth.  This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Only recently, Stove Kraft stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we have mixed feelings about Stove Kraft.      While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

With 38% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to ₩1.9t last week.  Still, the 45% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses.  They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.    </p><p> Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Korean Reinsurance. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Korean Reinsurance </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761871432817\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Ownership Breakdown October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Korean Reinsurance?</h2><p> Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> Korean Reinsurance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Korean Reinsurance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761871433884\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Korean Reinsurance is not owned by hedge funds.      Our data shows that In-Soon Jang is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding.       Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.      Additionally, the company's CEO Jong-Gyu Won directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.   </p> <p> On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.  </p> <p> While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Korean Reinsurance</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Korean Reinsurance Company.   It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful ₩446b stake in this ₩1.9t business.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Korean Reinsurance.   This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Korean Reinsurance better, we need to consider many other factors. </p> <p> <strong>I like to dive deeper</strong> into how a company has performed in the past. You can find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">historic revenue and earnings in this <strong>detailed graph</strong></a>. </p> <p> But ultimately <strong> it is the future</strong>, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.
