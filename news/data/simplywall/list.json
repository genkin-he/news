            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced new global tariffs that raised trade policy uncertainty and pressured companies with international exposure, including IAC, while investors also weighed the company’s recent revenue declines in its Search segment and at Care.com against reported profits.</li> <li>The combination of renewed tariff risk and operational softness in key businesses has sharpened investor attention on how resilient IAC’s diversified digital model really is.</li> <li>We’ll now examine how the tariff shock, alongside weakness in IAC’s Search and Care.com operations, may influence the company’s existing investment narrative.</li> </ul><p>Rare earth metals are an input to most high-tech devices, military and defence systems and electric vehicles.

The latest tariff shock adds volatility but does not directly change the near term focus on stabilizing Search and reigniting growth at Care.com. The biggest risk right now remains pressure on traffic and monetization across key brands, especially as Google driven sessions and click through rates evolve.</p> <p>The most relevant recent update here is IAC’s Q4 and full year 2025 results, which showed lower annual sales of US$2,393.19 million and a narrowed net loss of US$104.03 million. Against the backdrop of tariff driven stock pressure and segment revenue declines, those numbers keep investor attention squarely on whether cost discipline and portfolio mix can offset weaker Search and Care.com trends while the company continues its share repurchase program.</p> <p>Yet behind IAC’s diversified story, investors should recognize how much long term value still hinges on concentrated traffic and advertising risks...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac/t7nuw899-iac-share-repurchases-and-asset-sales-will-unlock-long-term-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on IAC (it's free!)</a></p><p>IAC's narrative projects $2.5 billion revenue and $85.5 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac/t7nuw899-iac-share-repurchases-and-asset-sales-will-unlock-long-term-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how IAC's forecasts yield a $47.33 fair value</a>, a 24% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IAC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d51956b7-dbbc-4422-866d-da9fa4000e45/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>IAC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting IAC to reach about US$2.5 billion of revenue and US$238 million of earnings, yet the latest tariff shock and AI driven search risk they highlight could push both bullish and cautious views to reassess how secure those targets really are and what that means for you as a shareholder.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on IAC</a> - why the stock might be worth just $47.33!</p><h2>Form Your Own Verdict</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your IAC research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free IAC research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate IAC's overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Contemplating Other Strategies?</h2><p>Every day counts.

Over the past few quarters the company has seen revenue move from €115.6 million in Q1 2025 to €135.7 million in Q2 and €119.8 million in Q3, while losses excluding extra items shifted from €14.8 million to €6.7 million and €14 million respectively. This gives investors a clearer read on how top line scale is interacting with persistent bottom line pressure.

This sits alongside the current €55.1 million loss on a sizeable €540.6 million revenue base, so optimists focus on the idea that a large existing operation has been slowly reducing its drag on the income statement.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to the pattern of annual loss reduction as a sign the model has been tightening over time, even though the latest trailing twelve month figures still show a loss.</li> <li>At the same time, the fact that revenue is already over half a billion euros while the company remains unprofitable challenges any bullish view that scale alone is enough to flip earnings quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, Azerion's mix of a sizeable revenue base and ongoing losses has led some investors to question how long it could take for that gradual loss reduction to materially change the picture for earnings focused portfolios. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/ENXTAM/AZRN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Azerion Group.</strong></a> <h2>Low 0.2x P/S against sector averages</h2> <ul> <li>The analysis data flags Azerion trading on a P/S of 0.2x, compared with about 2x for the wider European Interactive Media &amp; Services group and 3.6x for peers. This means the market is valuing each euro of Azerion's revenue at a fraction of the level implied for many competitors.</li> <li>Bulls often argue that a low P/S ratio like 0.2x on €540.6 million of trailing revenue leaves room for upside if profitability improves. That view, however, has to be balanced against the fact that Azerion is currently loss making and that the very low multiple suggests investors are already heavily discounting those revenues.\n    <ul> <li>The contrast between a sub 1x P/S and ongoing net income losses of €55.1 million means the valuation gap could be reflecting concern about how efficiently that revenue converts into profit.</li> <li>On the other hand, the size of the discount to industry and peer P/S levels is exactly what bullish investors point to as the potential reward if the income statement eventually lines up more cleanly with the top line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF fair value far above €0.97 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The supplied discounted cash flow model points to a DCF fair value of about €5.52 per share versus the current share price of roughly €0.97. This is a very large gap between the model output and where the stock is actually trading.</li> <li>Supporters of a more optimistic stance see that gap as a key part of the bullish case. At the same time, the fact that Azerion remains unprofitable with a trailing loss of €55.1 million on €540.6 million of revenue is a clear reminder that any DCF output is being applied to a company that still needs to close the distance between its revenue and its costs.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish angle is that if the multi year pattern of around 4% annual loss reduction continues, the current price near €0.97 could already reflect a lot of pessimism compared with the €5.52 DCF fair value figure.</li> <li>The counterpoint is that as long as the income statement shows continuing losses, the market can remain cautious even when model based values point much higher, so the valuation gap and the loss profile have to be weighed together.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The trailing revenue line at US$283.1 million gives that story some support, even though part of the earnings jump is flagged as non cash.</li> <li>At the same time, the sharp step up from quarterly net income of US$1.4 million in Q4 2024 to US$210.8 million in Q4 2025 is so extreme that it invites the question of how much is repeatable operating profit versus one off or accounting driven items that bullish investors need to separate out.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some investors see this earnings profile as the start of a stronger long term story, while others are more cautious about how much of it is sustainable.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/hc9reqtw-aging-demographics-and-lupkynis-uptake-will-expand-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Low 6.4x P/E versus high growth backdrop</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 6.4x against a current price of US$13.97, while revenue is described as forecast to grow about 11.7% per year and TTM EPS sits at US$2.14.</li> <li>Bears highlight that even this low multiple may be justified if the quality of those earnings is weaker than it looks and if profits ease back from here:\n    <ul> <li>The risk summary flags that a large portion of earnings is non cash, so the gap between US$287.2 million of TTM net income and the revenue line can challenge the idea that the stock simply looks cheap on headline EPS.</li> <li>Analyst models pointing to roughly 5.1% annual earnings declines over the next three years run against the very strong trailing profit picture, which supports the bearish view that the current 6.4x P/E might already be factoring in some of this pressure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For you as an investor, the tension between a low P/E and earnings forecasts is where a lot of the debate is happening.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/vvbvvgzz-increasing-pricing-pressures-and-limited-pipeline-will-weaken-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>DCF fair value far above current price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value provided is US$41.93 per share versus the current share price of US$13.97, while the only allowed analyst price target reference here is US$16.67, so both reference points sit above where the stock trades today.</li> <li>Consensus narrative views this gap through the lens of both opportunities and risks, and the recent financials give you data for each side:\n    <ul> <li>On the opportunity side, analysts expect revenue to grow 14.1% per year with profit margins moving from 23.3% to 36.6%, and TTM margins are already described as 2.4 percentage points higher than a year ago.

The key near term catalyst is how well new acquisitions integrate into that aftermarket cash flow engine, while the biggest risk remains its leveraged balance sheet. The latest guidance raise and defense strength do not materially change that risk profile, but they may reinforce confidence in the underlying cash generation story.</p> <p>The most relevant development here is TransDigm’s declaration of nearly US$10.00 billion in remaining M&amp;A capacity after three recent deals. That level of “acquisition firepower” directly ties into the company’s long running playbook of buying cash generative aerospace businesses to feed its aftermarket revenue base. It also interacts with leverage risk, because any sizeable dealmaking from this point is likely to be funded, at least in part, through additional borrowing.</p> <p>But while the acquisition story is compelling, investors should also be aware of how TransDigm’s already high leverage and interest costs could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-tdg/transdigm-group/f88hh54b-analysts-adjust-transdigm-group-outlook-amid-aftermarket-strength-and-softer-oem-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on TransDigm Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>TransDigm Group's narrative projects $10.8 billion revenue and $2.5 billion earnings by 2028.

The sharp Q1 to Q4 FFO move creates tension with that view by showing:\n    <ul> <li>Quarterly FFO in FY 2025 ranged from the US$27.5 million loss in Q1 to positive US$5.9 million in Q2 and US$18.1 million in Q4, which contrasts with the idea of a simple straight line decline.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing 12 month net income at Q4 remains a loss of US$19.9 million, so the bearish argument about weak profitability and capital structure still lines up with the full year picture.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Negative equity and 12.01% yield keep risk high</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing data flag negative shareholders’ equity alongside a 12.01% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings, while the trailing 12 month net loss of US$19.9 million and EPS loss of US$1.38 underline that current income and capital structure remain under pressure.</li> <li>Critics highlight the major risks of a 19.9% annualized earnings decline over five years and weak dividend coverage, and the reported numbers echo that concern by showing:\n    <ul> <li>Losses across all four FY 2025 quarters, from US$13.9 million in Q1 to US$2.5 million in Q4, and trailing 12 month losses that have widened from US$3.98 million at FY 2024 Q4 to US$19.9 million at FY 2025 Q4.</li> <li>With negative equity already in place, those continuing losses are an important signal for investors who are weighing the sustainability of that 12.01% yield against balance sheet resilience.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how other investors balance that high yield against the balance sheet, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CLPR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Clipper Realty.</strong></a> could help frame the trade off in a broader context.\n\n<h2>P/S of 0.3x and DCF fair value flag valuation gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/S of 0.3x compared with 2.4x for peers and 5.2x for the North American Residential REITs industry, and the DCF fair value of US$6.65 versus a market price of US$3.17 implies the stock sits about 52.4% below that cash flow based estimate.</li> <li>More optimistic investors point to this apparent valuation gap as a key part of the bullish case, and the trailing data give them some support but also clear caveats:\n    <ul> <li>The low P/S multiple and the roughly 52.4% discount to the US$6.65 DCF fair value fit the idea that the market is heavily discounting the stock relative to its cash flow estimate.</li> <li>However, the same dataset notes the company is unprofitable with negative equity and a five year earnings decline of 19.9% per year, so anyone leaning on that valuation upside is effectively betting that these reported issues can eventually be addressed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Case</strong></a> <h2>Low 8.3x P/E and US$74.20 price versus US$149.45 DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>Solventum trades at about US$74.20 per share on a trailing P/E of 8.3x, compared with a DCF fair value estimate of roughly US$149.45 and peer and industry P/E averages around 33.5x and 30.9x respectively.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view that the stock looks inexpensive on several measures meets some pushback from the fundamentals, because:\n    <ul> <li>The big gap between the current price and DCF fair value is based on earnings that include the US$1.5b one off gain, so any comparison that uses trailing profit is sensitive to that single event.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 1.1% a year and expected earnings growth of 5.32% a year are both below broader US market expectations, which is a different tone from the idea that the business is on a strong structural growth path.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Interest coverage flagged as a major financial risk</h2> <ul> <li>Risk analysis highlights that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, even after a year in which reported earnings grew very sharply and trailing net margin reached 18.7%.</li> <li>Bears argue that this weak interest coverage, together with modest revenue forecasts, could limit how much the company benefits from cost savings and portfolio changes, because:\n    <ul> <li>Even with trailing twelve month net income of about US$1.6b, the fact that interest is still flagged as a major risk suggests a meaningful portion of that profitability is not easily available for debt service once you adjust for the US$1.5b gain.</li> <li>Bearish analysts also expect revenue to fall 1.9% a year and margins to narrow toward 4%, which, if they were to occur, would put even more pressure on interest coverage than the already cautious risk flag implies.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors focus on these pressure points to build a much more cautious case around

The new 5‑year grade control drilling contract with Capital reinforces that story by showing Montage is already thinking about detailed ore control ahead of the planned Q2 2027 first gold, rather than just high‑level construction. In the short term, the key catalysts still sit around construction progress, permitting, and any updates on satellite deposits that might enhance Koné’s early life. However, locking in long‑term drilling support may marginally de‑risk execution and orebody knowledge, which matters for a company with no revenue, limited cash runway and a share price that has already moved very sharply higher.</p> However, investors also need to weigh how funding terms and limited cash runway could pressure future flexibility.\n\nMontage Gold's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-mau/montage-gold-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how much higher they are than fair value</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-mau/montage-gold-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:MAU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b885ab19-30ec-490c-bf4b-165661c0cf33/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:MAU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Five fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly CA$4.90 to CA$49, underlining just how far apart expectations sit.

Earnings for the past year have been reported as growing 24.2%. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$145.0 million in Q3 2024 to US$165.9 million in Q4 2024, then to US$162.2 million, US$184.8 million, US$198.9 million and finally US$213.6 million through FY 2025. Over the same stretch, basic EPS stepped through US$0.17, US$0.24, US$0.38, US$0.37 and US$0.37 to US$0.36, setting up an earnings season where investors are weighing steady profitability against how durable those margins really are.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Vital Farms.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely shared narratives around Vital Farms’ growth drivers, risks and profit quality.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Vital Farms</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/324f69bb-f700-4940-9dc6-82d2a62f5e2c/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>24.2% earnings growth with margins holding around 8.7%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, Vital Farms generated trailing twelve month net income of US$66.3 million on US$759.4 million of revenue. This works out to an 8.7% net margin compared with 8.8% in the prior year and ties in with the 24.2% earnings growth figure.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights strong brand and pricing power as key supports for earnings, and the current figures partly back that up while also setting some limits:\n    <ul> <li>The 24.2% earnings growth and US$1.49 trailing EPS line up with the idea that Vital Farms has been able to charge premium prices without losing volume. However, the net margin edge of 8.7% versus 8.8% a year earlier shows that profitability is not racing ahead of sales.</li> <li>Consensus points to expanded production and better distribution as drivers for profit. The move from US$576.1 million to US$759.4 million in trailing revenue over the reported periods suggests the company is putting that extra capacity to use, even if margins have stayed roughly flat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Investors who want to see how these margin trends fit into both the bullish and cautious takes on Vital Farms can check the stories other investors are building around the same numbers in more depth: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/VITL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Vital Farms.</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap: 14.9x P/E and DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>On the valuation side, Vital Farms is trading on a trailing P/E of 14.9x, which is below both the 60.5x peer average and the 24.5x US Food industry average. The stock price of US$21.09 also sits well under a DCF fair value figure of about US$476.21.</li> <li>Bullish investors argue that this gap between price and fundamentals points to upside, and the current numbers give that view some clear support with a few caveats:\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 14.9x P/E and 24.2% earnings growth is the kind of setup bulls point to when they say the market may not be fully reflecting growth yet, especially when trailing EPS sits at about US$1.49.</li> <li>At the same time, analysts' price targets in the dataset are capped at US$42.00, which is far below the US$476.21 DCF fair value figure. This means even the optimistic views around the stock are spread across a very wide valuation range.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth forecasts meet high non cash earnings risk</h2> <ul> <li>Looking ahead using the provided figures, analysts expect earnings to grow about 17.05% per year and revenue about 18.3% per year. Current trailing margins sit at 8.7% and reported earnings include a high level of non cash items flagged as an earnings quality risk.</li> <li>Bears focus on that earnings quality concern and rising spending, and the current figures give them material points to work with as a counter to the growth story:\n    <ul> <li>Critics point out that a high proportion of non cash earnings can make profit growth look stronger than cash generation. Even though trailing net income is US$66.3 million, not all of that may reflect underlying cash flow strength.</li> <li>Bears also highlight that heavier capital spending and higher marketing and overhead costs could weigh on future cash generation, which matters if the forecast 17.05% earnings growth and 18.3% revenue growth do not show up in the actual reported numbers to the extent analysts expect.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Vital Farms on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With a mix of clear upside arguments and some real question marks, it is worth looking at the data yourself rather than relying on headlines.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) closed FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$477.2 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.58, while trailing twelve month revenue stood at US$2.6 billion and TTM basic EPS was US$3.13. Over recent quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$620.5 million and EPS of US$0.89 in Q3 2024 to US$703.4 million with EPS of US$1.62 in Q1 2025, before settling at US$657.7 million and US$0.81 in Q3 2025, which feeds into the current TTM profile investors are assessing. With TTM net margin easing from 8.7% to 7.4%, the latest print sets up a results season where the focus is firmly on how efficiently revenue is translating into profits.</p> <a

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Ease From 8.7% To 7.4%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Acushnet generated US$2.6b of revenue with net income of US$188.5 million, which works out to a 7.4% net margin compared with 8.7% a year earlier.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative suggests investors may be expecting ongoing margin resilience, yet the move from 8.7% to 7.4% shows some pressure on profitability that sits against that view.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus commentary highlights Acushnet's premium positioning and operational efficiency as supports for margin strength, but the trailing figures show net income growing more slowly than revenue over the past year.</li> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 9.7% a year versus revenue growth of about 3.1% assumes better profit conversion ahead, which contrasts with the recent margin compression in the reported numbers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Near US$2.6b, Growth More Modest</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month revenue is US$2.6b, and the dataset points to expected revenue growth of around 3.1% per year, which is slower than the 10.3% forecast for the broader US market.</li> <li>The bullish angle that long term golf participation and premium branding can support strong top line expansion meets a more measured reality in these figures.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus commentary links global health and wellness trends and rising participation to future demand, while the 3.1% revenue growth forecast reflects a more gradual path than high growth stories.</li> <li>Claims that digital and international channels could meaningfully accelerate sales are not yet mirrored in the current revenue growth assumptions, which remain in the low single digits.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Acushnet's steady revenue base and easing margins have created a more nuanced backdrop for the optimistic long term story that many bulls focus on, so if you want to see how supporters of the stock frame that case around these numbers, <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Acushnet Holdings Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E At 31.8x And DCF Fair Value Above Price</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a 31.8x P/E, compared with a peer average of 39.3x and a North American Leisure industry average of 25.3x, while a DCF fair value of US$113.89 sits above the current US$102.33 price by about 10.2%.</li> <li>Bears focus on risks such as margin pressure and debt, and these valuation markers give them concrete figures to weigh against those concerns.\n    <ul> <li>Critics highlight the trailing net margin slip from 8.7% to 7.4% and the high debt level, which can make a 31.8x P/E look demanding if profitability weakens further.</li> <li>At the same time, the roughly 10.2% gap between the share price and DCF fair value, plus expected earnings growth of about 9.7% a year, provides a counterpoint that not all of the risk story is reflected in a simple P/E comparison.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors often point to leverage and recent margin trends as reasons for caution, so if you want to see how that more cautious case is laid out around these same figures, <a

The company has seen revenue move from US$4.5b and EPS of US$4.35 in Q4 2024 to US$5.5b and EPS of US$10.79 in Q4 2025, while trailing net income over the last twelve months reached US$5.3b.
