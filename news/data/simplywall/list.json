            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Japan Airlines (TSE:9201) posted a net profit margin of 6.3%, topping last year’s 5%, and sustained its trend of profitability by growing earnings 39% over the past year. However, this pace lagged its powerful 69.5% five-year annual average. Looking ahead, revenue and earnings are expected to expand at 3.7% per year, slowing compared to the wider Japanese market’s 4.5% and 7.9% growth forecasts. With margins continuing to improve and the company trading below analyst price targets, investors are weighing ongoing gains against slower growth expectations and a flagging dividend outlook.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/transportation/tse-9201/japan-airlines-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Japan Airlines.</a> <p>Next, we’ll see how this performance matches up with the current narratives around Japan Airlines, highlighting where the numbers back up the story and where they might pose a challenge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 15.7%, the recent 1-day share price gain of 0.9% hints at renewed optimism after a modest pullback. Over the past five years, the company has delivered a remarkable 183% total return, showing strong long-term value creation even as near-term price swings reflect shifting risk perceptions.</p> <p>If the index move has you wondering what else is on the rise, this is a smart moment to expand your view and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>After a strong run and a fresh boost from its index inclusion, is George Weston still undervalued, or has the market already priced in all the company’s future growth?

For a company like George Weston in the consumer retailing space, this metric indicates investor expectations for future profit growth and stability.</p> <p>At 31.6x, George Weston is valued significantly higher than both its North American and peer group averages of 20x. This premium suggests the market is expecting the company to deliver strong earnings growth or stability.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins.

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.    However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For Yoram Naveh Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> According to our data, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has a market capitalization of ₪15b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth ₪3.3m over the year to December 2024.   That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!      We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this more detailed historical graph</a> of earnings, revenue and cash flow.  </p> <h2>Has Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an average annual rate of 11%.

Looking ahead, analysts expect earnings to increase by 8.49% per year and revenue to expand by 4.1% per year, both slower than the broader US market.
