That single transaction was for AU$1.5m worth of shares at a price of AU$1.17 each.    That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$0.86.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares.   As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.     </p> <p> While Duxton Farms insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell.    You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.  If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/food-beverage-tobacco/asx-dbf/duxton-farms-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Duxton Farms </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/food-beverage-tobacco/asx-dbf/duxton-farms-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"insider-trading-volume\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"872\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/545002494-insider-trading-volume-1-dark-2/1761856408773\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:DBF Insider Trading Volume October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Duxton Farms is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Duxton Farms insiders own 34% of the company, worth about AU$13m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Duxton Farms Tell Us? </h2><p> The recent insider purchases are heartening.    We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions.   But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious.    When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Duxton Farms insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low.      While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

The recent shipment of B1 QSE-5 samples, featuring the Cobra separator process, marks a concrete milestone and feeds optimism around near-term catalysts like automotive partnerships and real-world testing. For shareholders, the path forward is still shaped by critical questions: Can QuantumScape translate technical advances into scaled production and repeat customer billings? While the first-ever revenue of US$12.8 million and reduced losses are positive, the stock’s volatility and high price-to-book ratio show that market confidence is still very sensitive to incremental progress. With management highlighting cash runway into 2029, the operational risks now center on production ramp-up and achieving automotive-grade reliability, areas directly influenced by these recent developments. If the Eagle Line pilot and ongoing collaborations deliver, the balance of risk and reward may begin to shift, but uncertainty about when significant revenues will follow remains front and center for most investors.\n<br/> Yet with all this momentum, the risk around scaling to full automotive-grade reliability still looms large.\n</p> QuantumScape's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/be3f5016-19bf-4bc6-b5ac-31a802792b25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirty-two members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate fair value from US$3.78 to US$37.80 per share, illustrating a broad spectrum of investor views.

The latest series of announcements, including long-term nuclear collaborations and the lease of flexible gas turbines, significantly bolster the odds that Fermi can move from concept to initial power generation as early as 2026. These partnerships with global engineering leaders and supportive local government agreements address some of the biggest short-term execution risks by securing technology, fuel, water, and tax incentives, which were major question marks before. The near-term catalyst remains delivery of the first 500 MW of generation capacity, while successful project execution and revenue generation are now even more critical milestones. However, given Fermi’s lack of revenue, unproven business model, and very new management team, material risks still exist despite recent optimism and price gains driven largely by sentiment rather than underlying results.\nBut investors should remember: management experience remains a key issue for a business at this scale.\n</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on Fermi</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cf0e1010-6f0a-428b-ae71-d75e592ca2cd/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$3.50 to US$35 per share.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (CRNX) shares have shown impressive movement over the past three months, rising 50 percent. Investors are watching closely as the company’s performance stands out in the biotechnology sector this quarter.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Crinetics Pharmaceuticals.</a></p> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals has staged a remarkable turnaround after a tough start to the year. Over the last 90 days, the company has delivered a 50 percent share price gain, which stands in stark contrast to its 1-year total shareholder return of -23 percent. This momentum suggests renewed optimism around the company’s prospects, especially following some positive signals in the sector, and indicates that investor sentiment may be shifting in favor of future growth.</p> <p>Looking to discover more in the healthcare space? Now’s a great time to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_healthcare_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With such a rapid rebound, the big question facing investors is whether Crinetics Pharmaceuticals still has room to run or if the market has already anticipated this momentum, making further gains harder to come by.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Book of 3.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of 3.4x, which falls below its peer average of 7x. This suggests the stock appears cheap relative to similar companies in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sector, based on this specific valuation metric.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio is a commonly used measure for companies, especially in sectors where profits may not yet be material, like biotech. It compares a company's market value to its book value, offering a snapshot of how the market is assessing future growth potential or asset strength relative to peers.</p> <p>At 3.4x, Crinetics looks undervalued when contrasted with its peer group but more expensive than the broader US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 2.3x. This disparity may indicate that investors expect strong future growth from Crinetics, which could justify the premium to the wider industry, yet the valuation still lags behind top peers. However, keep in mind that Crinetics is currently unprofitable, and valuation based on book value rather than earnings is typical in early-stage biotech.

This potentially reverses the long decline but requires substantial improvement from current weak levels.\n  </li> <li> In line with the analysts' consensus view, this projected margin recovery is backed by the company’s shift toward digital platforms, expanding circular economy services, and recurring, long-term contracts.\n    <ul> <li> Full implementation of new ERP systems and digital tools is anticipated to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustained margin expansion if execution stays on track.\n      </li> <li> The growth in sustainability-driven and data-led business lines is expected to increase recurring revenues and stabilize cash flow, both crucial for achieving higher profitability.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation: 136.7x P/E Versus DCF Fair Value of €30.76</h2> <ul> <li> Lassila &amp; Tikanoja shares currently trade at a 136.7x price-to-earnings ratio, far above both the European industry average (14.4x) and its peer group (23.6x). The DCF fair value is estimated at €30.76, roughly triple the latest share price of €10.02.\n  </li> <li> Analysts’ consensus narrative sees valuation tension. Although the stock is well below DCF fair value, analysts’ price target is just €10.50, only 4.8% above today’s price, reflecting skepticism around the pace of margin recovery and the risks to earnings quality.\n    <ul> <li> The consensus target implies analysts do not expect the stock to close the gap to DCF fair value soon, even if earnings growth outpaces the sector.\n      </li> <li> For value-focused investors, the key debate is whether operational execution and margin expansion can deliver enough upside to justify the premium multiple.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/lmh3njcz-digitalization-and-regulatory-demand-will-drive-circular-economy-success-gz6e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Lassila &amp; Tikanoja Oyj on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have another take on what the results mean?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Axactor (OB:ACR) reported that losses have accelerated over the last five years, growing at an average annual rate of 19.7%. However, revenue is forecast to expand by 16.7% per year, a pace that stands out against the broader Norwegian market's 2.8% annual growth. The company's Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x remains below key industry benchmarks. Investors will notice that despite sales momentum, persistent negative profitability and shares trading above the estimated fair value (NOK7.1 vs NOK4.24) frame a complex earnings picture.</p> <a

percentage points due to successful refinancing, and ongoing IT-driven cost reductions (€800,000 saved per quarter) are aiming to boost Axactor's free cash flow and net profitability.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, disciplined cost management and the rollout of digital collection platforms are set to drive margin gains, with net margins forecast to climb from -49.6% to 21.9% over the next three years.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that new third-party collection contracts, especially in Norway, could accelerate revenue and margin growth in 2026–2027 if cost savings materialize as planned.</li> <li>What is surprising is that despite flat revenue growth in certain regions and recent margin pressure from onboarding costs, consensus expects efficiency initiatives and a larger addressable market to materially lift profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See where analysts agree and disagree on whether Axactor’s efficiency push is enough to drive sustainable profit improvements. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\"

Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Market Share Upside Tied to NPL Investments</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor is strategically investing in new non-performing loan (NPL) portfolios, aiming to capture a bigger share of Europe’s growing consumer debt market and capitalize on a strong NPL disposal pipeline.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that management’s pivot toward acquiring new NPLs, combined with proprietary analytics and IT upgrades, positions Axactor for improved collection performance and higher future revenues.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus view emphasizes the large-scale third-party collection contracts and recently extended debt maturities into 2027–2028 as supporting longer-term growth ambitions.</li> <li>Bears argue that if flat year-over-year gross revenues (down 9% overall, down 1% excluding the Spain sale) persist due to a more “normalized” market, hoped-for NPL-related gains could fall short.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Faces Profitability Hurdles</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor’s Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x is lower than both its peer average (3x) and the broader Consumer Finance industry (1.7x), but the current share price (NOK7.1) still trades above DCF fair value (NOK4.24) and below the analyst target (NOK10.00), revealing a tension between quantitative cheapness and earnings uncertainty.</li> <li>Consensus narrative calls out that to justify the analyst target price, Axactor needs to grow annual revenue to €317.5 million and convert losses of €-67.6 million to €69.5 million in profit within four years, a significant turnaround embedded into current forecasts.\n    <ul> <li>This expectation leans on higher margins, steady share count, and a future PE ratio of 5.1x, meaning risk remains if margin expansion or revenue targets are missed against industry headwinds and competition.</li> <li>Investors are encouraged to cross-check these optimistic forecasts against their own outlook, as the stock currently trades in the limbo between promising multiples and persistent losses.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of

Its current share price of 2772.00 is well below its DCF fair value estimate of 5237.79.</li> <li>Building on the prevailing market view, this discount highlights an under-the-radar opportunity for investors who focus on value rather than chasing momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls argue that defensive infrastructure names like Yokogawa Bridge often attract a premium, so its current valuation could appeal to buyers seeking safety and capital preservation.</li> <li>On the other hand, some caution that the lack of a strong price premium may reflect low near-term excitement, leaving prospective investors to balance stability against potential for fast gains.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Sustainability Remains a Key Watchpoint</h2> <ul> <li>The primary risk flagged is around the sustainability of Yokogawa Bridge’s dividend, which moderates enthusiasm given the company’s otherwise steady performance trends.</li> <li>In line with the prevailing market view, this risk echoes a broader pattern seen in the infrastructure sector where headline profits are solid but payout ratios or future distributions require close monitoring.\n    <ul> <li>Loyal income-focused investors are attracted by the company’s stable record, yet persistent questions on dividend security could limit share price upside if not addressed.</li> <li>Ongoing improvements in profit margins may help mitigate this risk, but a clear dividend commitment will remain central for shareholder confidence going forward.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The company saw a 19.8% share price return over the last 90 days and a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 30%. This solid run, helped by management’s recent move, suggests investors are viewing the company more favorably and could be reassessing its longer-term potential in the auto parts sector.</p> <p>If you want to see what other auto stocks are catching investors’ attention, now’s a perfect time to explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_auto_manufacturers_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/426622/auto-manufacturers/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With shares up this year and buybacks complete, does Nifco still trade at a discount to its intrinsic worth, or is the recent optimism already reflected in the stock price, leaving little room for further upside?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nifco currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.4x, noticeably cheaper than peers and industry averages. With a last close price of ¥4,567, the market is valuing its earnings at a significant discount to both the broader market and its sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay today for a yen of current earnings. For established auto parts companies like Nifco, the P/E offers a clear lens into market expectations for future profit growth or risk.</p> <p>Nifco’s low P/E suggests investors may be underappreciating its recent profit surge. While the stock sits well below the peer average of 16.4x and the Japanese auto components industry average of 11.6x, its trailing earnings growth has been impressive. However, forecasts point to less optimistic profit trends in coming years. This could be tempering the multiple assigned by the market.</p> <p>It is helpful to compare this 9.4x P/E not only to competitors, but also to what analysts deem a “fair” multiple for Nifco. The estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio is 8.4x, indicating the stock looks a bit expensive on this metric. The market’s enthusiasm may be pushing it closer to, or slightly above, its justified level based on recent performance and expected outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nifco</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower net income growth and a smaller discount to analyst price targets could weigh on sentiment if profitability does not meet expectations.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nifco narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Says \"Undervalued\"</h2> <p>Looking at Nifco through the lens of our DCF model tells a different story.

After a period of strong momentum, recent declines suggest that market sentiment is cooling for now.

The current market price trails this narrative’s long-term convictions, which sets the stage for investors to dig deeper into the reasoning behind this optimistic outlook.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Accelerated global unit development, fueled by record-high franchisee returns and unprecedented brand partner reinvestment, is expanding Wingstop's footprint in both established and underpenetrated international markets. This positions the company for substantial systemwide sales growth and a rising share of high-margin franchise fee revenue.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/5i0ew51p-digital-platform-rollout-and-international-expansion-will-drive-efficiency-2cgn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know why analysts say Wingstop could massively expand its profits and dominate new markets?

The Q3 2025 earnings report, showing a sharp jump to profitability and upgraded revenue guidance, further strengthens confidence in top-line momentum, though it does not entirely mitigate the heavy revenue concentration risk tied to the TTR franchise or rising gross-to-net rebate pressures. The most important short-term catalyst remains accelerating AMVUTTRA uptake, while deepening payor dynamics and future gross margin compression continue to represent the most significant risks for shareholders.\n</p> <p> Among the recent announcements, the raised full-year revenue guidance stands out as most relevant, directly reflecting expanding demand for Alnylam products and greater near-term confidence following the strong Q3 surprise. This upgraded forecast also offers context to current catalysts, as it is contingent on maintaining impressive commercial execution in both established and new markets, crucial for translating high sales into sustained profitability.\nContrast this with anticipated gross margin declines which investors should be aware of, especially as royalty obligations on blockbuster products increase...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-alny/alnylam-pharmaceuticals/dh7qnju9-cardiomyopathy-launches-and-pipeline-expansion-will-sustain-momentum-into-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (it's free!)</a></p><p>Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' narrative projects $7.0 billion revenue and $1.9 billion earnings by 2028.
