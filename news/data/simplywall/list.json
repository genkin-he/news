At that time, hardly anyone thought about voice AI. However, over more than two decades, the team accumulated diverse experience with this technology, building a moat of over 280 patents that set it apart from competitors. These patents cover a wide range, including speech recognition, natural language understanding, and voice search.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/srfzrzzw-soundhounds-moat-and-diversified-revenue-strategy-make-it-a-voice-ai-leader\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Want to see what kind of revenue ramp, margin shift, and valuation multiple are baked into that fair value?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Hormel Foods (HRL) opened fiscal Q1 2026 with revenue of about US$3.0 billion and basic EPS of US$0.33, setting a clear snapshot of where the business stands as earnings season gets underway. The company has seen quarterly revenue move in a tight band around US$3.0 billion over the past year, while basic EPS has ranged from a loss of roughly US$0.10 in Q4 2025 to US$0.40 in Q4 2024. This gives investors a mixed but data rich backdrop for judging this quarter. With trailing net profit margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier and earnings forecast to grow faster than revenue, the key question now is how durable Hormel’s margin profile really looks.</p> <a

Income Swings and Margin Pressure</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last six quarters, net income has moved from a loss of US$56.1 million in Q4 2025 to US$181.8 million in Q1 2026, while trailing 12 month profit stands at US$489.4 million on US$12.1b of revenue, aligning with the 4% net margin figure.</li> <li> Bears focus on profitability pressure, and the numbers give them some support alongside some pushback.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing net margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier lines up with concerns about margin compression from volatile input costs like pork, beef, and nuts.</li> <li>At the same time, recent quarterly net income in the US$170 million to US$184 million range across most of the last five quarters, apart from Q4 2025, suggests earnings have remained relatively steady even as longer term margins have tightened.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year Hormel’s margin strain has been a key talking point for skeptics, so this mix of steady recent profits and lower trailing margins makes the bear case more nuanced than a simple profitability decline story. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hormel Foods Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>EPS Stability vs Forecast Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Basic EPS has hovered around US$0.31 to US$0.33 in four of the last five quarters, with a Q4 2025 loss and a Q4 2024 EPS of US$0.40 as the outliers, while earnings are forecast to grow about 11.18% per year compared with roughly 2% revenue growth.</li> <li> The consensus narrative that earnings growth can run ahead of sales growth is tested by this steady but unspectacular EPS pattern.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month EPS of US$0.89 compares with quarterly EPS near US$0.33 in Q1 2026 and Q3 2025, which is below the US$0.40 level seen in Q4 2024 and below earlier trailing EPS figures like US$1.47 a year ago.</li> <li>Forecasts calling for earnings to grow faster than revenue suggest better margins over time, yet today’s trailing 4% net margin and flat recent EPS band show that the margin uplift implied by those forecasts is not visible in the recent history supplied.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rich P/E, Dividend Strain and DCF Upside</h2> <ul> <li>Hormel trades on a trailing P/E of 27.9x versus 24.2x for the broader US Food industry and 13.2x for peers, while offering a 4.71% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings or free cash flow, and a DCF fair value of US$48.41 compared with a current share price of US$24.82.</li> <li> Bulls point to long term earnings growth and valuation upside, and the figures both support and complicate that view.\n    <ul> <li>The stock price of US$24.82 sitting well below the DCF fair value of US$48.41 fits the optimistic claim of meaningful upside if earnings forecasts are met.</li> <li>However, the combination of a premium 27.9x P/E, a 4% trailing net margin, and a dividend that is not well covered means the bullish argument depends heavily on the expected margin improvement and cash generation that are not yet reflected in the trailing data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that richer P/E and stretched dividend against the potential DCF upside, it is worth seeing how bullish investors connect these earnings trends to their long term case for Hormel. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hormel Foods Bull

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth right now.</p> <p>For Astec Industries, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s last twelve months of Free Cash Flow is reported at about $28.24 million. Analysts provide explicit forecasts out to 2027, with Free Cash Flow projected at $82.10 million in that year, and Simply Wall St extends those forecasts further using its own assumptions, out to 2035, keeping everything in dollars and in millions.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today under this model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at about $86.31 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $62.34, the DCF suggests Astec Industries trades at roughly a 27.8% discount, which screens as undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Astec Industries is undervalued by 27.8%.

It is a quick way to see how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risks. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can point to a lower one.</p> <p>Astec Industries currently trades on a P/E of 36.75x. That sits above the Machinery industry average of about 28.70x and below the peer group average of roughly 41.03x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Astec Industries is 30.79x, which is its view of what a reasonable P/E would be after factoring in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the industry, because it adjusts for those business specific characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the actual P/E of 36.75x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 30.79x, Astec Industries appears overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Titan International (TWI) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$410.4 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.88, alongside a full year trailing revenue base of about US$1.8 billion and a net loss of US$63.5 million. The company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$383.6 million in Q4 2024 to US$490.7 million in Q1 2025, while basic EPS has swung from a small profit of US$0.02 in Q4 2024 to progressively larger quarterly losses through 2025.

That view sits against a five year history where losses widened at roughly 13.2% per year and the latest TTM period still shows US$63.5 million in losses, so the optimistic case leans heavily on a future margin shift that is not visible in these reported numbers.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly losses widened sharply in Q4 2025</h2> <ul> <li>Q4 2025 net income excluding extra items was a loss of US$56.0 million on revenue of US$410.4 million, compared with smaller quarterly losses earlier in 2025 that ranged from about US$0.6 million to US$4.5 million on revenues between US$460.8 million and US$490.7 million.</li> <li>Bears argue that dependence on cyclical equipment demand and large OEM customers could keep earnings under pressure. The pattern in 2025, where quarterly losses moved from roughly US$0.6 million in Q1 to US$56.0 million by Q4 while revenue stayed within a US$410 million to US$491 million band, gives their argument support that profitability has been fragile even without a collapse in the top line.\n    <ul> <li>The data also shows that over the last five years, losses widened at about 13.2% per year, which fits with the cautious view that earnings volatility and operating leverage have worked against shareholders recently.</li> <li>With the share price at US$9.90 and the business still loss making over the last twelve months, skeptics may question how quickly any forecast profit recovery can show through in reported EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bears warn that the latest step up in quarterly losses could signal that tighter OEM spending or cost pressure bites harder than optimistic scenarios assume, especially if order patterns stay uneven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/lubktl12-trade-and-oem-risks-will-delay-recovery-yet-spark-optimism-1mqc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Titan International Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Mixed valuation signals at US$9.90 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The data shows a P/S of 0.3x compared with a peer average of 1.7x and a US Machinery industry average of 2.3x. A DCF fair value of US$7.71 per share sits below the current US$9.90 price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to the low 0.3x P/S multiple and the earnings growth forecasts as backing their case for upside, but the DCF fair value of US$7.71 being below the current share price and the company’s current TTM loss of US$63.5 million mean the market is already pricing in some improvement. That leaves less room for error if revenue growth of 3.7% per year and recent loss trends persist instead of quickly swinging toward the earnings levels implied by an 11.25 analyst target.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus expectations in the data look for revenue growth of 5.5% per year and margins moving from about 1.2% loss making today to a 2.5% profit margin by 2028, so the gap between those future assumptions and today’s US$63.5 million loss is what investors are effectively paying for at US$9.90.</li> <li>If earnings track closer to the more cautious path, where margins are still only 6.0% by 2028 and earnings are US$124.5 million, the current discount to an 11.25 target is smaller than it appears once the DCF fair value of US$7.71 is factored into the range of views.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these valuation signals to their thesis on margins and growth, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Titan International Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Titan International on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the mix of bullish hopes and cautious signals in the numbers, it is worth taking a closer look at the data yourself and moving quickly to shape your own view.

This update reinforces that tension but does not fundamentally change it.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is management’s progress on securing AI data center leases tied to its Texas power footprint, highlighted again with this quarter’s results.

The Starwood partnership directly supports that shift by tying future growth to large, power‑rich campuses that can serve both bitcoin and AI customers, which may become a key near term catalyst. At the same time, the biggest risk remains execution and capital intensity as MARA retools sites while still being exposed to bitcoin‑driven earnings swings.</p> <p>The Starwood agreement also interacts with MARA’s pending Q4 2025 results, where analysts were already watching for updates on diversification beyond mining. Against that backdrop, the recently announced US$850,000,000 convertible notes offering is especially relevant, since it highlights how much funding this transition could require and why dilution and leverage are important short term watchpoints alongside the promise of AI‑aligned data centers.</p> <p>But while the upside story is clear, investors should also be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-mara/mara-holdings/rieem6ia-mara-expanding-industry-leadership-will-drive-long-term-sector-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MARA Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>MARA Holdings' narrative projects $1.1 billion revenue and $31.5 million earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether E.ON is fairly priced or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article will walk you through what the current share price might actually represent.</li> <li>E.ON's share price recently closed at €19.77, with returns of 6.3% over 7 days, 12.1% over 30 days, 20.1% year to date and 66.8% over 1 year, as well as 119.6% over 3 years and 193.2% over 5 years, which many investors will want to put into context.</li> <li>Recent coverage around E.ON has focused on its position as a large European utility, its role in energy transition themes and ongoing interest from income focused investors following the stock's long term track record in the sector. Together, these narratives help frame why the share price performance figures might look the way they do.</li> <li>E.ON currently has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>, meaning it screens as undervalued on only 1 of 6 checks.

The implied long run dividend growth rate is capped at 1.73%, even though the underlying input growth estimate is 3.39%. That cap is intended to keep the assumptions conservative and aligned with what may be sustainable over time.</p> <p>Using these inputs, the DDM outputs an intrinsic value of roughly €18.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of €19.77, this implies the stock screens as about 7.2% overvalued on this model. This is a relatively small gap and is well within the range where interest rate or dividend assumptions can easily shift the result.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>E.ON is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dividend Discount Model (DDM)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you see how many euros the market is willing to pay for each euro of annual profit.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company's growth outlook and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to line up with a lower P/E.</p> <p>E.ON is currently trading on a P/E of 17.21x. That is below the Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.20x but above the peer group average of 16.26x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for E.ON is 7.16x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable given factors like the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio directly incorporates those company specific drivers, it offers a more tailored yardstick than simple peer or industry comparisons. The current P/E of 17.21x is well above the Fair Ratio of 7.16x, which indicates that the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about E.ON, linked directly to a forecast for its revenue, earnings and margins, and then to your own view of fair value. All of this is captured in an easy tool on Simply Wall St's Community page that compares your fair value to the live share price, updates automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive, and lets different investors express very different views. For example, one Narrative might lean toward the higher analyst fair value of about €18.30 with stronger long term assumptions, while another might sit closer to the lower analyst price target of €14.00 with more cautious expectations. This gives you a clear, numbers based way to decide whether the current price near €19.77 lines up with the story you believe.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for E.ON? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/EOAN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest Topicus.com update, with acquisition-driven revenue growth and a jump in quarterly earnings but a hit to full-year profit from the Asseco Poland S.A. accounting charge, reinforces that Constellation’s story is increasingly tied to complex deal-making rather than smooth headline numbers. In the short term, that likely sharpens the focus on the upcoming Q4 2025 results as a catalyst, particularly around how management explains one-off items and the returns they expect from large equity stakes. It also nudges the risk profile a bit higher around balance sheet flexibility, integration execution and earnings volatility, even if the market reaction so far suggests no dramatic change to the core thesis.</p> However, one key balance sheet risk linked to acquisition intensity is easy to overlook and investors should be aware of it.\n\nConstellation Software's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c7251dc1-43e4-4b4d-943d-ec40ff5f4adc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Nineteen Simply Wall St Community members see fair value anywhere between about CA$3,333 and CA$7,927, underscoring how far apart individual views can be.

On the West Coast, locking in three full building leases in Redondo Beach with a single domestic energy tenant, plus a long dated lease in Rancho Dominguez with a laboratory products company, gives better visibility on occupancy in key infill logistics submarkets. Terminating an in place lease slightly early to accommodate the new Redondo Beach agreements suggests Terreno is prioritizing tenant profile and lease length over a short period of remaining income from the prior tenant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around the Bronx and Queens projects, where planned demolition, interior build out and reconfiguration need to be finished on time and within the US$12.2m and US$103.4m expected investment levels.</li> <li>⚠️ The US$500m at the market follow on equity program could lead to shareholder dilution if new shares are issued without offsetting benefits in earnings or asset quality.</li> <li>🎁 The Bronx asset carries an estimated stabilized cap rate of 5.3% initially and 6.1% after renovation, while Queens is guided at 5.4%, giving investors concrete return targets for these projects.</li> <li>🎁 Long dated leases in Southern California industrial hubs, including one running to 2036, can support more predictable cash flows if tenants perform as expected under their contracts.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, the key questions are execution and capital deployment. On the leasing side, you can watch how quickly the Rancho Dominguez and Redondo Beach tenants take occupancy, and whether there are any disclosed changes to rent terms or renewal activity. On the acquisitions side, progress updates on permitting, demolition and construction at the Bronx and Queens assets will be important to see if the targeted cap rates and timelines hold. Finally, keep an eye on how much of the US$500m follow on equity capacity Terreno actually uses, and at what share prices, because that will shape the balance between portfolio growth and dilution for existing investors.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Terreno Realty, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/TRNO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Terreno Realty</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The Rocket and Redfin alliance directly touches the key near term catalyst of platform adoption by expanding Compass’s digital reach, while the biggest current risk remains that structural shifts in how homes are bought and sold could weaken the traditional agent-centric economics Compass depends on.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the three-year alliance with Rocket Companies and Redfin looks most relevant, because it plugs Compass’s listings and Rocket Mortgage financing into high-traffic consumer channels where buyers already search. For shareholders focused on catalysts around AI and integrated services, this agreement may matter as much as quarterly results, since it tests whether Compass’s technology and data can actually convert broader online exposure and lead flow into better economics per transaction.</p> <p>Yet even with these partnerships, investors should be aware that growing regulatory and platform power could still reshape how much value brokerages like Compass are allowed to keep...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Compass (it's free!)</a></p><p>Compass’ narrative projects $9.1 billion revenue and $275.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Compass' forecasts yield a $13.90 fair value</a>, a 39% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1de63fb6-70ab-4048-a072-49ee626a6c2a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest ranked analysts were assuming only about 11.6 percent annual revenue growth to roughly US$8.7 billion and modest 1.9 percent margins by 2028, so if you worry that tech platforms could eventually marginalize Compass’s agent model, this new Rocket and Redfin partnership might either soften or reinforce that concern depending on how much value you think flows to Compass versus its partners.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Compass</a> - why the stock might be worth just $11.00!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

Looking back, revenue has moved from €37.5b in the first half of 2024 to €36.3b in the second half and then to €38.1b in the first half of 2025, while basic EPS has shifted from €0.78 to €0.88 and then to €1.16.

This keeps the consensus focus on execution and cost control very relevant.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 18.7x vs peers at 29.4x</h2> <ul> <li>Engie is trading on a P/E of 18.7x, below both the peer average of 29.4x and the Global Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.1x, with a current share price of €29.53.</li> <li>Supporters of the more bullish arguments see this lower P/E and the DCF fair value gap as a valuation opportunity, but the earnings and margin profile keep that view grounded in some clear trade offs:\n    <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of €43.90 sits well above the current €29.53 share price, and trailing 12 month net income of €3.8b with basic EPS of €1.52 shows the business is profitable. This heavily supports the idea that the stock is not priced like its estimated cash flows.</li> <li>However, forecast earnings growth of about 6% per year and revenue growth of about 2.4% per year, both slower than the French market figures cited, plus a 5.3% net margin slightly below 5.5% last year, give bulls less of a growth argument and more of a value argument based on today’s multiples.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic investors connect this valuation gap to Engie’s long term projects, check out the dedicated bull case for more context on where they think the upside could come from. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Engie Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>5.01% dividend with weak coverage</h2> <ul> <li>Engie’s dividend yield is 5.01%, but dividend payments are described as not well covered by free cash flow, and interest payments are not well covered by earnings, even though trailing 12 month net income is €3.8b.</li> <li>Critics in the more bearish camp focus on these payout and financing pressures, and the numbers here line up closely with those concerns:\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 5.3% net margin and weak interest coverage means a meaningful chunk of profit is already spoken for by financing costs. This supports the bearish view that higher leverage could limit flexibility if conditions get tougher.</li> <li>On top of that, the 5.01% yield not being well backed by free cash flow fits the worry that, even with net income of €2.8b in H1 2025 and €3.8b over the last 12 months, cash generation may not comfortably fund both dividends and planned investments at the same time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that 5.01% yield against the balance sheet strains, it is worth reading how skeptics frame the downside risks before you decide where you stand. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Engie Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tn3mpuws-engi-renewable-projects-and-power-agreements-will-offset-valuation-risks-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Engie on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Reading these numbers you can probably see both the appeal and the worry, so do not wait too long to check the full picture for yourself.

Over recent periods the company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$435.2 million to US$503.4 million while basic EPS stayed in loss making territory between US$0.23 and US$0.70 per share.

This sets up a clear tension between market pricing and that valuation view.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Zion Bank will be releasing their Quarterly Earnings Report on 10-21-24. Four out of four of their last reports were all beats. Two out of the four were major blowouts. The thing with most banks is that they move slowly until they release their reports. Zion is a small banking firm. For the last 3 months they are only up 1.41%. However, for the past month they are up 7%. How is this? Our market and its volatility. Currently only $50 a share. This is a company that some investors may view as a strong candidate, especially with the importance of their earnings release. Why wouldn't you want to catch that spike? They are being estimated to see a 15% move once the report is released. Our information suggests this could be a major event for this bank, and this small firm could attract significant news coverage.

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>For Morningstar, launching the Foundation Series CITs and bringing in Scott Brown point to a tighter link between product development and the technology that delivers it. The multi manager CIT structure leans on Morningstar’s research and managed accounts framework, while Brown’s background at Experian and Nielsen is rooted in large scale data platforms and AI enabled tools. Together, that suggests Morningstar is trying to make its retirement offerings more modular and easier to plug into recordkeeper systems, which can matter for distribution when you compare it with platforms offered by peers like BlackRock, Fidelity, or S&amp;P Global.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Morningstar carries a high level of debt, which gives it less flexibility if new product bets or platform investments do not land with clients as expected.</li> <li>⚠️ Integrating new leadership and expanding AI focused platforms across asset and wealth management could be complex, and execution risk may show up in slower delivery or higher costs.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings have grown 17.9% per year over the past 5 years, which shows the existing model has supported profitable expansion while the company invests in new offerings.</li> <li>🎁 The P/E ratio of 19.3x is slightly below the US market at 19.4x, which may appeal to investors who see value in a business combining data, research, and retirement focused products.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly plan sponsors and recordkeepers adopt the Foundation Series CITs, including how often they appear in plan menus alongside competing products. For Scott Brown, investors can track whether Morningstar’s direct platform starts to show faster product rollouts or clearer AI enabled features that tie public and private market data together. You can also watch how revenue, margins, and debt trends evolve as Morningstar invests in these areas, particularly given the recent 39% drop in the share price over six months, to see whether execution on this leadership and product shift feeds through to the financials.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Morningstar, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/MORN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Morningstar</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
