However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 4.6%.    </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last Year </h2> <p> In fact, the recent sale by Non-Executive Director Alan Steele was not their only sale of Mayfield Group Holdings shares this year.  Earlier in the year, they fetched AU$1.36 per share in a -AU$2.7m sale.     That means that even when the share price was below the current price of AU$1.95, an insider wanted to cash in some shares.  We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Alan Steele's holding.    </p> <p> Alan Steele divested 2.49m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of AU$1.44.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership.   Mayfield Group Holdings insiders own 64% of the company, currently worth about AU$122m based on the recent share price.  Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> An insider hasn't  bought Mayfield Group Holdings stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.     Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying.    On the plus side, Mayfield Group Holdings makes money, and is growing profits.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Mayfield Group Holdings.

Net profit margin dropped to 11.7% from last year’s 13.7%, and the bottom line was boosted by a one-off CA$290.0 million gain. Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow at 4.1% per year, trailing the Canadian market’s 5%, while earnings are expected to accelerate by 21.3% per year, pacing well ahead of the sector. Investors are weighing this strong growth outlook against a premium 27x P/E ratio as well as notable risks around financial quality, share dilution, and dividend sustainability.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Capital Power.</a> <p>Next up, we’ll see how the headline figures fit alongside the current narratives.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing. Expectations are high, and any disappointment on growth or margins could weigh on the shares.</li> <li>Investors may want to examine whether guided earnings growth and margin forecasts are truly achievable in light of competitive and market risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how the broader consensus narrative stacks up against these latest financial figures, check out the full story in the analyst consensus breakdown. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Capital Power Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Capital Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Do these figures tell a different story to you?

Watts trades at 29.2x earnings, noticeably higher than both the industry average of 24.6x and the peer average of 28.7x. The fair ratio, which could be the level the market moves toward, is just 21.1x. This premium signals the market expects outsized growth or rewards quality.

The recently announced joint project with Samsung SDI and BMW is a clear positive for Solid Power’s product validation efforts, potentially accelerating its timeline toward market entry, however, the short-term financial impact and mitigation of its concentration risk are still uncertain.\n</p> <p> Of all recent announcements, the expanded partnership with SK On (expected to generate at least US$50 million in revenue) stands out as a potentially relevant catalyst. This agreement, combined with the Samsung SDI and BMW collaboration, highlights increasing industry traction even as Solid Power faces ongoing cash burn and high capital requirements that could pressure its liquidity if losses persist.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be aware that reliance on a handful of major partners remains a key risk if expectations around commercial adoption or ongoing commitments do not fully materialize...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-sldp/solid-power/v38tuaov-sldp-future-gains-will-be-constrained-by-prolonged-overvaluation-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Solid Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>Solid Power's narrative projects $33.2 million in revenue and $1.6 million in earnings by 2028.

Revenue is forecast to decline by 4.7% per year over the next three years, while EPS is expected to grow at a rate of 5.53% annually.

This perspective is underlined by concerns over rising capital requirements and the pace of Equinor’s renewables expansion.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that while Equinor’s low multiple offers immediate value, it may also reflect caution about the sustainability of high dividends as legacy oil and gas fields mature.</li> <li>The consensus also points out that persistent optimism assumes offshore wind and renewables will offset margin pressures. Recent U.S. offshore wind impairments highlight the difficulty of rapidly replacing oil cash flows with profitable renewable income.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>What is striking is how this valuation mismatch shapes market expectations for fair pricing and future returns.

Ongoing profit growth and new long-term gas contracts could add upside.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus highlights that the fair value premium is only meaningful if projected margin improvements and cash flows from new projects materialize amid regulatory and price risks.</li> <li>This wide discount, combined with moderate analyst price targets near current levels, shows how the market is balancing potential upside with caution about decarbonization and energy transition headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Equinor on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different interpretation of the data?

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 283% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 8.7% per annum over the next three years.  Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 20% each year, which paints a poor picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that SK hynix's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From SK hynix's P/E? </h2><p> Despite SK hynix's shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of SK hynix's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> You always need to take note of risks, for example -<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>SK hynix has 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of SK hynix's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

It emphasizes that\n    <ul> <li> the shift away from hardware and legacy contracts is creating persistent topline headwinds, and\n      </li> <li> reliance on acquisitions plus intense competition may limit organic innovation, challenging the durability of recent gains.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>PE Ratio and DCF Valuation Suggest Potential Upside</h2> <ul> <li> At a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x and a share price of $11.4, OneSpan trades far below its DCF fair value of $23.66 and the US Software industry average P/E of 34.1x.\n  </li> <li> In the analysts' consensus view, this deep discount reflects skepticism about sustaining profitability. However, it leaves the door open for re-rating if execution improves or recurring revenues stabilize faster than expected, because\n    <ul> <li> the consensus price target of $18.50 implies roughly 62% upside from here, even as forecasts anticipate a shrinking bottom line, and\n      </li> <li> positive catalysts like cross-selling and new product innovation could drive a reassessment if current headwinds are overcome.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OneSpan on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own interpretation of the latest figures?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if Nu Holdings is a hidden gem or just another growth story? If you’re curious about whether now is the right time to buy in, you’re not alone.</li> <li>The stock has climbed 51.6% year-to-date and is up 6.1% over the past month, signaling renewed excitement and a possible shift in how investors see its future potential and risks.</li> <li>Recent headlines have spotlighted Nu’s strategic expansion across new Latin American markets and ongoing product launches.

These developments are fueling speculation that Nu could keep outpacing rivals and capture fresh growth opportunities.</li> <li>Looking at the numbers, Nu Holdings currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a> on our valuation checks for being undervalued, which might surprise some after its run-up.

Unlike models that focus only on cash flows, this approach centers on the company’s ability to generate “excess” profits from its equity base.</p> <p>For Nu Holdings, the data tells a clear story. The company’s average return on equity is an impressive 29.42%, while its stable book value is estimated at $3.04 per share by six analysts. The stable earnings per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity from nine analysts, stands at $0.90. The cost of equity is $0.36 per share, so the excess return currently generated is $0.53 per share.</p> <p>While strong returns on capital may be a positive sign, the model estimates an intrinsic value that is much lower than today’s price. The Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings is trading at a 76.9% premium to its fair value, which may indicate that the stock is significantly overvalued at present.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Nu Holdings may be overvalued by 76.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 834 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NU Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Nu Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Nu Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often viewed as one of the best ways to quickly assess value. The PE multiple captures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings and is especially useful when profits are stable and growing. Higher growth prospects and lower risks typically justify a higher \"normal\" PE ratio. More volatile earnings or higher uncertainties mean investors may expect a lower multiple.</p> <p>Nu Holdings currently trades at a PE ratio of 33.85x. For context, the Banks industry average PE is 11.16x, and its peer group averages 11.48x, suggesting Nu is commanding a significant premium to both benchmarks. This premium usually reflects higher anticipated growth, stronger profitability, or lower perceived risk.</p> <p>Rather than relying solely on these market benchmarks, Simply Wall St introduces the concept of a Fair Ratio, a PE multiple tailored to Nu Holdings' unique profile, including factors like forecast earnings growth, profit margins, industry dynamics, market capitalization, and risk. This approach offers a more individualized, thorough comparison than simple peer or industry averages.</p> <p>Nu Holdings’ Fair Ratio is calculated at 22.69x, meaning the current PE of 33.85x is noticeably higher. This sizeable gap suggests the market is pricing in an ambitious growth scenario that may not be fully supported by the fundamentals as they stand today.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Nu Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, personalized investment story that connects your view of Nu Holdings' future to a concrete forecast of its revenue, profits, and margins. This turns your perspective into an estimate of fair value, not just a gut feeling.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's platform, Narratives are an easy-to-use tool found on the Community page, enabling millions of investors to link real company stories to live financial forecasts and fair value estimates. Narratives allow you to confidently decide when to buy or sell by comparing your assumed fair value (based on your expectations) to the current market price, so you are always investing within your framework.</p> <p>What makes this tool powerful is that Narratives update dynamically as news or earnings releases come in, ensuring your valuation stays current with fresh data. For example, one investor may believe Nu can keep growing fast and assigns a high fair value of $20 per share, while another, more cautious, sees risks from increased competition and values it at $14. Both are using the same Narrative system but very different assumptions.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Nu Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-nu/nu-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f5a92141-e0e0-499f-9781-47a85da2384d/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NU Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Forecasts show the company is not expected to return to profitability within the next three years, and revenue growth is projected at just 0.6% per year. This lags well behind the broader US market’s 10.3% annual rate.

This supports cash flow stability and reduces churn risk, even as the company faces top-line pressures.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that the accelerating adoption of generative AI research tools and deeper coverage of digital transformation topics are giving Forrester increased leverage with clients. This has led to improved subscription growth and pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that innovative frameworks like the Total Experience Score have enabled longer contracts and stronger client retention.</li> <li>At the same time, new government contract wins and a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in the sales pipeline point to revenue diversification and potential future stability, despite near-term declines.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Deep Relative Discount Signals Value Disconnect</h2> <ul> <li>Forrester trades at a 0.3x price-to-sales ratio. This is well below the US professional services industry average of 1.3x and the peer average of 5.4x, suggesting the market reflects pessimism about future prospects.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view underscores that while Forrester's DCF fair value is estimated at $14.55 and the analyst price target sits at $12.00, the current share price is just $7.13. This indicates a wide perceived discount. Consensus expects profitability and stability to improve if retention efforts and operational shifts are successful.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap is especially notable given the sector’s 10.3% annual growth benchmark, compared to Forrester’s much lower 0.6% forecasted pace.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests investors must consider whether deep discounts sufficiently compensate for slower growth, given analyst hopes for a turnaround in client engagement and margins.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Operational Pressures Continue to Weigh</h2> <ul> <li>Operating expenses have declined by 6%, primarily due to a 12% reduction in headcount, as Forrester seeks to control losses and protect margins during ongoing sales and client retention challenges.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view draws attention to sustained revenue declines across research, consulting, and events, including an 8% overall revenue drop year-over-year. This highlights substantial pressures on topline stability and raises important questions about the speed of potential recovery.\n    <ul> <li>Critics note that wallet retention and contract value have also slipped, down 1% and 7%, respectively, signaling ongoing client budget tightening driven by macroeconomic factors.</li> <li>Consensus narrative also notes that while the company's cost management efforts have supported margins, these measures could constrain capacity for innovation and limit long-term upside if trends do not reverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.  That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least.     </p><p> After losing 3.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Redeia Corporación (BME:RED) is forecasting earnings growth of 5.23% per year and expects revenue to rise 4.8% annually, which is ahead of the broader Spanish market's 4.2% growth outlook. Despite these positive projections, the company's net profit margin has slipped from 33.6% to 30%, and reported earnings have decreased at a rate of 5.5% per year over the last five years. Although the stock is trading at a premium, with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 16.6x that surpasses both its peers (14.9x) and the industry average (13.3x), the current share price of €15.61 also remains above the estimated fair value of €13.75.

These factors help counter the recent drop in net profit margin.</li> <li>New regulatory incentives and higher projected EBITDA indicate that long-term investments could help stabilize or lift profitability, even as capital expenditure ramps up.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rising Capital Investment, Rising Risks</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia plans average annual capital expenditures of at least €1.5 billion through 2028, well above previous levels and industry norms, with major projects reinforcing the Spanish power network and interconnections.</li> <li> The consensus narrative notes that these heavy investments grow the regulated asset base and strengthen future revenue streams, yet bring notable risk:\n    <ul> <li>Operational and financial stress is cited as a risk. Ambitious spending could overload balance sheet leverage and pressure free cash flow if subsidies or disposals do not materialize as planned.</li> <li>S&amp;P's placement of Redeia on negative CreditWatch underscores the concern that costly upgrades and regulatory uncertainty may elevate credit risk and funding costs over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Stays Stretched Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia's current share price (€15.61) sits well above the DCF fair value estimate of €13.75 and implies a PE ratio of 16.6x, higher than both its peer group (14.9x) and the European Electric Utilities sector (13.3x).</li> <li> Analysts’ consensus view underscores the persistent premium. To match the long-term analyst price target of €17.86, investors must believe in sustained robust growth and margin recovery.\n    <ul> <li>The requirement for Redeia to trade at 19.5x PE on 2028 earnings shows the valuation is already baking in meaningful upside. This may leave little margin for error if growth or regulation disappoints.</li> <li>This premium reflects optimism about investment-led gains but creates valuation sensitivity if margin improvements or capital returns lag expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Analyst forecasts and fundamental trends show Redeia's profile is defined by the balancing act between ambitious, capex-driven growth and the risks of cost overruns, margin pressure, and valuation stretch.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Redeia Corporación Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Redeia Corporación on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Want to interpret the data through your own lens?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Mitsubishi (TSE:8058) has steadily gained attention this month as its stock performance continues to build on earlier momentum. Investors are watching its returns closely, particularly after a series of consistent gains over the past quarter.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-8058/mitsubishi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Mitsubishi.</a></p> <p>Mitsubishi’s stock has kept up impressive momentum, with a 22.6% share price return over the past 90 days and a 39.7% total shareholder return for investors over the last year. Recent price gains add to a longer streak of outperformance, suggesting that market confidence in its prospects is building rather than fading.</p> <p>If Mitsubishi’s strong run has you thinking bigger, now is an ideal time to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With such strong returns and solid growth figures on the books, the key question becomes whether Mitsubishi's current price has already factored in all the good news, or if there may still be a real buying opportunity ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 9% Overvalued</h2> <p>Mitsubishi’s last close of ¥3,712 sits above the fair value estimate set by the most popular narrative, suggesting the stock may be priced ahead of its fundamentals at the moment. Enthusiasm around future investments and operational pivots provides a compelling backdrop for deeper analysis.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Significant strategic investments and first shipments in LNG, renewable fuels, and expansion in seafood and farming position Mitsubishi to benefit from the global energy transition and rising food demand. This supports future revenue and earnings growth. Active capital recycling and selective divestitures of lower-margin businesses align the portfolio toward higher-margin and recurring revenue streams, which is likely to enhance net margins and improve return on equity over the medium term.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ksmocpod-renewable-fuels-and-lng-will-shape-a-global-energy-transition-iikt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what assumptions are behind this assertive valuation?

Investors seem to be rewarding both recent earnings outperformance and the bank’s ability to grow loans and deposits.

At a last close of $106.5, this premium valuation raises the question of whether it is reflective of genuine business momentum or a sign of over-optimism.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio tells investors how much they are paying today for each dollar of company earnings. For banks, a lower P/E can point to market concern over growth or credit quality, while a higher P/E may imply a strong earnings outlook or investor appetite for risk. In this case, Coastal Financial’s elevated P/E highlights market confidence in its future earnings growth but also sets a high bar for actual performance.</p> <p>Compared to its main benchmarks, Coastal Financial’s P/E is much higher than the US Banks industry average of 11.2x and the peer group average of 11.6x. The fair price-to-earnings ratio, estimated at 20.6x by regression analysis, suggests current levels are running high and could face downward adjustment if results disappoint or growth slows.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ccb/coastal-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Coastal Financial</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 33.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, earnings momentum could stall if loan growth slows or if higher rates begin to pressure deposit costs and margins.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ccb/coastal-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Coastal Financial narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: The SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-earnings ratio points to a premium valuation, the SWS DCF model offers a different perspective.
