            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB) has wrapped up FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$349.0 million, a basic EPS loss of US$0.23, and trailing twelve month revenue of about US$1.5 billion alongside a full year basic EPS loss of US$0.90. This gives investors a clear view of where the top line stands in relation to still negative earnings. The company has reported quarterly revenue moving from US$404.5 million in Q3 2024 to US$349.0 million in Q4 2025, while quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$0.51 in Q4 2024 to a loss of US$0.23 in the latest quarter. As a result, the market will likely focus on how these headline numbers relate to Pebblebrook’s path toward better margins over time.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-peb/pebblebrook-hotel-trust\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Pebblebrook Hotel Trust.</a> <p>With the latest figures on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the prevailing narratives around Pebblebrook’s growth prospects and margin recovery.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pccx5ap0-urban-hotels-and-ai-adoption-will-unlock-long-term-value-s0zu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Pebblebrook Hotel Trust</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-peb/pebblebrook-hotel-trust/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PEB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60cd98d7-f84a-4442-9a25-3163f918a00b/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PEB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>FFO swings and TTM losses still at US$105.7 million</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, Funds From Operations moved from US$13.5 million in Q1 to US$65.1 million in Q2, US$60.2 million in Q3 and then to a Q4 loss of US$138.8 million, while trailing twelve month net income was a loss of US$105.7 million on US$1.48b of revenue.</li> <li>Bulls point to property upgrades and technology as long term earnings drivers.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are looking at OceanFirst Financial and wondering whether its current share price lines up with its underlying worth, you are asking the exact question this article is built to tackle.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$19.04, with returns of 3.8% over the past 30 days, 6.7% year to date, and 12.8% over the past year. The 3 year and 5 year returns sit at a 5.6% decline and a 5.0% gain respectively.</li> <li>These share price moves sit against a backdrop of ongoing sector wide attention on US regional banks, with investors watching how balance sheets and funding profiles hold up compared to peers. Recent coverage has focused on how smaller banks are positioned within the broader financial sector. This helps frame how a bank like OceanFirst Financial might be assessed by the market.</li> <li>On our checks, OceanFirst Financial has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>.

It focuses on what the bank earns on its equity relative to its cost of equity.</p> <p>For OceanFirst Financial, the model uses a Book Value of US$28.97 per share and a Stable EPS of US$1.62 per share, based on the median return on equity from the past 5 years. The Average Return on Equity is 6.26%, compared with a Cost of Equity of US$2.18 per share. This setup leads to an Excess Return of US$0.56 per share and a Stable Book Value of US$25.85 per share, which is based on weighted future book value estimates from three analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$14.69 per share. Against the recent share price of US$19.04, this implies the stock is around 29.6% overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests OceanFirst Financial may be overvalued by 29.6%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for OceanFirst Financial.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: OceanFirst Financial Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable bank like OceanFirst Financial, the P/E ratio is a practical way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger earnings growth or see lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more muted or risks feel higher.</p> <p>OceanFirst Financial currently trades on a P/E of 16.28x. That sits above the Banks industry average P/E of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.76x, so the market is currently paying a higher price for its earnings than these broad reference points suggest.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might make sense for OceanFirst Financial specifically, given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is 26.69x, which is materially higher than the current 16.28x. On this view, the shares appear undervalued relative to what the model suggests could be a more company specific P/E level.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St these Narratives live on the Community page, where millions of investors can set a fair value and compare it with the current price to help frame buy or sell decisions. They can then see that view update automatically as new news or earnings come in. For OceanFirst Financial, one investor might build a Narrative around the higher US$22.75 price target with stronger revenue and margin assumptions, while another anchors on the US$18.50 target with more conservative expectations, and both can see in real time how their story, numbers and fair value stay aligned with the latest information.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OceanFirst Financial? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/OCFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The 1 day share price return is 7.14%, the 30 day share price return is 31.71%, and the 1 year total shareholder return is 146.59%. This points to sentiment that has been building over both the short and longer term.</p> <p>If this move in tanker stocks has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to see what else is moving in energy and infrastructure via our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a>.</p> <p>With the share price up sharply and Nordic American Tankers trading around a 16% discount to the US$6.25 analyst price target, the key question is whether there is still value on the table or if the market already reflects expectations for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred Price-to-Sales of 3.9x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nordic American Tankers last closed at $5.40, yet on a P/S basis the shares screen as expensive compared with both peers and an estimated fair level.</p> <p>The preferred multiple here is the price-to-sales ratio, which sits at 3.9x for Nordic American Tankers. For a tanker owner with $294.82m of revenue and earnings that include large one off items, this kind of sales multiple can reflect expectations that current conditions in shipping will support stronger profitability than recent reported margins suggest.</p> <p>Against peers, the gap is clear. The company trades at a 3.9x P/S ratio, while the US Oil and Gas industry average is 1.7x. In other words, the stock is priced at more than double that reference point.

The Supreme Court tariff ruling, and the prospect of refund relief, could modestly ease one of Goodyear’s biggest current pressures: elevated tariff and import costs. However, the key near term catalyst still rests on execution of cost reductions, while the main risk remains weak, volatile replacement and commercial tire demand.</p> <p>In that context, Goodyear’s recent Q4 2025 results are relevant: full year 2025 sales were US$18,280 million with a net loss of US$1,721 million, even as Q4 profitability improved. Any tariff refunds or lower net import costs could influence how much of future cash flow can be directed toward the Goodyear Forward restructuring program, manufacturing upgrades, and premium tire initiatives, which many investors see as central to the margin recovery story.</p> <p>Yet behind this potential relief, investors should be aware of how persistent tariff and import cost uncertainty could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (it's free!)</a></p><p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's narrative projects $18.3 billion revenue and $405.2 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's forecasts yield a $9.89 fair value</a>, a 17% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/69a7a862-2f07-48af-8a61-58d950ec00f0/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting revenue around US$19.4 billion and earnings near US$403 million by 2028, yet the recent tariff shake up could either reinforce their view of tariff driven localization benefits or highlight the contrasting risk that persistently high trade costs and supply chain friction might keep Goodyear’s margins far below those upbeat expectations.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber</a> - why the stock might be worth 10% less than the current price!</p><h2>Decide For Yourself</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

Even so, total shareholder return sits at 46.16% over one year and is very large over three years, suggesting momentum has cooled in the short term while longer term holders have still seen strong gains.</p> <p>If this quantum story has your attention, it might be a good moment to see what else is setting up in the space through our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_quantum\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 quantum computing stocks</a>.</p> <p>With QUBT trading at US$9.04 against an average analyst target of US$18.00, along with fresh cash and the Luminar deal in play, you have to ask whether this is a genuine mispricing or if the market is already factoring in substantial future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 61.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Quantum Computing last closing at $9.04 and the most followed narrative pointing to a fair value of $23.67, the gap between story and price is wide and worth understanding.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Acceleration of AI and data center workloads is driving urgent demand for energy efficient, high speed computing.

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates through 2027, including $60.7 million for 2026 and $39.9 million for 2027. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates free cash flow out to 2035, with projected figures such as $29.7 million in 2028 and around $19.7 million by 2035, all in dollars, and then discounts them back using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>Bringing all those discounted cash flows together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $10.06 per share under this DCF model. Compared with the latest share price of $59.18, this implies the stock is very expensive relative to this cash flow based estimate, with the model indicating it is 488.4% overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Benchmark Electronics may be overvalued by 488.4%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Benchmark Electronics.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Benchmark Electronics Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable business, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to see how much you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to what the company is currently earning, which is often the first anchor investors use when they look at valuation.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Benchmark Electronics is trading on a P/E of 85.0x, compared with an industry average of about 27.6x and a peer average of 63.8x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Benchmark Electronics is 42.3x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own profile rather than assuming all electronics companies deserve similar multiples. With the current P/E at 85.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 42.3x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out your story for Benchmark Electronics, link it to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and arrive at your own fair value. You can then easily compare this with the current price, view it alongside other Narratives on the Community page used by millions of investors, and watch it update automatically as new information like earnings or guidance comes in. One investor might build a Narrative that aligns closely with the current model fair value of about US$59.33, while another could plug in more cautious or more optimistic assumptions and land on a very different fair value. This in turn guides how each of them thinks about whether the share price is high, low or roughly in line with their view.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Benchmark Electronics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/BHE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This can be more meaningful than looking at revenue or assets alone.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on what the market thinks about a company’s earnings growth and risk. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Geely currently trades on a P/E of 9.41x. That sits below the Auto industry average of 19.30x and also below the peer group average of 10.79x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Geely is 11.12x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable after considering factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk.

This points to a large valuation gap based on that framework.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>CSL Limited exhibits strong fundamental characteristics, underpinned by leadership in plasma therapies and influenza vaccines, a robust R&amp;D pipeline, and clear drivers for earnings growth, particularly the ongoing recovery of CSL Behring's gross margin. The integration of CSL Vifor adds diversification, although it faces near term competitive pressures.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how that fair value is built? The narrative leans heavily on earnings expansion, margin rebuild in plasma, and a long runway of cash flows that are anything but simple.</p> <p>According to Ramsee, the author of this narrative, the valuation work uses a discounted cash flow model with a 4.0% discount rate and a long forecast period, treating CSL as a company whose cash generation can be projected and then brought back to today in A$ terms. The gap between the A$263.33 fair value and A$146.76 last close is tied to assumptions about revenue growth, margin recovery and capital intensity across Behring, Seqirus and Vifor, rather than short term share price moves.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of A$263.33 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_user_generated_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this hinges on tariff assumptions and CSL hitting its margin goals, with tougher US trade rules or slower Behring recovery both potential spoilers for that thesis.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/pharmaceuticals-biotech/asx-csl/csl-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this CSL narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another Way To Look At It: Earnings Multiple Check</h2> <p>Ramsee’s work leans on discounted cash flows, but the current P/E of 35.8x tells a different story. It sits above the Global Biotechs average of 29.5x and above the 29.3x fair ratio the market could move towards, even though it is below a 60.8x peer average.

The latest wider-than-expected quarterly loss keeps the near term risk centered on cash burn and execution, while the main catalyst is still whether CleanSpark can convert its power footprint into signed, revenue-generating AI data center leases. This update reinforces that tension but does not fundamentally change it.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is management’s progress on securing AI data center leases tied to its Texas power footprint, highlighted again with this quarter’s results. This matters because it links existing mining infrastructure and power access to a potential new revenue stream in AI and HPC, directly related to the current investor focus.

The Starwood partnership directly supports that shift by tying future growth to large, power‑rich campuses that can serve both bitcoin and AI customers, which may become a key near term catalyst. At the same time, the biggest risk remains execution and capital intensity as MARA retools sites while still being exposed to bitcoin‑driven earnings swings.</p> <p>The Starwood agreement also interacts with MARA’s pending Q4 2025 results, where analysts were already watching for updates on diversification beyond mining. Against that backdrop, the recently announced US$850,000,000 convertible notes offering is especially relevant, since it highlights how much funding this transition could require and why dilution and leverage are important short term watchpoints alongside the promise of AI‑aligned data centers.</p> <p>But while the upside story is clear, investors should also be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-mara/mara-holdings/rieem6ia-mara-expanding-industry-leadership-will-drive-long-term-sector-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MARA Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>MARA Holdings' narrative projects $1.1 billion revenue and $31.5 million earnings by 2028.

Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.</a></p> <p>The lawsuits around ENTRA1 hit the core of how NuScale plans to turn its Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved small modular reactor design into actual projects. Plaintiffs claim NuScale entrusted commercialization and large capital commitments to a partner with no meaningful nuclear track record, while paying ENTRA1 about US$495 million tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority agreement. That sits next to a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million on sales of US$31.48 million and a new US$1b at the market equity offering filing, so legal uncertainty is landing at the same time as heavy cash usage and potential dilution. The recent Romanian approval shows the technology is still finding willing counterparties, but Fluor’s intention to exit and multiple law firms pursuing securities cases add questions around governance and disclosure. For you as an investor, the key issue is whether project partners, regulators and capital providers remain comfortable backing NuScale while these claims work through the courts, which can take years and could involve settlements, higher costs or tighter oversight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The NuScale Power Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The Romanian SMR project approval aligns with the narrative that NuScale’s NRC certified design and partnerships can eventually support commercial deployment and potential future revenue from projects like RoPower.</li> <li>The ENTRA1 focused lawsuits directly challenge the narrative’s reliance on that partner to drive commercialization and funding, and highlight that this dependency could be a key execution weak point.</li> <li>The size and structure of the ENTRA1 payments, along with the follow on US$1b equity filing, may not be fully captured in earlier narrative assumptions about funding sources and cash runway.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/64bqs928-smr-landmark-us-nuclear-agreement-will-shape-commercialization-path-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NuScale Power</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Multiple securities class actions focused on ENTRA1 disclosures could lead to legal costs, management distraction and potential settlements.</li> <li>⚠️ A US$1b follow on equity program, very large ENTRA1 related expenses and Fluor’s planned exit all point to dilution and funding risk that analysts have already flagged.</li> <li>🎁 NuScale holds NRC design approval in an SMR field that includes peers such as TerraPower and GE Hitachi, which supports its position when pitching long term baseload power to utilities and data center customers.</li> <li>🎁 The Romanian SMR investment decision and work with the Tennessee Valley Authority show that there is institutional interest in NuScale’s technology for future nuclear capacity.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, any updates on the ENTRA1 related lawsuits, including motions to dismiss, settlements or regulatory follow up, because these will shape potential financial and disclosure consequences. Second, NuScale’s cash burn, use of the US$1b equity program and any changes in project timing in future results, as the company reported a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million. Third, progress on concrete delivery milestones at the Romanian plant and with the TVA partnership compared with other SMR efforts from players such as Rolls Royce and GE Hitachi. Together, those signals will indicate whether NuScale can keep moving from engineering work to funded projects while managing legal and financing pressures.</p> <p>To stay up to date on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NuScale Power, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/SMR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for NuScale Power</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The implied long run dividend growth rate is capped at 1.73%, even though the underlying input growth estimate is 3.39%. That cap is intended to keep the assumptions conservative and aligned with what may be sustainable over time.</p> <p>Using these inputs, the DDM outputs an intrinsic value of roughly €18.45 per share.

It helps you see how many euros the market is willing to pay for each euro of annual profit.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company's growth outlook and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to line up with a lower P/E.</p> <p>E.ON is currently trading on a P/E of 17.21x. That is below the Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.20x but above the peer group average of 16.26x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for E.ON is 7.16x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable given factors like the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio directly incorporates those company specific drivers, it offers a more tailored yardstick than simple peer or industry comparisons. The current P/E of 17.21x is well above the Fair Ratio of 7.16x, which indicates that the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about E.ON, linked directly to a forecast for its revenue, earnings and margins, and then to your own view of fair value. All of this is captured in an easy tool on Simply Wall St's Community page that compares your fair value to the live share price, updates automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive, and lets different investors express very different views. For example, one Narrative might lean toward the higher analyst fair value of about €18.30 with stronger long term assumptions, while another might sit closer to the lower analyst price target of €14.00 with more cautious expectations. This gives you a clear, numbers based way to decide whether the current price near €19.77 lines up with the story you believe.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for E.ON? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/EOAN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Constellation Software and its subsidiary Topicus.com recently reported that Topicus.com’s fourth-quarter 2025 revenue rose 20% year over year, with 4% organic growth and the remainder driven by acquisitions, alongside a 41% increase in quarterly net income but a lower full-year net income due to an accounting expense tied to its investment in Asseco Poland S.A.</li> <li>These results underline how Topicus.com’s acquisition-led expansion and sizeable investment in Asseco Poland S.A. are becoming increasingly important to Constellation Software’s overall business profile.</li> <li>We’ll now explore how Topicus.com’s acquisition-fueled growth and earnings performance may influence Constellation Software’s investment narrative for shareholders.</li> </ul><p>Outshine the giants: these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434414/ai-penny-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement</a>.</p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>What Is Constellation Software's Investment Narrative?</h2><p>To own Constellation Software, you really have to believe in its ability to keep buying and improving vertical market software businesses, then compound the cash they throw off with disciplined capital allocation. The latest Topicus.com update, with acquisition-driven revenue growth and a jump in quarterly earnings but a hit to full-year profit from the Asseco Poland S.A. accounting charge, reinforces that Constellation’s story is increasingly tied to complex deal-making rather than smooth headline numbers. In the short term, that likely sharpens the focus on the upcoming Q4 2025 results as a catalyst, particularly around how management explains one-off items and the returns they expect from large equity stakes. It also nudges the risk profile a bit higher around balance sheet flexibility, integration execution and earnings volatility, even if the market reaction so far suggests no dramatic change to the core thesis.</p> However, one key balance sheet risk linked to acquisition intensity is easy to overlook and investors should be aware of it.\n\nConstellation Software's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c7251dc1-43e4-4b4d-943d-ec40ff5f4adc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Nineteen Simply Wall St Community members see fair value anywhere between about CA$3,333 and CA$7,927, underscoring how far apart individual views can be.
