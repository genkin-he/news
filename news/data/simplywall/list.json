            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Silvercrest Asset Management Group (SAMG) delivered a mixed set of numbers this period, with earnings forecast to grow at an impressive 31.1% per year, well ahead of the US market’s projected 15.9%. However, revenue growth is expected to trail broader market trends at 6.6% per year, and net profit margins have slipped slightly to 6.6% from 7.1% last year. While the stock trades at $14.14, below its assessed fair value of $16.10 and boasts a low price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1x, investors will note that earnings have declined at a 7.3% annual rate over the last five years and have shown negative growth in the past year. The result is a picture of strong forward profit potential and value, tempered by caution over recent operational and payout trends.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-samg/silvercrest-asset-management-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Silvercrest Asset Management Group.</a> <p>We’ll now see how these results line up with the most widely followed narratives about Silvercrest, whether they confirm market confidence or raise new questions for investors.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rp3u68ea-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-and-global-expansion-will-unlock-future-value-u42w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Silvercrest Asset Management Group</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-samg/silvercrest-asset-management-group/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:SAMG Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/47e1d595-da08-470b-8454-a3a6f03bc7ac/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:SAMG Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Fee Compression Limits Revenue Upside</h2> <ul> <li>The most recent quarter saw a decline in year-over-year revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in average annual management fee rate as the asset mix shifted toward lower-fee institutional mandates.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view expects that, while wealthy client and generational wealth trends should boost organic asset inflows, persistent fee compression will threaten margin expansion and slow top-line growth.\n    <ul> <li>Outflows and a shift toward institutional mandates with lower fees are already weighing on the average fee rate, challenging the view that client growth alone will deliver sustainable revenue gains.</li> <li>Consensus notes that diversified offerings and premium advisory services could help offset these headwinds. However, overall margin pressure remains a watchpoint for the next few years.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consistent with this balanced risk and reward picture, analysts anticipate profit margins could eventually recover from 6.6% today to 16.6% in three years, but only if these strategic investments pay off as planned.\n    <ul> <li>With operating leverage yet to materialize, near-term profitability is vulnerable to any setbacks in client growth or continued fee erosion.</li> <li>Expectations for a rebound hinge on the successful execution of expansion and a return to stronger net inflows amid industrywide margin compression.</li> </ul> </li> <li>A 7.3% annual decline in earnings over the past five years, alongside recently negative earnings growth, underscores why consensus is closely watching for signs of a turning point.\n    <ul> <li>This trend calls into question the pace at which new market initiatives and premium service expansion will start translating into bottom-line growth.</li> <li>Consensus sees the recovery path as dependent on both stemming the decline and demonstrating that earnings can actually outpace the industry going forward.</li> </ul> See what could change the story with the full consensus narrative: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rp3u68ea-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-and-global-expansion-will-unlock-future-value-u42w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Silvercrest Asset Management Group Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividends and Share Buybacks Under Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 7.0% annually over the next three years due to active share repurchase programs, aiming to boost earnings per share even as traditional growth levers face challenges.</li> <li>Consensus narrative emphasizes that while aggressive share buybacks and a rising dividend deliver immediate value to shareholders, there is an ongoing risk to dividend sustainability, especially with earnings under pressure and net profit margins having slipped from 7.1% to 6.6%.\n    <ul> <li>Shareholder returns are attractive today, but persistent earnings declines and rising costs could force a re-evaluation of payout ratios if margins do not recover as forecast.</li> <li>With compensation and G&amp;A expenses rising faster than revenue, dividends and buybacks rely on management’s ability to deliver on operating leverage and margin improvement targets despite industry headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Still Offers a Margin of Safety</h2> <ul> <li>Silvercrest trades at $14.14, below both the analyst consensus price target of $23.00 and the DCF fair value of $16.10, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1x that is substantially lower than the US capital markets industry average of 25.6x and the peer average of 63.3x.</li> <li>According to the consensus narrative, this discount provides some cushion for investors who believe in the turnaround. It goes hand-in-hand with skepticism over the company’s ability to reverse its multi-year earnings slide.\n    <ul> <li>If management delivers on revenue, margin, and buyback targets, the current price leaves meaningful room for upside relative to both intrinsic and peer-based valuation measures.</li> <li>Conversely, investors face the risk that earnings struggles and industry-wide pressure may keep the stock from closing the gap with valuations typical of higher-growth, higher-margin peers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rp3u68ea-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-and-global-expansion-will-unlock-future-value-u42w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Silvercrest Asset Management Group on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Spot an angle the data might not show?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Financial Partners GroupLtd (TSE:7148) has posted a stellar 40.8% annual earnings growth over the past five years, with net profit margins now at 14%, down from last year's 19%. Revenue is forecast to increase by 17% per year, sharply ahead of the broader Japanese market’s 4.5% projection. Analysts anticipate annual EPS growth of 25.8% moving forward. With a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 9.9x, lower than both the industry average of 12.3x and peers at 11.6x, the stock trades at a discount even as earnings momentum looks set to continue.

This indicates that, despite top-line growth, costs are eating into profits.</li> <li>Notably, even with this slip in margins, analysts see upside potential from strong revenue forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Revenue is expected to grow by 17% per year, which is well above the market’s 4.5%. Analysts believe that scaling up could help support future profitability despite current headwinds.</li> <li>However, narrowing margins raise fresh questions about operational efficiency and whether anticipated earnings growth of 25.8% annually will flow through as strongly as bulls hope.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Strength Faces Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Dividend sustainability was flagged as a risk. While headline growth is impressive, investors should be alert to signs that payouts may not keep pace with financial performance.</li> <li>Critics highlight that, although the company’s fundamentals are robust on paper:\n    <ul> <li>Warnings around unsound dividend coverage could become more pressing if margin compression continues, especially since net profit margin dropped by 5 percentage points year-over-year.</li> <li>The overall financial position, while not dire, calls for careful monitoring if investors are banking on high and stable dividends as part of the total return.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Discount to Peers and DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The 9.9x Price-to-Earnings ratio is a marked discount to the industry average of 12.3x and to peers at 11.6x. The current 2,140 JPY share price sits well below the DCF fair value estimate of 3,446.40 JPY, suggesting substantial upside if expectations hold true.</li> <li>This gap heavily supports the case that the stock offers relative value:\n    <ul> <li>Despite margin and earnings volatility, projected revenue and EPS growth rates outpace the broader market, which could justify re-rating closer to peer multiples over time.</li> <li>Still, investors must weigh whether the current discount is due to transitory issues, such as margin compression, or is a more persistent sign of underlying risk, especially in light of flagged concerns over financial strength and payout sustainability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>To see how these themes connect to shifting market sentiment and community expectations, check the latest consensus on where Financial Partners GroupLtd might be headed. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_consensus_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Financial Partners GroupLtd Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if SkyWest’s share price reflects its true value, or if there’s something the market might be missing? You’re definitely not alone. There is a lot to explore when it comes to what this stock is really worth.</li> <li>Recently, SkyWest’s stock has been relatively stable, with a slight 0.1% gain over the last week but down just 0.6% year-to-date. This follows its significant 472.9% rise over the past three years.</li> <li>Market chatter has picked up amid sector-wide optimism and renewed confidence in regional carriers, partly thanks to expanding travel demand and evolving partnerships within the industry. This context helps explain why SkyWest’s price might be shifting now, even though there have not been major headlines recently.</li> <li>On our valuation scorecard, SkyWest currently stands at <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> for undervaluation checks, making it a standout among its peers.

This approach gives investors a clearer sense of intrinsic value based on the money the business is expected to generate.</p> <p>For SkyWest, the model starts with its latest annual Free Cash Flow of $312.5 million. Analyst projections see this growing steadily, reaching $526 million by 2027. Simply Wall St then extrapolates those analyst figures over a total of ten years, foreseeing Free Cash Flow potentially moving above $1 billion by 2035. All these numbers are calculated in USD and reflect both forecasted results by analysts and further estimates using observed trends.</p> <p>Pulled together and discounted to today’s value, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $257.27 per share. This is a striking 60.9% higher than the current share price, indicating that SkyWest stock may be significantly undervalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests SkyWest is undervalued by 60.9%. Track this in your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>, or discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">834 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows</a>.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SKYW Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a91a2f28-b555-432a-bc36-4bc56bc1779f/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SKYW Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for SkyWest.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: SkyWest Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often the preferred metric for valuing profitable companies like SkyWest, as it directly links a company's share price to its bottom-line earnings. This makes it easy to gauge what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of profit. A higher PE can reflect expectations for robust future growth, while a lower PE might indicate more risk or less confidence in those prospects.</p> <p>Currently, SkyWest trades at a PE ratio of 9.95x. This is just above the industry average for airlines, which stands at 8.75x, and significantly below the peer group average of 23.98x. These comparisons suggest that SkyWest may not be getting the same growth premium as top competitors, even though it remains comfortably profitable.</p> <p>To provide a more tailored benchmark, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for SkyWest. In this case, it is 10.92x. Unlike standard industry or peer averages, the Fair Ratio adjusts for unique factors such as SkyWest’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, size, industry dynamics, and risk profile. This offers a more accurate reflection of what SkyWest's multiple should be in today’s market, giving investors a comprehensive perspective.</p> <p>SkyWest’s actual PE ratio of 9.95x is very close to its Fair Ratio of 10.92x, suggesting the stock is trading at about the level its fundamentals warrant.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-skyw/skywest/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:SKYW PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a91a2f28-b555-432a-bc36-4bc56bc1779f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:SKYW PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your SkyWest Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your own story behind a company's numbers, connecting your personal perspective on future revenue, earnings, and margins with an assumed fair value. Instead of relying only on static metrics, Narratives bring together the company’s business story, your expectations, and financial forecasts into one easy-to-use tool, available on Simply Wall St’s Community page and trusted by millions of investors.</p> <p>Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by comparing your own Fair Value to today’s market price.

Looking forward, earnings are forecast to rise 19.6% per year, outpacing the broader US market's expected growth rate of 15.9%. However, revenue growth is projected at a slower 4.2% per year compared to the 10.3% US market average.

This supports cash flow stability and reduces churn risk, even as the company faces top-line pressures.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that the accelerating adoption of generative AI research tools and deeper coverage of digital transformation topics are giving Forrester increased leverage with clients. This has led to improved subscription growth and pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that innovative frameworks like the Total Experience Score have enabled longer contracts and stronger client retention.</li> <li>At the same time, new government contract wins and a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in the sales pipeline point to revenue diversification and potential future stability, despite near-term declines.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Deep Relative Discount Signals Value Disconnect</h2> <ul> <li>Forrester trades at a 0.3x price-to-sales ratio. This is well below the US professional services industry average of 1.3x and the peer average of 5.4x, suggesting the market reflects pessimism about future prospects.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view underscores that while Forrester's DCF fair value is estimated at $14.55 and the analyst price target sits at $12.00, the current share price is just $7.13. This indicates a wide perceived discount. Consensus expects profitability and stability to improve if retention efforts and operational shifts are successful.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap is especially notable given the sector’s 10.3% annual growth benchmark, compared to Forrester’s much lower 0.6% forecasted pace.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests investors must consider whether deep discounts sufficiently compensate for slower growth, given analyst hopes for a turnaround in client engagement and margins.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Operational Pressures Continue to Weigh</h2> <ul> <li>Operating expenses have declined by 6%, primarily due to a 12% reduction in headcount, as Forrester seeks to control losses and protect margins during ongoing sales and client retention challenges.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view draws attention to sustained revenue declines across research, consulting, and events, including an 8% overall revenue drop year-over-year. This highlights substantial pressures on topline stability and raises important questions about the speed of potential recovery.\n    <ul> <li>Critics note that wallet retention and contract value have also slipped, down 1% and 7%, respectively, signaling ongoing client budget tightening driven by macroeconomic factors.</li> <li>Consensus narrative also notes that while the company's cost management efforts have supported margins, these measures could constrain capacity for innovation and limit long-term upside if trends do not reverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The recent progress update showing 63% completion and on-budget construction is a big step, as it keeps key short-term catalysts, like first gold production in January 2026 and successful plant commissioning, firmly in play. This milestone reduces uncertainty around delays and cost overruns, which had been front-of-mind risks. However, significant insider selling and a price-to-book ratio well above sector averages leave open questions about valuation and management confidence. While the strong pace of progress likely tempers some immediate risks, funding, gold price sensitivity and execution remain central issues worth tracking as Fenix moves closer to production.</p> Yet, the pace of insider selling raises questions investors should not overlook.\n\nRio2's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d60db42f-7272-451b-a708-599b0564ba25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Nine members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate Rio2's fair value from US$1,000 to US$10,000.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Capital Power (TSX:CPX) has posted eye-catching headline numbers, with earnings rising at an average annual rate of 33.9% over the past five years, despite a slip into negative earnings growth in the most recent period. Net profit margin dropped to 11.7% from last year’s 13.7%, and the bottom line was boosted by a one-off CA$290.0 million gain. Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow at 4.1% per year, trailing the Canadian market’s 5%, while earnings are expected to accelerate by 21.3% per year, pacing well ahead of the sector. Investors are weighing this strong growth outlook against a premium 27x P/E ratio as well as notable risks around financial quality, share dilution, and dividend sustainability.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Capital Power.</a> <p>Next up, we’ll see how the headline figures fit alongside the current narratives.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing. Expectations are high, and any disappointment on growth or margins could weigh on the shares.</li> <li>Investors may want to examine whether guided earnings growth and margin forecasts are truly achievable in light of competitive and market risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how the broader consensus narrative stacks up against these latest financial figures, check out the full story in the analyst consensus breakdown. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Capital Power Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Capital Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Do these figures tell a different story to you?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Watts Water Technologies (WTS) shares have pulled back about 2% over the past month, even as the company’s returns this year remain strong. Investors may be weighing recent performance alongside steady growth in annual revenue and net income.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-wts/watts-water-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Watts Water Technologies.</a></p> <p>Watts Water Technologies has climbed steadily in 2024, with a 36% year-to-date share price return and a robust 44% total shareholder return over the past year. This highlights real long-term momentum. While shares have eased slightly in recent weeks, investors seem to be recalibrating after substantial multi-year gains and strong financial growth.</p> <p>If you’re curious where similar momentum might be building, now is the perfect moment to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Watts shares hovering near their recent highs and growth metrics remaining healthy, the key question now is whether the current price reflects all that future momentum or if investors still have a buying opportunity.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued</h2> <p>Watts Water Technologies’ most followed narrative points to a fair value of $277.80, almost identical to the recent closing price of $273.07, highlighting a market consensus that the stock is currently priced about right. This sets the stage for a closer look at what’s driving analyst conviction about Watts’ future earnings and market opportunity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The accelerating rollout and success of Nexa, Watts' intelligent water management platform, positions the company to capture the growing demand for advanced, data-driven water conservation, efficiency, and regulatory compliance solutions. This is expected to drive higher-margin, recurring revenue and support long-term earnings and margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/o1j3uth9-water-infrastructure-upgrades-will-fuel-demand-in-urban-markets-l9xl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what assumptions drive this razor-thin fair value margin? The narrative’s ultra-optimistic earnings outlook hinges on digital innovation, margin expansion, and aggressive growth forecasts. But what’s the catch behind these aggressive numbers?

Watts trades at 29.2x earnings, noticeably higher than both the industry average of 24.6x and the peer average of 28.7x. The fair ratio, which could be the level the market moves toward, is just 21.1x. This premium signals the market expects outsized growth or rewards quality.

Revenue is forecast to decline by 4.7% per year over the next three years, while EPS is expected to grow at a rate of 5.53% annually.

This perspective is underlined by concerns over rising capital requirements and the pace of Equinor’s renewables expansion.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that while Equinor’s low multiple offers immediate value, it may also reflect caution about the sustainability of high dividends as legacy oil and gas fields mature.</li> <li>The consensus also points out that persistent optimism assumes offshore wind and renewables will offset margin pressures. Recent U.S. offshore wind impairments highlight the difficulty of rapidly replacing oil cash flows with profitable renewable income.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>What is striking is how this valuation mismatch shapes market expectations for fair pricing and future returns.

Ongoing profit growth and new long-term gas contracts could add upside.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus highlights that the fair value premium is only meaningful if projected margin improvements and cash flows from new projects materialize amid regulatory and price risks.</li> <li>This wide discount, combined with moderate analyst price targets near current levels, shows how the market is balancing potential upside with caution about decarbonization and energy transition headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Equinor on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different interpretation of the data?

Net profit margins surged to 44.3% this year, up from 31.4% last year. However, this jump was influenced by a $568.3 million one-off gain, which plays a key role in the comparison.

While limited new apartment supply and strong demand trends help stabilize revenue, Essex’s heavy reliance on California and Seattle assets means growth will remain exposed to local regulation and potential economic downturns.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts note ongoing demographic support for occupancy and rents; however, recent slow rent growth in Southern California—which accounts for 40% of Essex’s portfolio—signals risks to sustained profitability.</li> <li>It is notable that, despite the current high margin, analysts anticipate further pressure as Essex phases out higher-yielding investments and encounters more competition along with stricter regulation in its key urban markets.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To see how analysts weigh both upside and risk as margins adjust, check the balanced narrative in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Essex Property Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Trails Broader Market</h2> <ul> <li>Revenue is projected to grow at just 2.9% annually over the next three years, well below the expected 10.3% per year for the US market. Earnings are forecast to decline by -22.4% per year during the same period.</li> <li>The consensus narrative underscores that, although Essex’s strategy favors capital allocation to stabilized, high-occupancy apartments in tech-centric areas, the lack of diversification continues to be a risk—recent underperformance in key geographies demonstrates this vulnerability.\n    <ul> <li>Some analysts argue that ongoing softness in Los Angeles and increased exposure to local supply and demand cycles will limit potential growth, particularly as Essex shifts away from higher-margin structured finance and refocuses on core real estate assets.</li> <li>From a consensus perspective, compressed cap rates and strong competition for acquisitions in Northern California, where yields are in the low-to-mid 4% range, could constrain future returns relative to more diversified REIT peers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Remains Supportive Despite Softer Projections</h2> <ul> <li>Essex’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 19x is notably below the peer average of 50.8x and the North American Residential REITs industry average of 24.4x. The current share price of $249.82 is about 28% below the DCF fair value estimate of $347.22.</li> <li>The analysts’ consensus narrative acknowledges that while earnings are expected to decline and future profit margins are set to compress, valuation metrics and a current price about 16% below their $291.11 price target provide support for a positive longer-term case for income and value-focused investors.\n    <ul> <li>The ongoing discount to fair value offers a cushion for investors focused on yield and capital protection, while also recognizing potential regulatory and economic volatility.</li> <li>Consensus further highlights that income-oriented investors remain attracted to Essex’s dividend and track record, despite concerns about near-term earnings declines and compressed margins compared to industry averages.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Essex Property Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you interpret the data another way?

This creates a runway for double-digit sales increases in fast growth end markets and supports sustained above-GDP revenue growth. Ongoing digital transformation in industrial sectors and the proliferation of IoT applications are expanding the need for custom sensors and embedded technologies. Standex's ramped-up R&amp;D and layered new product launches are expected to compound organic growth and provide higher-margin revenue streams, underpinning multi-year operating and net margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/z9jhyfdh-automation-and-electrification-will-strengthen-future-market-resilience-24bh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want the full story behind this hefty premium?

Despite solid historical profitability and high-quality earnings, forward-looking growth rates and recent compression in net margins, paired with a premium valuation, give investors plenty to consider this earnings season.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Kirby.</a> <p>The next section puts Kirby's results head-to-head with the popular market narratives to reveal where expectations line up and where investor assumptions might face new challenges.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Kirby</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/35154fdf-b7c7-4a38-b012-29fc4c0387af/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Analyst Price Target Offers 15.6% Upside to Current Price</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby's share price sits at $104.33, notably below the analyst price target of $120.60, representing potential upside of about 15.6% from current levels if analyst forecasts play out.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that for shares to reach the $120.60 target, Kirby must achieve projected revenue growth averaging 6.1% per year and expand profit margins from 9.3% to 11.4% by 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This scenario assumes earnings climb to $445.6 million over the next four years, matching analysts' expectations for consistent multi-year growth and market share gains.</li> <li>To justify the price target, Kirby would need to trade at a forward PE of 16.5x in 2028, which is nearly double the industry average of 8.4x. This suggests ongoing investor confidence in its premium positioning and strategic tailwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Consensus narrative says Kirby’s numbers have to keep stacking up.

Even if Kirby meets earnings targets, its shares need to hold above today’s sector-wide valuation to fulfill upward price expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Industry Tailwinds vs. Market Growth Rates</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby’s revenue is forecast to grow at 4.8% per year, which lags significantly behind the broader US market’s expected 10.3% annual revenue growth. This is a sign its end-markets remain solid but are not keeping pace with wider economic sectors.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that limited vessel supply, data center investment, and U.S. manufacturing reshoring may help Kirby maintain steady utilization and revenue visibility despite softer chemical demand.\n    <ul> <li>Offsetting these strengths, the consensus view cautions that Kirby’s dependence on the petrochemical market, ongoing cost pressures, and limited international diversification could constrain top-line expansion and earnings stability if the US economic cycle weakens.</li> <li>This tension means that even with powerful industry trends at its back, Kirby’s outlook is inevitably tied to the health of cyclical chemical demand and capital expenditures by US industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Kirby on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you have a unique perspective on Kirby’s results?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.  That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least.     </p><p> After losing 3.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.
