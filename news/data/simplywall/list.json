            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

This Shell agreement showcases Halliburton’s edge in delivering operational efficiency and safety, supporting near-term differentiation for its service portfolio, but it does not meaningfully offset the prevailing risks around slower oil demand and regulatory headwinds.\n</p> <p> Among recent developments, Halliburton’s multi-year contracts with Petrobras to deploy advanced production optimization technologies in Brazil stand out. Such wins build on its global presence and technology leadership, tying directly to the catalysts surrounding international expansion and the company’s ability to maintain earnings resilience outside North America.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that, in contrast, persistent regulatory pressures and decarbonization efforts could erode oilfield service demand and...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-hal/halliburton/m6v3al5o-power-generation-and-data-center-exposure-will-shape-future-risk-and-reward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Halliburton (it's free!)</a></p><p>Halliburton's outlook anticipates $22.1 billion in revenue and $2.0 billion in earnings by 2028.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.  While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> collection of companies boasting high return on equity</a>, or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> this list of stocks with significant insider holdings</a> to be useful.  </p></div>",

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.  A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>).

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

Over the last year, the company’s profitability has not improved, and investors should note there is no concrete evidence of high-quality past earnings in the current results.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company’s inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine’s filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company’s current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company’s discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ₩32t ÷ (₩129t - ₩25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this modest revenue performance will accelerate.  However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.     </p> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/software/ams-mtrk/motork-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on MotorK </a>will help you uncover what's on the horizon.  <h2> How Is MotorK's Revenue Growth Trending?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the industry for P/S ratios like MotorK's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 11%.   Revenue has also lifted 28% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth.  Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been respectable for the company.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 104% during the coming year according to the sole analyst following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this information, we can see why MotorK is trading at such a high P/S compared to the industry.  Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What Does MotorK's P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> Our look into MotorK shows that its P/S ratio remains high on the merit of its strong future revenues.  It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S.  Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.     </p><p> You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/software/ams-mtrk/motork-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 2 warning signs for MotorK</strong> </a> you should be aware of.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of MotorK's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. </p><p> We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws.  If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><h2> Crunching The Numbers </h2> <p> We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase.  In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years.   Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.  </p><p> A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today,  so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: </p><h4> 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate </h4><table><tr><td> </td><td><strong>2026</strong></td><td><strong>2027</strong></td><td><strong>2028</strong></td><td><strong>2029</strong></td><td><strong>2030</strong></td><td><strong>2031</strong></td><td><strong>2032</strong></td><td><strong>2033</strong></td><td><strong>2034</strong></td><td><strong>2035</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong> Levered FCF (SEK, Millions) </strong></td><td>kr931.5m</td><td>kr1.31b</td><td>kr1.29b</td><td>kr1.58b</td><td>kr1.75b</td><td>kr1.89b</td><td>kr2.01b</td><td>kr2.10b</td><td>kr2.18b</td><td>kr2.25b</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Growth Rate Estimate Source</strong></td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Est @ 10.91%</td><td>Est @ 8.10%</td><td>Est @ 6.14%</td><td>Est @ 4.76%</td><td>Est @ 3.80%</td><td>Est @ 3.12%</td></tr><tr><td><strong> Present Value (SEK, Millions) Discounted @ 5.8% </strong></td><td>kr880</td><td>kr1.2k</td><td>kr1.1k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td></tr></table><p><i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = kr12b</p><p> After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.  The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.8%. </p><p><strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2035</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = kr2.2b× (1 + 1.6%) ÷ (5.8%– 1.6%) = kr53b</p><p><strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= kr53b÷ ( 1 + 5.8%)<sup>10</sup>= kr30b</p><p> The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows,  which in this case is kr42b.  In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.  Compared to the current share price of kr84.1, the company appears   a touch undervalued    at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently.   Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"dcf\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"760\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/247592118-dcf-1-dark-2/1761885552260\" width=\"1706\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:ASKER Discounted Cash Flow October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2> The Assumptions </h2><p> We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows.  You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.  The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.  Given that we are looking at Asker Healthcare Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.  In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Asker Healthcare Group </a></span></p><h3>SWOT Analysis for Asker Healthcare Group</h3><div class=\"sc-8e1a88f-5 dSGGTD\"><div class=\"block strength\"><strong>Strength</strong> <ul><li>Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.</li></ul> <ul><li>Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.</li></ul> <ul><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Balance sheet summary for ASKER.</a></ul> </div><div class=\"block weakness\"><strong>Weakness</strong> <ul><li> No major weaknesses identified for ASKER.</li></ul></div><div class=\"block opportunity\"><strong>Opportunity</strong> <ul><li>Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swedish market.</li></ul> <ul><li>Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.</li></ul> </div><div class=\"block threat\"><strong>Threat</strong> <ul><li>Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.</li></ul> <ul> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What else are analysts forecasting for ASKER?</a></ul> </div></div><h2> Moving On: </h2><p> Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it  ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.  The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool.  Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.  For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.   Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Before this announcement, Meko was paying out 83% of earnings, but a comparatively small 46% of free cash flows.  This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.   </p><p> EPS is set to fall by 1.8% over the next 12 months if recent trends continue.  However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 77%, meaning that most of the company's earnings is being paid out to shareholders.    </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/5686693-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761885570964\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:MEKO Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Meko </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years.      Since 2015, the annual payment back then was SEK7.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of SEK3.90.      Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 5.7% per year.    Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.   </p> <h2>The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited</h2> <p> Given that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon.      Meko hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.   </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Meko's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment.       In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it.      We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.  </p><p> It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.  However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> This week we saw the <strong>Bactiguard Holding AB (publ)</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STO:BACTI B</a>) share price climb by 20%.    But will that heal all the wounds inflicted over 5 years of declines? Unlikely.  In fact, the share price has tumbled down a mountain to land 88% lower after that period.  So we don't gain too much confidence from the recent recovery.  The important question is if the business itself justifies a higher share price in the long term.       While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.  </p><p> While the stock has risen 20% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> Bactiguard Holding wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option.  Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip.  That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.  </p><p> Over five years, Bactiguard Holding grew its revenue at 6.2% per year.   That's a pretty good rate for a long time period.   So it is unexpected to see the stock down 13% per year in the last five years.  The truth is that the growth might be below expectations, and investors are probably worried about the continual losses.      </p><p> The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/241402768-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761885601396\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BACTI B Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> If you are thinking of buying or selling Bactiguard Holding stock, you should check out this <strong>FREE</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">detailed report on its balance sheet</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Bactiguard Holding shareholders are down 56% for the year, but the market itself is up 7.9%.  However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 13% over the last half decade.  We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Bactiguard Holding better, we need to consider many other factors.   Even so, be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Bactiguard Holding is showing <strong> 1 warning sign in our investment analysis</strong> </a>, you should know about...    </p><p> We will like Bactiguard Holding better if we see some big insider buys.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr20.85 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.  In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important.   As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.     </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr5.6m for 254.99k shares.  But they sold 128.00k shares for kr3.2m.     Overall, ITAB Shop Concept insiders were net buyers during the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.   Insiders own 12% of ITAB Shop Concept shares, worth about kr634m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The ITAB Shop Concept Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.    However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, ITAB Shop Concept insiders feel good about the company's future.
