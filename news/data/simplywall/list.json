On a trailing 12 month basis, EPS was US$2.15 on revenue of about US$1.0 billion and net income of US$128.2 million, setting up a story where investors are weighing earnings growth forecasts against a thinner profit margin profile.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-cwt/california-water-service-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for California Water Service Group.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings print lines up with the widely followed narratives around CWT’s growth potential, risk profile, and long term profitability story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/9t2mqp2i-capital-investment-in-water-infrastructure-will-expand-regulated-base-t1di\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about California Water Service Group</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-cwt/california-water-service-group/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CWT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/64bc4bd4-6a65-4a95-8172-d50dd779dee2/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CWT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 12.8%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, CWT earned US$128.2 million of net income on about US$1.0b of revenue.

The drop from 18.4% to 12.8% shows how higher compliance and treatment costs can tighten margins in the meantime.</li> <li>With trailing 12 month net income at US$128.2 million versus US$190.8 million a year earlier, the story now hinges on whether future rate cases and cost recoveries can line up more closely with this higher investment and operating spend.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue these margin pressures are temporary and tied to the timing of rate relief and PFAS recovery, not the earning power of the system over a full cycle. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 California Water Service Group Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E Sits Between Industry Benchmarks</h2> <ul> <li>CWT currently trades on a 20.7x P/E, above the Global Water Utilities average of 16.8x but below the closer Water Utilities peer average of 24.8x.</li> <li>Bears focus on this mid range P/E together with weaker coverage ratios, arguing that paying more than the global sector average looks demanding while interest and dividends are not well covered.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus data indicates that interest payments are not well covered by earnings and that the 3.01% dividend yield is not well covered by free cash flow, which makes a 20.7x multiple look less comfortable for cautious investors.</li> <li>At the same time, five year earnings growth of 9.1% per year and forecast growth of about 9.6% per year show why some investors still accept a P/E above the global average, even with these balance sheet pressures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics highlight that paying 20.7x earnings while interest and dividend coverage stay tight could leave less room for error if growth or regulation disappoint. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 California Water Service Group Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>DCF Fair Value Trails Share Price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of US$39.61 sits below the current share price of US$44.59, while the consensus analyst target of US$52.00 is above where the stock trades today.</li> <li>What stands out in the consensus narrative is the gap between these valuation markers and the operational backdrop, where forecast earnings growth of about 9.6% per year and revenue growth of roughly 5.3% per year are being weighed against regulatory and PFAS related cost risks.\n    <ul> <li>The analyst target of US$52.00 assumes earnings rising from about US$135.8 million today to US$187.9 million by around 2028, so any delay in rate cases or higher than expected PFAS capex would matter a lot for whether that path is achieved.</li> <li>At the same time, forecasts for revenue to reach around US$1.1b by 2028 from roughly US$1.0b on a trailing 12 month basis illustrate how much of the valuation debate comes down to modest top line growth supporting higher margins and returns over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/9t2mqp2i-capital-investment-in-water-infrastructure-will-expand-regulated-base-t1di\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for California Water Service Group on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Mixed signals so far, right?

That supports the idea that profitability, not just top line, is doing more of the work.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls point to wind service and new wind farms as key earnings drivers, and the move from NOK927.6m to NOK1.4b in trailing net income over the last six reported periods is consistent with that stronger earnings story.</li> <li>At the same time, operational issues mentioned in the bearish narrative, like downtime at certain wind farms and lower power prices in Sweden, are not yet visible in these full year margin and earnings figures.

At the same time, the consensus narrative also flags future Medicaid payment reductions, so current profitability and the longer term policy overhang are pulling in different directions.</li> </ul> <h2>Low 8.6x P/E against healthcare peers</h2> <ul> <li>UHS trades on a trailing P/E of 8.6x compared with 23.6x for the wider US healthcare industry and 27x for peers, even though trailing earnings have grown 30.4% year over year and have risen about 7.3% per year over the last five years according to the supplied data.</li> <li>Bulls point to this apparent valuation gap and recent earnings strength as support for their case that the company could justify higher pricing. Yet the current share price of US$204.33 still sits well below the cited DCF fair value of about US$588.00 and below the allowed analyst target of US$253.00, which means the bullish argument about underappreciated growth is being made against forecasts that show earnings and revenue growth of 3.1% and 4.2% per year respectively, both slower than the US market in the inputs.\n    <ul> <li>That tension between a low P/E and slower forecast growth is central to the bullish narrative that outpatient and behavioral expansion, plus technology efficiencies, could support higher margins than the consensus currently embeds.</li> <li>At the same time, the supplied data notes the stock trading materially below the DCF fair value and below US$253.00, which bullish investors treat as evidence that the market is not fully crediting the 30.4% trailing earnings growth and 8.6% margin achieved so far.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that the market is underestimating how sustained earnings growth and margin resilience could shift sentiment if current trends hold, especially with the stock on an 8.6x P/E and trading below both DCF fair value and the US$253.00 analyst target. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6pqkl3yw-new-outpatient-facilities-and-telehealth-will-unlock-secular-market-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Universal Health Services Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>High debt and policy risks against slower 3.1% EPS growth</h2> <ul> <li>The inputs highlight a high level of debt on the balance sheet alongside forecast earnings growth of about 3.1% per year and revenue growth of 4.2% per year, both cited as slower than the broader US market even though trailing net income over the last year is US$1.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on that leverage and on regulatory items such as expected US$360m to US$400m annual cuts to Medicaid supplemental payments by 2032, arguing that slower forecast growth plus higher interest and capital needs make it harder to sustain the 8.6% margin, even though recent results show improved profitability and 30.4% trailing earnings growth that so far have run ahead of those cautious assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>Critics highlight that if net benefit from Medicaid programs falls while revenue growth tracks closer to the 4.2% forecast, the combination of debt servicing and lower reimbursement could pressure earnings even if current EPS of US$23.42 on a trailing basis remains solid today.</li> <li>What challenges the bearish stance somewhat is that, despite these risks being flagged, analysts in the supplied data still reference earnings that have grown 7.3% per year over five years and a current margin above last year, which suggests the operational picture has been resilient so far even as future policy changes are being debated.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that high leverage and policy changes could matter more than recent EPS strength, especially if future growth sits near 3.1% while debt stays elevated. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Universal Health Services Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/rdizidzn-lower-medicaid-payments-and-rising-costs-will-erode-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Universal Health Services on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the bullish and bearish angles laid out, how do they stack up for you right now, and what feels most important for your own portfolio decisions?

The latest twelve month free cash flow is DKK 52,097.16m. Analyst and extrapolated projections suggest free cash flow reaching DKK 145,840.33m in 2030, with a path that includes DKK 41,926.80m in 2026 and DKK 207,436.58m in 2035.

It reflects what the market is willing to pay today for the company’s current profit stream.</p> <p>In simple terms, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more conservative P/E. Novo Nordisk currently trades on a P/E of 10.35x, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 22.54x and a peer average of 26.08x. That raw comparison alone might suggest the stock is priced more cautiously than many of its peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Novo Nordisk is 25.04x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, profit margins, risk characteristics, industry, and market cap. Because it builds in these company specific drivers, it can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison. With the current P/E of 10.35x sitting well below the Fair Ratio of 25.04x, the multiple based view points to the shares looking undervalued on earnings.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/dk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/cph-novo-b/novo-nordisk-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:NOVO B P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71be77aa-1311-4447-b4b8-bcb7f8815b88/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:NOVO B P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

It starts from the equity on the balance sheet, then compares the company’s expected return on that equity to its estimated cost of equity.</p> <p>For Houlihan Lokey, the model uses a Book Value of US$32.92 per share and a Stable EPS of US$9.25 per share, based on weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 4 analysts. The Average Return on Equity used is 25.05%, while the Cost of Equity is US$2.91 per share, implying an Excess Return of US$6.34 per share. The model also factors in a Stable Book Value of US$36.95 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$178.83 per share. Compared with the recent share price of about US$169.10, this suggests the stock is around 5.4% undervalued. This sits within a reasonable margin of error rather than providing a clear bargain signal.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Houlihan Lokey is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Excess Returns</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare what the market is currently willing to pay for the company’s earnings relative to other options.</p> <p>What counts as a reasonable P/E usually reflects two things: how quickly earnings are expected to grow, and how risky those earnings are perceived to be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk typically support a lower multiple.</p> <p>Houlihan Lokey currently trades on a P/E of 26.35x. That sits above both the Capital Markets industry average of 23.01x and the peer group average of 15.39x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Houlihan Lokey is 16.22x, which is its proprietary view of what a balanced P/E could look like after factoring in earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming one size fits all. With the current 26.35x P/E sitting above the 16.22x Fair Ratio, the shares look expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St, within the Community page used by millions of investors, Narratives give you an easy way to set out that story in numbers, see how your view differs from others, and quickly spot when your Fair Value is above or below the current price. This can help you decide whether the stock fits your watchlist or portfolio. Narratives also refresh as new information such as news, earnings or updated analyst estimates are added, so your view does not stay frozen. For Houlihan Lokey, for example, one investor might align with the higher fair value view around US$242.55 per share while another might lean closer to the lower fair value of US$173 per share, and Narratives make those different perspectives clear and comparable in one place.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Houlihan Lokey? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/HLI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-hli/houlihan-lokey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c70f2d67-69b8-455b-920e-4c3e95539baa/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HLI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were US$1.07, compared with US$0.30 a year ago.</p> <p>Across 2025, sales were US$3.62b compared with US$2.82b a year earlier, while net income was US$978 million compared with US$112 million. Full year basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were US$2.56, compared with US$0.31 in the prior year.</p> <p>Alongside the earnings release on February 18, 2026, Pan American Silver declared a cash dividend of US$0.18 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2025, payable on or about March 13, 2026, to shareholders of record as of March 2, 2026. The company described the dividend as an eligible dividend for Canadian income tax purposes and noted that any future dividends will remain at the discretion of its board.</p> <p>The company also updated the market on its share repurchase activity. From October 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025, Pan American Silver bought back 282,700 shares for US$15 million, representing 0.07% of its shares. This completed a program initiated on March 3, 2025, under which the company repurchased a total of 1,650,770 shares for US$46.1 million, representing 0.44% of its outstanding shares.</p> <p>Management has guided to a further 14% increase in silver production in 2026, supported by contributions from the Juanicipio mine and higher grades at Cerro Moro, and plans to release an updated technical report for the La Colorada Skarn project in the second quarter of 2026. These elements sit alongside record 2025 free cash flow and a series of recent dividend increases and form the backdrop for how investors may weigh Pan American Silver’s current valuation and risk profile.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Pan American Silver.</a></p> <p>Investors appear to be responding to the record 2025 results and higher dividend. The share price is at CA$92.37 with a 90 day share price return of 45.83%, while the 1 year total shareholder return of 171.88% and 3 year total shareholder return of roughly 4.7x point to strong longer term momentum.</p> <p>If this earnings driven move has you rethinking precious metals exposure, it could be worth scanning beyond a single name and checking out our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_silver\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473743/top-silver-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">7 top silver producer stocks</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With the shares up 46% in 90 days and trading slightly above the average analyst price target, yet still showing a large intrinsic value gap, is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Price-to-Earnings of 29.1x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On earnings, the market is putting a 29.1x P/E on Pan American Silver at CA$92.37. This sits above both peers and the company’s own estimated fair ratio.</p> <p>The P/E multiple simply tells you how much investors are currently paying for each dollar of earnings. It is a common yardstick for metals and mining companies where profitability matters as much as production volumes.</p> <p>For Pan American Silver, that 29.1x P/E compares with a peer average of 26.4x and an estimated fair P/E of 26.4x. This indicates the market is applying a richer tag than both the sector and the level our fair ratio suggests the price could lean toward over time.</p> <p>Stacked against the broader Canadian Metals and Mining industry, where the average P/E is 22.5x, Pan American Silver’s 29.1x stands out as clearly higher. This signals that investors are currently pricing in stronger earnings prospects or a higher quality profile than the typical name in the group.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Pan American Silver</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 29.1x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you are paying that richer P/E in a sector exposed to metal price swings, as well as Pan American Silver’s multi country operating and regulatory risks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-paas/pan-american-silver-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Pan American Silver narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on value: SWS DCF points the other way</h2> <p>The P/E of 29.1x suggests Pan American Silver looks expensive, but our DCF model tells a different story.

At that time, hardly anyone thought about voice AI. However, over more than two decades, the team accumulated diverse experience with this technology, building a moat of over 280 patents that set it apart from competitors.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Hormel Foods (HRL) opened fiscal Q1 2026 with revenue of about US$3.0 billion and basic EPS of US$0.33, setting a clear snapshot of where the business stands as earnings season gets underway. The company has seen quarterly revenue move in a tight band around US$3.0 billion over the past year, while basic EPS has ranged from a loss of roughly US$0.10 in Q4 2025 to US$0.40 in Q4 2024. This gives investors a mixed but data rich backdrop for judging this quarter. With trailing net profit margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier and earnings forecast to grow faster than revenue, the key question now is how durable Hormel’s margin profile really looks.</p> <a

Income Swings and Margin Pressure</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last six quarters, net income has moved from a loss of US$56.1 million in Q4 2025 to US$181.8 million in Q1 2026, while trailing 12 month profit stands at US$489.4 million on US$12.1b of revenue, aligning with the 4% net margin figure.</li> <li> Bears focus on profitability pressure, and the numbers give them some support alongside some pushback.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing net margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier lines up with concerns about margin compression from volatile input costs like pork, beef, and nuts.</li> <li>At the same time, recent quarterly net income in the US$170 million to US$184 million range across most of the last five quarters, apart from Q4 2025, suggests earnings have remained relatively steady even as longer term margins have tightened.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year Hormel’s margin strain has been a key talking point for skeptics, so this mix of steady recent profits and lower trailing margins makes the bear case more nuanced than a simple profitability decline story. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hormel Foods Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>EPS Stability vs Forecast Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Basic EPS has hovered around US$0.31 to US$0.33 in four of the last five quarters, with a Q4 2025 loss and a Q4 2024 EPS of US$0.40 as the outliers, while earnings are forecast to grow about 11.18% per year compared with roughly 2% revenue growth.</li> <li> The consensus narrative that earnings growth can run ahead of sales growth is tested by this steady but unspectacular EPS pattern.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month EPS of US$0.89 compares with quarterly EPS near US$0.33 in Q1 2026 and Q3 2025, which is below the US$0.40 level seen in Q4 2024 and below earlier trailing EPS figures like US$1.47 a year ago.</li> <li>Forecasts calling for earnings to grow faster than revenue suggest better margins over time, yet today’s trailing 4% net margin and flat recent EPS band show that the margin uplift implied by those forecasts is not visible in the recent history supplied.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rich P/E, Dividend Strain and DCF Upside</h2> <ul> <li>Hormel trades on a trailing P/E of 27.9x versus 24.2x for the broader US Food industry and 13.2x for peers, while offering a 4.71% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings or free cash flow, and a DCF fair value of US$48.41 compared with a current share price of US$24.82.</li> <li> Bulls point to long term earnings growth and valuation upside, and the figures both support and complicate that view.\n    <ul> <li>The stock price of US$24.82 sitting well below the DCF fair value of US$48.41 fits the optimistic claim of meaningful upside if earnings forecasts are met.</li> <li>However, the combination of a premium 27.9x P/E, a 4% trailing net margin, and a dividend that is not well covered means the bullish argument depends heavily on the expected margin improvement and cash generation that are not yet reflected in the trailing data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that richer P/E and stretched dividend against the potential DCF upside, it is worth seeing how bullish investors connect these earnings trends to their long term case for Hormel. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hormel Foods Bull

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth right now.</p> <p>For Astec Industries, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s last twelve months of Free Cash Flow is reported at about $28.24 million. Analysts provide explicit forecasts out to 2027, with Free Cash Flow projected at $82.10 million in that year, and Simply Wall St extends those forecasts further using its own assumptions, out to 2035, keeping everything in dollars and in millions.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today under this model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at about $86.31 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $62.34, the DCF suggests Astec Industries trades at roughly a 27.8% discount, which screens as undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Astec Industries is undervalued by 27.8%.

It is a quick way to see how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risks. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can point to a lower one.</p> <p>Astec Industries currently trades on a P/E of 36.75x. That sits above the Machinery industry average of about 28.70x and below the peer group average of roughly 41.03x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Astec Industries is 30.79x, which is its view of what a reasonable P/E would be after factoring in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the industry, because it adjusts for those business specific characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the actual P/E of 36.75x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 30.79x, Astec Industries appears overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You set out your story for Astec Industries, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and end up with your own Fair Value that you can compare with today’s price on the Community page. This page is used by millions of investors, so your view updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. You can see, for example, one investor building a Narrative that supports a Fair Value of about US$86 per share, while another, more cautious view aligns with a Fair Value closer to US$56.50. Each uses the same company but very different expectations to decide whether the current price looks attractive or not.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Astec Industries? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ASTE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$383.6 million in Q4 2024 to US$490.7 million in Q1 2025, while basic EPS has swung from a small profit of US$0.02 in Q4 2024 to progressively larger quarterly losses through 2025.

That view sits against a five year history where losses widened at roughly 13.2% per year and the latest TTM period still shows US$63.5 million in losses, so the optimistic case leans heavily on a future margin shift that is not visible in these reported numbers.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly losses widened sharply in Q4 2025</h2> <ul> <li>Q4 2025 net income excluding extra items was a loss of US$56.0 million on revenue of US$410.4 million, compared with smaller quarterly losses earlier in 2025 that ranged from about US$0.6 million to US$4.5 million on revenues between US$460.8 million and US$490.7 million.</li> <li>Bears argue that dependence on cyclical equipment demand and large OEM customers could keep earnings under pressure. The pattern in 2025, where quarterly losses moved from roughly US$0.6 million in Q1 to US$56.0 million by Q4 while revenue stayed within a US$410 million to US$491 million band, gives their argument support that profitability has been fragile even without a collapse in the top line.\n    <ul> <li>The data also shows that over the last five years, losses widened at about 13.2% per year, which fits with the cautious view that earnings volatility and operating leverage have worked against shareholders recently.</li> <li>With the share price at US$9.90 and the business still loss making over the last twelve months, skeptics may question how quickly any forecast profit recovery can show through in reported EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bears warn that the latest step up in quarterly losses could signal that tighter OEM spending or cost pressure bites harder than optimistic scenarios assume, especially if order patterns stay uneven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/lubktl12-trade-and-oem-risks-will-delay-recovery-yet-spark-optimism-1mqc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Titan International Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Mixed valuation signals at US$9.90 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The data shows a P/S of 0.3x compared with a peer average of 1.7x and a US Machinery industry average of 2.3x. A DCF fair value of US$7.71 per share sits below the current US$9.90 price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to the low 0.3x P/S multiple and the earnings growth forecasts as backing their case for upside, but the DCF fair value of US$7.71 being below the current share price and the company’s current TTM loss of US$63.5 million mean the market is already pricing in some improvement. That leaves less room for error if revenue growth of 3.7% per year and recent loss trends persist instead of quickly swinging toward the earnings levels implied by an 11.25 analyst target.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus expectations in the data look for revenue growth of 5.5% per year and margins moving from about 1.2% loss making today to a 2.5% profit margin by 2028, so the gap between those future assumptions and today’s US$63.5 million loss is what investors are effectively paying for at US$9.90.</li> <li>If earnings track closer to the more cautious path, where margins are still only 6.0% by 2028 and earnings are US$124.5 million, the current discount to an 11.25 target is smaller than it appears once the DCF fair value of US$7.71 is factored into the range of views.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these valuation signals to their thesis on margins and growth, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Titan International Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Titan International on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the mix of bullish hopes and cautious signals in the numbers, it is worth taking a closer look at the data yourself and moving quickly to shape your own view.

For investors following NYSE:TRNO, the recent leasing activity in California and property acquisitions in New York are consistent with that core business model. Industrial properties tied to distribution and warehouse needs remain central to many supply chain discussions.</p> <p>These new leases and planned redevelopments provide more current data points on where Terreno Realty is active and what types of tenants are occupying its buildings.

On the West Coast, locking in three full building leases in Redondo Beach with a single domestic energy tenant, plus a long dated lease in Rancho Dominguez with a laboratory products company, gives better visibility on occupancy in key infill logistics submarkets. Terminating an in place lease slightly early to accommodate the new Redondo Beach agreements suggests Terreno is prioritizing tenant profile and lease length over a short period of remaining income from the prior tenant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around the Bronx and Queens projects, where planned demolition, interior build out and reconfiguration need to be finished on time and within the US$12.2m and US$103.4m expected investment levels.</li> <li>⚠️ The US$500m at the market follow on equity program could lead to shareholder dilution if new shares are issued without offsetting benefits in earnings or asset quality.</li> <li>🎁 The Bronx asset carries an estimated stabilized cap rate of 5.3% initially and 6.1% after renovation, while Queens is guided at 5.4%, giving investors concrete return targets for these projects.</li> <li>🎁 Long dated leases in Southern California industrial hubs, including one running to 2036, can support more predictable cash flows if tenants perform as expected under their contracts.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, the key questions are execution and capital deployment. On the leasing side, you can watch how quickly the Rancho Dominguez and Redondo Beach tenants take occupancy, and whether there are any disclosed changes to rent terms or renewal activity. On the acquisitions side, progress updates on permitting, demolition and construction at the Bronx and Queens assets will be important to see if the targeted cap rates and timelines hold. Finally, keep an eye on how much of the US$500m follow on equity capacity Terreno actually uses, and at what share prices, because that will shape the balance between portfolio growth and dilution for existing investors.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Terreno Realty, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/TRNO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Terreno Realty</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The Rocket and Redfin alliance directly touches the key near term catalyst of platform adoption by expanding Compass’s digital reach, while the biggest current risk remains that structural shifts in how homes are bought and sold could weaken the traditional agent-centric economics Compass depends on.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the three-year alliance with Rocket Companies and Redfin looks most relevant, because it plugs Compass’s listings and Rocket Mortgage financing into high-traffic consumer channels where buyers already search. For shareholders focused on catalysts around AI and integrated services, this agreement may matter as much as quarterly results, since it tests whether Compass’s technology and data can actually convert broader online exposure and lead flow into better economics per transaction.</p> <p>Yet even with these partnerships, investors should be aware that growing regulatory and platform power could still reshape how much value brokerages like Compass are allowed to keep...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Compass (it's free!)</a></p><p>Compass’ narrative projects $9.1 billion revenue and $275.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Compass' forecasts yield a $13.90 fair value</a>, a 39% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1de63fb6-70ab-4048-a072-49ee626a6c2a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest ranked analysts were assuming only about 11.6 percent annual revenue growth to roughly US$8.7 billion and modest 1.9 percent margins by 2028, so if you worry that tech platforms could eventually marginalize Compass’s agent model, this new Rocket and Redfin partnership might either soften or reinforce that concern depending on how much value you think flows to Compass versus its partners.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Compass</a> - why the stock might be worth just $11.00!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?
