Over the last five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 9.9%, and future earnings are forecast to rise by 12.07% per year, though this pace trails the broader US market’s 15.7% projection. With revenue growth expected at 2.9% per year and margins coming under pressure, investors are contending with a stock that trades at a Price-to-Earnings ratio of 19.8x, which is above industry and peer averages.

That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.

Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

Recent large data center wins and a robust order funnel highlight this trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this modest revenue performance will accelerate.  However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.     </p> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/software/ams-mtrk/motork-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on MotorK </a>will help you uncover what's on the horizon.  <h2> How Is MotorK's Revenue Growth Trending?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the industry for P/S ratios like MotorK's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 11%.   Revenue has also lifted 28% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth.  Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been respectable for the company.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 104% during the coming year according to the sole analyst following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this information, we can see why MotorK is trading at such a high P/S compared to the industry.  Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What Does MotorK's P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> Our look into MotorK shows that its P/S ratio remains high on the merit of its strong future revenues.  It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S.  Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.     </p><p> You should always think about risks.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. </p><p> We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws.  If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><h2> Crunching The Numbers </h2> <p> We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase.  In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years.   Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.  </p><p> A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today,  so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: </p><h4> 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate </h4><table><tr><td> </td><td><strong>2026</strong></td><td><strong>2027</strong></td><td><strong>2028</strong></td><td><strong>2029</strong></td><td><strong>2030</strong></td><td><strong>2031</strong></td><td><strong>2032</strong></td><td><strong>2033</strong></td><td><strong>2034</strong></td><td><strong>2035</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong> Levered FCF (SEK, Millions) </strong></td><td>kr931.5m</td><td>kr1.31b</td><td>kr1.29b</td><td>kr1.58b</td><td>kr1.75b</td><td>kr1.89b</td><td>kr2.01b</td><td>kr2.10b</td><td>kr2.18b</td><td>kr2.25b</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Growth Rate Estimate Source</strong></td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Est @ 10.91%</td><td>Est @ 8.10%</td><td>Est @ 6.14%</td><td>Est @ 4.76%</td><td>Est @ 3.80%</td><td>Est @ 3.12%</td></tr><tr><td><strong> Present Value (SEK, Millions) Discounted @ 5.8% </strong></td><td>kr880</td><td>kr1.2k</td><td>kr1.1k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td></tr></table><p><i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = kr12b</p><p> After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.  The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.8%. </p><p><strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2035</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = kr2.2b× (1 + 1.6%) ÷ (5.8%– 1.6%) = kr53b</p><p><strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= kr53b÷ ( 1 + 5.8%)<sup>10</sup>= kr30b</p><p> The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows,  which in this case is kr42b.  In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.  Compared to the current share price of kr84.1, the company appears   a touch undervalued    at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently.   Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"dcf\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"760\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/247592118-dcf-1-dark-2/1761885552260\" width=\"1706\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:ASKER Discounted Cash Flow October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2> The Assumptions </h2><p> We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows.  You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.  The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.  Given that we are looking at Asker Healthcare Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.  In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Asker Healthcare Group </a></span></p><h3>SWOT Analysis for Asker Healthcare Group</h3><div class=\"sc-8e1a88f-5 dSGGTD\"><div class=\"block strength\"><strong>Strength</strong> <ul><li>Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.</li></ul> <ul><li>Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.</li></ul> <ul><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Balance sheet summary for ASKER.</a></ul> </div><div class=\"block weakness\"><strong>Weakness</strong> <ul><li> No major weaknesses identified for ASKER.</li></ul></div><div class=\"block opportunity\"><strong>Opportunity</strong> <ul><li>Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swedish market.</li></ul> <ul><li>Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.</li></ul> </div><div class=\"block threat\"><strong>Threat</strong> <ul><li>Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.</li></ul> <ul> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What else are analysts forecasting for ASKER?</a></ul> </div></div><h2> Moving On: </h2><p> Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it  ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.  The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool.  Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.  For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.   Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Before this announcement, Meko was paying out 83% of earnings, but a comparatively small 46% of free cash flows.  This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.   </p><p> EPS is set to fall by 1.8% over the next 12 months if recent trends continue.  However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 77%, meaning that most of the company's earnings is being paid out to shareholders.    </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/5686693-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761885570964\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:MEKO Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Meko </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years.      Since 2015, the annual payment back then was SEK7.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of SEK3.90.      Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 5.7% per year.    Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.   </p> <h2>The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited</h2> <p> Given that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon.      Meko hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.   </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Meko's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment.       In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it.      We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.  </p><p> It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.  However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> This week we saw the <strong>Bactiguard Holding AB (publ)</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STO:BACTI B</a>) share price climb by 20%.    But will that heal all the wounds inflicted over 5 years of declines? Unlikely.  In fact, the share price has tumbled down a mountain to land 88% lower after that period.  So we don't gain too much confidence from the recent recovery.  The important question is if the business itself justifies a higher share price in the long term.       While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.  </p><p> While the stock has risen 20% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> Bactiguard Holding wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option.  Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip.  That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.  </p><p> Over five years, Bactiguard Holding grew its revenue at 6.2% per year.   That's a pretty good rate for a long time period.   So it is unexpected to see the stock down 13% per year in the last five years.  The truth is that the growth might be below expectations, and investors are probably worried about the continual losses.      </p><p> The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/241402768-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761885601396\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BACTI B Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> If you are thinking of buying or selling Bactiguard Holding stock, you should check out this <strong>FREE</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">detailed report on its balance sheet</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Bactiguard Holding shareholders are down 56% for the year, but the market itself is up 7.9%.  However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 13% over the last half decade.  We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Bactiguard Holding better, we need to consider many other factors.   Even so, be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-bacti-b/bactiguard-holding-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Bactiguard Holding is showing <strong> 1 warning sign in our investment analysis</strong> </a>, you should know about...    </p><p> We will like Bactiguard Holding better if we see some big insider buys.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr20.85 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.  In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important.   As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.     </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr5.6m for 254.99k shares.  But they sold 128.00k shares for kr3.2m.     Overall, ITAB Shop Concept insiders were net buyers during the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.   Insiders own 12% of ITAB Shop Concept shares, worth about kr634m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The ITAB Shop Concept Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.    However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, ITAB Shop Concept insiders feel good about the company's future.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing ITAB Shop Concept.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if DXC Technology is a bargain right now? Let’s take a closer look beneath the headlines to see if this stock could be flying under the radar.</li> <li>Despite a rough patch, shares have dropped 3.2% in the past week, are down 5.1% over the past month, and have fallen an eye-catching 34.5% so far this year. Investors are curious if this signals greater risk or uncovers an opportunity.</li> <li>These declines follow several headlines about DXC Technology’s ongoing strategic shifts and industry partnerships, both of which have stirred up speculation about the company’s future direction.

This approach aims to reveal what a business is really worth today, based solely on its ability to generate cash in the future.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology’s current Free Cash Flow sits at approximately $909.5 Million. Analysts provide direct projections for the next five years, and thereafter, Simply Wall St extrapolates further using reasonable industry estimates. By 2027, forecasted Free Cash Flow is around $650.43 Million, with a ten-year projection pointing to roughly $514.09 Million by 2035. Despite a moderate decline over time, these numbers show a steady cash-generating foundation.\n</p> <p> According to the DCF model using these cash flow estimates, the fair value per share comes out to $27.43. This is 52.8% higher than the current share price. This suggests the stock is significantly undervalued by the market.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests DXC Technology is undervalued by 52.8%.

Since it compares a company’s current share price against its earnings per share, the PE ratio gives investors a quick sense of how the market is valuing its profitability.\n</p> <p> Of course, what qualifies as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors. Companies with faster earnings growth or lower risk typically deserve higher PE ratios, while those facing slower growth or more uncertainty tend to trade on lower multiples.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology currently trades at a PE ratio of just 6.1x. This stands out sharply against the Information Technology industry average of 29.3x and the average among direct peers at 20.7x. Such a discount hints that investors may have concerns, but it could also point to untapped value.\n</p> <p> Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” for DXC Technology is 18.7x. The Fair Ratio is calculated with a more holistic view than just industry or peer averages.

A Narrative is your personalized investment story, where you combine your outlook on a company, such as its future revenue, earnings, and margins, with what you believe to be its fair value based on your own reasoning or research.\n</p> <p> Narratives bridge the gap between stories and spreadsheets, linking your perspective about DXC Technology’s business prospects directly to a financial forecast and a resulting fair value estimate. Best of all, Narratives are designed to be easy to use and are available for everyone on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share their views.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly determine whether now might be a good time to buy or sell by comparing your Fair Value to the current Price, helping you make decisions based on your specific expectations rather than just the market consensus or analyst targets.\n</p> <p> Because Narratives update automatically when new news or earnings reports are released, your investment thesis stays fresh and relevant as the situation changes. For example, some investors see strong AI and cloud partnerships as reasons to assign a fair value of $18.00 per share, while cautious investors note ongoing revenue declines and set their fair value at just $14.00. This demonstrates how Narrative tools empower you to act on the view that fits you best.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for DXC Technology? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/01cae35e-7765-4441-9380-6df0f878fcc2/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Hut 8 trades at 33.3x earnings, which is below the software industry average of 34.1x but well above its fair ratio of 17.5x. This suggests investors may be assigning a premium for growth, which adds extra valuation risk if expectations slip.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Those holding <strong>Erika Carmel-Tech Ltd</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:ERKA</a>) shares would be relieved that the share price has rebounded 54% in the last thirty days, but it needs to keep going to repair the recent damage it has caused to investor portfolios.    But the gains over the last month weren't enough to make shareholders whole, as the share price is still down 6.2% in the last twelve months.   </p><p> Although its price has surged higher, Erika Carmel-Tech may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 0.6x, since almost half of all companies in the Medical Equipment industry in Israel have P/S ratios greater than 2x and even P/S higher than 7x are not unusual.

One possibility is that the P/S is low because investors think this respectable revenue growth might actually underperform the broader industry in the near future.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.    </p> Although there are no analyst estimates available for Erika Carmel-Tech, take a look at this <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>data-rich visualisation </a>to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Erika Carmel-Tech?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Erika Carmel-Tech's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 21%.   Still, revenue has fallen 47% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing.  Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the industry, which is predicted to deliver 21% growth in the next 12 months, the company's downward momentum based on recent medium-term revenue results is a sobering picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, we think shrinking revenues are unlikely to lead to a stable P/S over the longer term, which could set up shareholders for future disappointment.  There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S? </h2><p> Erika Carmel-Tech's stock price has surged recently, but its but its P/S still remains modest.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> Our examination of Erika Carmel-Tech confirms that the company's shrinking revenue over the past medium-term is a key factor in its low price-to-sales ratio, given the industry is projected to grow.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio.  Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Before you take the next step, you should know about the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for Erika Carmel-Tech</strong></a> that we have uncovered.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Erika Carmel-Tech's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",
