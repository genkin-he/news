On a last twelve months basis, the company reported free cash flow of a $448.9 million loss, so the valuation leans heavily on future projections rather than recent cash generation.</p> <p>The projections indicate free cash flow turning positive and reaching $1,233 million in 2028, with further annual figures out to 2035 derived from analyst inputs and extrapolations by Simply Wall St. These ten-year free cash flow estimates, all in dollars, are then discounted back using the DCF framework.</p> <p>According to this model, the estimated intrinsic value is about $61.83 per share, compared with the current share price of around $25.02. This difference suggests a 59.5% discount to the DCF estimate, indicating that the shares are trading materially below this model’s assessment of value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is undervalued by 59.5%.

This makes it a useful cross check against the DCF result you just saw.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E is usually shaped by how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and perceived resilience can justify a higher multiple, while more risk or slower growth often points to a lower one.</p> <p>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings currently trades on a P/E of 17.17x. That sits below the Hospitality industry average of about 23.54x and the peer group average of 43.21x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 35.89x, which reflects factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is designed to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry. It adjusts for company specific characteristics rather than assuming all firms deserve the same multiple. Set against this Fair Ratio of 35.89x, the current P/E of 17.17x suggests the shares are trading at a discount on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:NCLH P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/654e2d37-dd13-432b-8818-b17595112856/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:NCLH P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

It then compares that fair value with the current share price to help you decide whether you see room to buy more, trim or simply watch.</p> <p>Because Narratives on Simply Wall St update automatically when new earnings, news or valuation inputs are added, you can see in real time how different views stack up. For example, one Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Narrative currently anchors on a fair value near US$19.00, while another sits closer to about US$45.00, showing how two investors using the same company can reach very different conclusions based on their assumptions and what risks or opportunities they choose to focus on.</p> <p>For Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives give you a structured way to line up your view of the business with specific assumptions on growth, margins and a fair value, so you can see exactly what would need to be true for your thesis to hold.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/s8dfnukw-norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-will-continue-to-rise-in-2025?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish Narrative: US$45.00 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: about 44% below the Narrative fair value at the recent price of US$25.02</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth in the Narrative: 26.04% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on cruise travel demand, with AAA data pointing to record US cruise passengers in 2025 compared with both last year and pre COVID levels.</li> <li>Highlights recent refinancing of US$1.8b of senior notes and access to a US$1.7b revolving facility as key moves to reshape the balance sheet and extend debt maturities.</li> <li>Points to sector wide strength, technical momentum, a US$34 price target from one major bank and ongoing fleet investments as reasons the author sees meaningful upside potential.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/consumer-services/nyse-nclh/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings/eydrh5kh-tighter-environmental-rules-and-heavy-debt-will-squeeze-margins-x2g6?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this cautious Narrative: US$19.00 per share</p> <p>Gap to this fair value: about 32% above the Narrative fair value at the recent price of US$25.02</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth in the Narrative: 9.27% per year</p> <ul> <li>Flags tighter environmental regulation, overtourism concerns and potential restrictions at key ports as long term risks for costs, access to high value routes and demand.</li> <li>Emphasizes the company’s debt load and interest costs, as well as demographic shifts among younger travelers, as constraints on reinvestment and earnings power.</li> <li>Works through a bearish analyst framework that assumes 8.2% annual revenue growth, higher profit margins and a future P/E of 10.1x, leading to a US$23.00 bearish price target that sits close to the recent share price.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame a wide range of outcomes, from a bullish view anchored on strong cruise demand and refinancing progress to a more cautious stance centered on regulation, leverage and capacity risks. The value for you is in comparing their assumptions with your own and deciding which story, if either, lines up with how you see Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The completed US$100.05m buyback, covering 0.59% of shares, also adds context for recent investor activity by indicating that the company has been returning capital while investors trade the stock on interest-rate expectations.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Invitation Homes Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Measured 2026 same-store revenue growth guidance and recent earnings support the narrative that steady rental demand and operational efficiency can underpin long-term earnings for a large single-family rental owner.</li> <li>Soft pricing on new leases and rising operating expenses challenge the idea that Sun Belt and suburban markets automatically translate into strong rent growth and expanding margins.</li> <li>The scale of recent share repurchases and the impact of regulatory scrutiny on future acquisition-driven growth are not fully captured in the narrative and could influence how investors think about portfolio expansion versus capital returns.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/4lj7ec1o-analysts-adjust-invitation-homes-price-targets-amid-sector-reassessment-and-modest-valuation-changes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Invitation Homes</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Analysts highlight that earnings are forecast to decline by an average of 2% per year over the next 3 years, which could limit support for a high P/E if growth expectations reset.</li> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which can matter more for a rate-sensitive REIT if borrowing costs do not ease as quickly as some investors expect.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings grew by 29.5% over the past year, giving investors a recent track record of profit growth to weigh against more cautious forward expectations.</li> <li>🎁 The stock is described as trading at 41.9% below one estimate of fair value, which some investors may see as room for upside if the single-family rental model remains resilient versus peers such as American Homes 4 Rent and Tricon Residential.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how Invitation Homes converts its 1.3% to 2.5% same-store core revenue growth target into cash flow after higher insurance, taxes, and maintenance, as well as how renewal rent trends compare with weaker new-lease pricing. Fed policy decisions and any change in commentary around institutional ownership of single-family homes could influence both borrowing costs and sentiment. It is also worth tracking how management balances further buybacks against potential portfolio growth, especially relative to other residential REITs such as Equity Residential and Mid-America Apartment Communities.</p> <p>To stay updated on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Invitation Homes, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/INVH\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Invitation Homes</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether CorMedix stock is priced attractively or already baking in a lot of optimism, you are in the right place to unpack what the current share price might be implying.</li> <li>CorMedix recently closed at US$7.35, with returns of 3.8% over the past 7 days, a 5.2% decline over 30 days, a 39.6% decline year to date, and a 28.3% decline over 1 year, set against a 73.8% return over 3 years and 3.7% over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage of CorMedix has focused on its position within the pharmaceuticals and biotech space and how investors are reacting to company specific developments rather than broad market moves. This backdrop helps explain why the share price has seen both shorter term weakness and stronger multi year returns as sentiment has shifted over time.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, CorMedix scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>.

Analysts provide specific Free Cash Flow estimates for the coming years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path. On this basis, projected Free Cash Flow reaches $209.8 million in 2030, with additional years beyond that also modeled in millions of US dollars.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $91.95 per share. Compared to the recent share price of US$7.35, this suggests the stock is 92.0% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CorMedix is undervalued by 92.0%.

It helps you compare CorMedix with other businesses that also generate earnings in the same sector.</p> <p>A higher or lower P/E often reflects what the market expects for future growth and how risky those earnings might be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk can justify a lower one.</p> <p>CorMedix currently trades on a P/E of 3.56x. That is below the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.89x and below the peer average of 9.43x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” for CorMedix of 15.70x, which is an estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for growth characteristics, risk and profitability instead of assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. When you compare CorMedix’s current P/E of 3.56x with the Fair Ratio of 15.70x, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you compare that Fair Value with today’s price and decide if CorMedix at, say, a more bullish US$22.00 view or a more cautious US$14.00 view is closer to your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CorMedix? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/CRMD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new Mississippi and Ohio river sailings strengthen the near term catalyst of strong advance bookings by adding more heritage-led product in the key U.S. market, but they do not materially change the biggest current risk around elevated leverage and exposure to older, premium travelers.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the multi year marketing partnership with the PGA TOUR through 2030 is especially relevant. Together with the new Mississippi and Ohio cruises, it reinforces Viking’s push into the U.S., supporting the catalyst of capacity expansion into new geographies and potentially helping sustain strong booking trends that analysts are watching ahead of the upcoming Q4 2025 results on March 3, 2026.</p> <p>Yet beneath the appeal of Viking’s new itineraries, investors should also be aware of how its high debt and older customer base could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-services/nyse-vik/viking-holdings/ty502cz7-global-expansion-will-unlock-premium-travel-experiences-7q8c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Viking Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>Viking Holdings' narrative projects $8.5 billion revenue and $2.0 billion earnings by 2028.

The latest earnings beat and return to profitability strengthen the case that scale and higher storage attachment can support margins, but the biggest near term swing factor is still access to affordable capital, while long term policy uncertainty around incentives remains a key overhang. This quarter’s results do not remove those risks, but they do improve Sunrun’s financial footing.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is Sunrun’s completion of the PG&amp;E Local PeakShift Power season, where over 1,000 customer systems delivered nearly 1,200 hours of highly accurate dispatch. Paired with storage attachment rates reaching 71% by year end 2025, this grid services performance gives more substance to the idea that batteries and virtual power plants could become a meaningful earnings driver, potentially offsetting some pressure from expiring tax credits and higher financing costs over time.</p> <p>Yet while the profit rebound is encouraging, investors should also be aware that concentrated policy risk around solar tax credits could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunrun (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunrun's narrative projects $2.9 billion revenue and $465.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunrun's forecasts yield a $22.74 fair value</a>, a 11% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa2a4c7-de78-47ca-906e-c5edae8a6116/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this surprise profit, the most bearish analysts assumed almost flat revenue growth near US$2.1 billion and no profitability, so their far more cautious view of Sunrun’s financing and policy risks may shift meaningfully as investors reassess those assumptions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Sunrun</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model. It updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive, and is available on the Community page where millions of investors share their own versions.</p> <p>For example, one National Energy Services Reunited Narrative might align with the bullish analyst fair value of US$30.00, built around confidence in hydraulic fracturing capacity and MENA contracts. Another could sit nearer the cautious US$10.00 view that focuses on regional concentration and energy transition risks. Seeing those side by side can help you decide whether the current US$25.14 price is above or below the story you find most convincing.</p> <p>For National Energy Services Reunited, here are previews of two leading National Energy Services Reunited narratives that may help frame the discussion:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/lj4o0x5w-rising-mena-demand-will-boost-oilfield-service-expansion-mfij?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 National Energy Services Reunited Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 16.1% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 19.65% a year</p> <ul> <li>Supports a higher fair value case built around hydraulic fracturing scale in Saudi Arabia, contract visibility across MENA and higher profit margins tied to technology and efficiency gains.</li> <li>Assumes National Energy Services Reunited can sustain robust revenue growth and margin expansion, with future earnings and P/E considered consistent with a US$30.00 anchor valuation.</li> <li>Notes meaningful risks from oilfield concentration, regional exposure and capital intensity, so the optimistic outcome still depends on execution and stable operating conditions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/1sh65zqm-revenue-recovery-and-sector-rebound-will-drive-long-term-shareholder-returns?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 National Energy Services Reunited Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this more cautious narrative: US$22.14 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 13.5% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.93% a year</p> <ul> <li>Frames the story around solid MENA contracts and Jafurah exposure, but anchors fair value closer to US$22.14, even with updated analyst targets around US$30.</li> <li>Builds in steady revenue growth and margin improvement, while assuming a more modest future P/E multiple compared with the bullish view.</li> <li>Highlights contract concentration, capital demands, working capital strain and long term energy transition as key risks that could keep the share price nearer this fair value.</li> </ul> <p>Viewed together, these narratives provide two different sets of assumptions for National Energy Services Reunited that can be compared with the current US$25.14 share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for National Energy Services Reunited? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/NESR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The immediate catalyst is the 3 March 2026 Q4 2025 earnings release, which sits at the center of the recent analyst optimism. The biggest near term risk is that expectations for continued revenue and earnings momentum are now elevated, so any disappointment could magnify share price volatility.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement is On’s 10 February 2026 confirmation of its Q4 2025 earnings date. With analysts already highlighting prior earnings surprises and solid revenue growth, this specific release has become a focal point for testing the bullish thesis on margins, DTC progress and international scaling. How the company’s reported sales and profitability compare with these expectations may either reinforce, or start to question, the current enthusiasm embedded in the shares.</p> <p>Yet beneath the upbeat commentary, the risk that heavy reliance on premium pricing could eventually face pushback is something investors should be aware of...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-onon/on-holding/pr8lhrz5-analyst-commentary-reveals-mixed-views-as-on-holding-adjusts-guidance-and-targets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on On Holding (it's free!)</a></p><p>On Holding’s narrative projects CHF5.0 billion revenue and CHF561.2 million earnings by 2028.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $343.7 million. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2030, with free cash flow projections moving from a loss of $146 million in 2026 and $13 million in 2027, to positive cash flows of $143 million in 2028, $231 million in 2029 and $313 million in 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates further free cash flow estimates out to 2035 using its own growth assumptions.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $23.63 per share. Compared with the recent share price around $3.79, this implies the stock is about 84.0% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iovance Biotherapeutics is undervalued by 84.0%.

Slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower one. That is why it helps to look at Iovance Biotherapeutics in the context of both its industry and its own fundamentals.</p> <p>Iovance Biotherapeutics currently trades on a P/S of 5.93x. This sits below the Biotechs industry average of 12.58x and also below the peer average of 6.82x provided. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the company is 4.19x, which is an estimate of the P/S multiple that might be reasonable given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Compared with simple peer or industry comparisons, the Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored to the company’s profile.</p> <p>Putting that together, Iovance Biotherapeutics’ actual P/S of 5.93x is above the Fair Ratio of 4.19x, which points to the shares pricing in a richer multiple than this framework suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/af2848b1-cfd3-42ac-adb3-fafd0b7d60eb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.
