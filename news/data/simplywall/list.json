            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>National Energy Services Reunited (NasdaqCM:NESR) picked up a major multibillion-dollar contract with Saudi Aramco, promising five years of completion and unconventional gas development services. This deal is closely tied to Saudi Arabia’s broader Vision 2030 energy ambitions.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for National Energy Services Reunited.</a></p> <p>With the momentum of this mega-contract announcement, National Energy Services Reunited shares have surged, posting a 33% share price return in the last month and an impressive 113.8% over the past quarter. Long-term investors have been rewarded too, as the stock’s five-year total shareholder return now exceeds 100%. This is a reflection of both market optimism and the company’s ongoing execution.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) posted a 7.8% annual earnings growth rate over the past five years and has recently returned to profitability, with net profit margins showing year-over-year improvement. The company’s latest results, however, were marked by a one-off $6.1 billion loss, and forward guidance points to a 6.3% annual decline in revenue and a 2.9% annual decrease in earnings over the next three years. Despite shares trading at $45.62, well below the estimated fair value of $132.29, the stock’s valuation appears stretched relative to peers and its industry averages based on its price-to-earnings ratio.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-bmy/bristol-myers-squibb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Bristol-Myers Squibb.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers head-to-head with the major market narratives.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins. Achieving this may prove challenging without clear pipeline successes.</li> <li>Investors may face a value-versus-quality decision, with an appealing entry price tempered by skepticism regarding future growth and profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bristol-myers-squibb-bmy-undervalued-opportunity-or-value-trap-a-deep-dive-into-2024-earnings-and-fair-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bristol-Myers Squibb on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a unique take on the figures?

That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.

Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this modest revenue performance will accelerate.  However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.     </p> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/software/ams-mtrk/motork-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on MotorK </a>will help you uncover what's on the horizon.  <h2> How Is MotorK's Revenue Growth Trending?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the industry for P/S ratios like MotorK's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 11%.   Revenue has also lifted 28% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth.  Therefore, it's fair to say the revenue growth recently has been respectable for the company.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 104% during the coming year according to the sole analyst following the company.  That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% growth forecast for the broader industry. </p><p> With this information, we can see why MotorK is trading at such a high P/S compared to the industry.  Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What Does MotorK's P/S Mean For Investors? </h2><p> Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> Our look into MotorK shows that its P/S ratio remains high on the merit of its strong future revenues.  It appears that shareholders are confident in the company's future revenues, which is propping up the P/S.  Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.     </p><p> You should always think about risks.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. </p><p> We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws.  If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><h2> Crunching The Numbers </h2> <p> We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase.  In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years.   Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.  </p><p> A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today,  so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: </p><h4> 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate </h4><table><tr><td> </td><td><strong>2026</strong></td><td><strong>2027</strong></td><td><strong>2028</strong></td><td><strong>2029</strong></td><td><strong>2030</strong></td><td><strong>2031</strong></td><td><strong>2032</strong></td><td><strong>2033</strong></td><td><strong>2034</strong></td><td><strong>2035</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong> Levered FCF (SEK, Millions) </strong></td><td>kr931.5m</td><td>kr1.31b</td><td>kr1.29b</td><td>kr1.58b</td><td>kr1.75b</td><td>kr1.89b</td><td>kr2.01b</td><td>kr2.10b</td><td>kr2.18b</td><td>kr2.25b</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Growth Rate Estimate Source</strong></td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x4</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Analyst x1</td><td>Est @ 10.91%</td><td>Est @ 8.10%</td><td>Est @ 6.14%</td><td>Est @ 4.76%</td><td>Est @ 3.80%</td><td>Est @ 3.12%</td></tr><tr><td><strong> Present Value (SEK, Millions) Discounted @ 5.8% </strong></td><td>kr880</td><td>kr1.2k</td><td>kr1.1k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td><td>kr1.3k</td></tr></table><p><i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = kr12b</p><p> After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.  The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.8%. </p><p><strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2035</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = kr2.2b× (1 + 1.6%) ÷ (5.8%– 1.6%) = kr53b</p><p><strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= kr53b÷ ( 1 + 5.8%)<sup>10</sup>= kr30b</p><p> The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows,  which in this case is kr42b.  In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.  Compared to the current share price of kr84.1, the company appears   a touch undervalued    at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently.   Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"dcf\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"760\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/247592118-dcf-1-dark-2/1761885552260\" width=\"1706\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:ASKER Discounted Cash Flow October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2> The Assumptions </h2><p> We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows.  You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.  The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.  Given that we are looking at Asker Healthcare Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.  In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. </p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Asker Healthcare Group </a></span></p><h3>SWOT Analysis for Asker Healthcare Group</h3><div class=\"sc-8e1a88f-5 dSGGTD\"><div class=\"block strength\"><strong>Strength</strong> <ul><li>Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.</li></ul> <ul><li>Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.</li></ul> <ul><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Balance sheet summary for ASKER.</a></ul> </div><div class=\"block weakness\"><strong>Weakness</strong> <ul><li> No major weaknesses identified for ASKER.</li></ul></div><div class=\"block opportunity\"><strong>Opportunity</strong> <ul><li>Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swedish market.</li></ul> <ul><li>Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.</li></ul> </div><div class=\"block threat\"><strong>Threat</strong> <ul><li>Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.</li></ul> <ul> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta-swot\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-asker/asker-healthcare-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What else are analysts forecasting for ASKER?</a></ul> </div></div><h2> Moving On: </h2><p> Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it  ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.  The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool.  Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.  For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.   Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Before this announcement, Meko was paying out 83% of earnings, but a comparatively small 46% of free cash flows.  This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.   </p><p> EPS is set to fall by 1.8% over the next 12 months if recent trends continue.  However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 77%, meaning that most of the company's earnings is being paid out to shareholders.    </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/5686693-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761885570964\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:MEKO Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-meko/meko-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Meko </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years.      Since 2015, the annual payment back then was SEK7.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of SEK3.90.      Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 5.7% per year.    Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.   </p> <h2>The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are Limited</h2> <p> Given that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon.      Meko hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years.   </p> <h2>Our Thoughts On Meko's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment.       In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it.      We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.  </p><p> It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.  However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.
