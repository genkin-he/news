This gives investors a clear view of where the top line stands in relation to still negative earnings. The company has reported quarterly revenue moving from US$404.5 million in Q3 2024 to US$349.0 million in Q4 2025, while quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$0.51 in Q4 2024 to a loss of US$0.23 in the latest quarter.

However, these numbers show the portfolio still working through uneven performance:\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative highlights reinvestment and automation as supports for stronger margins, but FY 2025 net income stayed in loss territory each quarter, including a Q2 profit of only US$7.4 million before swinging back to a Q4 loss of US$26.2 million.</li> <li>Supporters expecting higher cash flow from redeveloped assets need to weigh that view against a trailing twelve month basic EPS loss of US$0.90 and the absence of sustained positive net income in the recent data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Modest 2.3% revenue growth vs faster US market</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, trailing twelve month revenue is reported at US$1.48b with a 2.3% annual growth rate, compared with a cited 10.4% annual growth rate for the broader US market.</li> <li>Bears argue that slower growth and urban exposure cap Pebblebrook's long run potential, and the recent data gives that view some backing:\n    <ul> <li>Revenue across FY 2025 quarters ranged between US$320.3 million and US$407.5 million, which lines up with the description of modest growth rather than a strong acceleration ahead of the wider market.</li> <li>With the company still loss making on a trailing twelve month basis despite that 2.3% growth, critics focused on pressures in urban markets and competition from alternative lodging will see these figures as consistent with their concerns about revenue and margin pressure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears who think the current US$13.18 share price does not fully reflect these growth headwinds may want to see how the more cautious narrative frames the same numbers before making up their mind. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f9ivh6hr-urban-hotels-will-suffer-from-weaker-demand-and-escalating-costs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Discounted P/S and gap to DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/S of about 1x and are described as around 28.9% below a DCF fair value of roughly US$18.54, based on a current share price of US$13.18.</li> <li>Bulls see this as a valuation opportunity if earnings recover, and the figures create an interesting tension with the still negative trailing results:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters highlight forecast earnings growth of 66.02% a year and an expectation of returning to profitability within three years.

It focuses on what the bank earns on its equity relative to its cost of equity.</p> <p>For OceanFirst Financial, the model uses a Book Value of US$28.97 per share and a Stable EPS of US$1.62 per share, based on the median return on equity from the past 5 years. The Average Return on Equity is 6.26%, compared with a Cost of Equity of US$2.18 per share. This setup leads to an Excess Return of US$0.56 per share and a Stable Book Value of US$25.85 per share, which is based on weighted future book value estimates from three analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$14.69 per share. Against the recent share price of US$19.04, this implies the stock is around 29.6% overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests OceanFirst Financial may be overvalued by 29.6%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for OceanFirst Financial.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: OceanFirst Financial Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable bank like OceanFirst Financial, the P/E ratio is a practical way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger earnings growth or see lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more muted or risks feel higher.</p> <p>OceanFirst Financial currently trades on a P/E of 16.28x. That sits above the Banks industry average P/E of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.76x, so the market is currently paying a higher price for its earnings than these broad reference points suggest.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might make sense for OceanFirst Financial specifically, given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is 26.69x, which is materially higher than the current 16.28x. On this view, the shares appear undervalued relative to what the model suggests could be a more company specific P/E level.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St these Narratives live on the Community page, where millions of investors can set a fair value and compare it with the current price to help frame buy or sell decisions. They can then see that view update automatically as new news or earnings come in. For OceanFirst Financial, one investor might build a Narrative around the higher US$22.75 price target with stronger revenue and margin assumptions, while another anchors on the US$18.50 target with more conservative expectations, and both can see in real time how their story, numbers and fair value stay aligned with the latest information.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OceanFirst Financial? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/OCFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For a tanker owner with $294.82m of revenue and earnings that include large one off items, this kind of sales multiple can reflect expectations that current conditions in shipping will support stronger profitability than recent reported margins suggest.</p> <p>Against peers, the gap is clear. The company trades at a 3.9x P/S ratio, while the US Oil and Gas industry average is 1.7x. In other words, the stock is priced at more than double that reference point.

However, the key near term catalyst still rests on execution of cost reductions, while the main risk remains weak, volatile replacement and commercial tire demand.</p> <p>In that context, Goodyear’s recent Q4 2025 results are relevant: full year 2025 sales were US$18,280 million with a net loss of US$1,721 million, even as Q4 profitability improved. Any tariff refunds or lower net import costs could influence how much of future cash flow can be directed toward the Goodyear Forward restructuring program, manufacturing upgrades, and premium tire initiatives, which many investors see as central to the margin recovery story.</p> <p>Yet behind this potential relief, investors should be aware of how persistent tariff and import cost uncertainty could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (it's free!)</a></p><p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's narrative projects $18.3 billion revenue and $405.2 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's forecasts yield a $9.89 fair value</a>, a 17% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/69a7a862-2f07-48af-8a61-58d950ec00f0/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting revenue around US$19.4 billion and earnings near US$403 million by 2028, yet the recent tariff shake up could either reinforce their view of tariff driven localization benefits or highlight the contrasting risk that persistently high trade costs and supply chain friction might keep Goodyear’s margins far below those upbeat expectations.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber</a> - why the stock might be worth 10% less than the current price!</p><h2>Decide For Yourself</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates through 2027, including $60.7 million for 2026 and $39.9 million for 2027. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates free cash flow out to 2035, with projected figures such as $29.7 million in 2028 and around $19.7 million by 2035, all in dollars, and then discounts them back using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach.</p> <p>Bringing all those discounted cash flows together gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $10.06 per share under this DCF model. Compared with the latest share price of $59.18, this implies the stock is very expensive relative to this cash flow based estimate, with the model indicating it is 488.4% overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Benchmark Electronics may be overvalued by 488.4%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BHE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Benchmark Electronics.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Benchmark Electronics Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable business, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to see how much you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to what the company is currently earning, which is often the first anchor investors use when they look at valuation.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower P/E.</p> <p>Benchmark Electronics is trading on a P/E of 85.0x, compared with an industry average of about 27.6x and a peer average of 63.8x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Benchmark Electronics is 42.3x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own profile rather than assuming all electronics companies deserve similar multiples. With the current P/E at 85.0x versus a Fair Ratio of 42.3x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out your story for Benchmark Electronics, link it to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and arrive at your own fair value. You can then easily compare this with the current price, view it alongside other Narratives on the Community page used by millions of investors, and watch it update automatically as new information like earnings or guidance comes in. One investor might build a Narrative that aligns closely with the current model fair value of about US$59.33, while another could plug in more cautious or more optimistic assumptions and land on a very different fair value. This in turn guides how each of them thinks about whether the share price is high, low or roughly in line with their view.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Benchmark Electronics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/BHE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-bhe/benchmark-electronics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/320feba7-0138-4717-a0d4-11474a4ecb9a/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BHE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Geely Automobile Holdings is attractively priced or not, this article will walk you through what the current share price might be implying about its value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at HK$16.31, with a 7 day return of 4.3% decline, a 30 day return of 1.3% decline, a year to date return of 10.4% decline, a 1 year return of 12.4% decline and a 3 year return of 66.1% alongside a 5 year return of 27.7% decline. This gives a mixed picture for investors weighing recent weakness against longer term performance.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Geely has focused on its position in the Hong Kong auto sector and how sentiment has shifted between traditional and newer energy vehicle makers. This helps frame these share price moves. Longer term discussions in the press about competition, regulation and consumer demand for different vehicle types also sit in the background for anyone trying to judge whether the current level makes sense.</li> <li>Right now Geely holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a> on our checks.

The latest twelve month free cash flow sits at about CN¥5.9b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2027, with CN¥31.5b projected for 2026 and CN¥33.7b for 2027, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to 2035, reaching a projected free cash flow of CN¥45.4b in that year.</p> <p>When all these projected cash flows are discounted back using the DCF model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at HK$45.24 per share. Compared with the recent share price of HK$16.31, this suggests the stock is 63.9% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Geely Automobile Holdings is undervalued by 63.9%.

This can be more meaningful than looking at revenue or assets alone.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on what the market thinks about a company’s earnings growth and risk. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Geely currently trades on a P/E of 9.41x. That sits below the Auto industry average of 19.30x and also below the peer group average of 10.79x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Geely is 11.12x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable after considering factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk. It can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for Geely’s own characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 9.41x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 11.12x, the shares appear undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/hk/automobiles/hkg-175/geely-automobile-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b88141a8-605a-48f8-a2ba-1abfcf0c9a7d/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:175 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This points to a large valuation gap based on that framework.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>CSL Limited exhibits strong fundamental characteristics, underpinned by leadership in plasma therapies and influenza vaccines, a robust R&amp;D pipeline, and clear drivers for earnings growth, particularly the ongoing recovery of CSL Behring's gross margin. The integration of CSL Vifor adds diversification, although it faces near term competitive pressures.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how that fair value is built? The narrative leans heavily on earnings expansion, margin rebuild in plasma, and a long runway of cash flows that are anything but simple.</p> <p>According to Ramsee, the author of this narrative, the valuation work uses a discounted cash flow model with a 4.0% discount rate and a long forecast period, treating CSL as a company whose cash generation can be projected and then brought back to today in A$ terms. The gap between the A$263.33 fair value and A$146.76 last close is tied to assumptions about revenue growth, margin recovery and capital intensity across Behring, Seqirus and Vifor, rather than short term share price moves.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of A$263.33 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_user_generated_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/r941wllm-csl-is-undervalued-in-high-tax-scenario\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this hinges on tariff assumptions and CSL hitting its margin goals, with tougher US trade rules or slower Behring recovery both potential spoilers for that thesis.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/pharmaceuticals-biotech/asx-csl/csl-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this CSL narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another Way To Look At It: Earnings Multiple Check</h2> <p>Ramsee’s work leans on discounted cash flows, but the current P/E of 35.8x tells a different story. It sits above the Global Biotechs average of 29.5x and above the 29.3x fair ratio the market could move towards, even though it is below a 60.8x peer average.

The latest wider-than-expected quarterly loss keeps the near term risk centered on cash burn and execution, while the main catalyst is still whether CleanSpark can convert its power footprint into signed, revenue-generating AI data center leases. This update reinforces that tension but does not fundamentally change it.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is management’s progress on securing AI data center leases tied to its Texas power footprint, highlighted again with this quarter’s results. This matters because it links existing mining infrastructure and power access to a potential new revenue stream in AI and HPC, directly related to the current investor focus. If those leases materialize on reasonable terms, they could become the key short term proof point for the entire pivot.</p> <p>Yet beneath the AI story, investors should still be aware of how exposed CleanSpark remains to Bitcoin price volatility and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-clsk/cleanspark/u7vzh41w-analysts-boost-cleanspark-price-target-highlighting-growth-catalysts-and-improved-profit-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on CleanSpark (it's free!)</a></p><p>CleanSpark's narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $319.0 million earnings by 2028.

At the same time, the biggest risk remains execution and capital intensity as MARA retools sites while still being exposed to bitcoin‑driven earnings swings.</p> <p>The Starwood agreement also interacts with MARA’s pending Q4 2025 results, where analysts were already watching for updates on diversification beyond mining. Against that backdrop, the recently announced US$850,000,000 convertible notes offering is especially relevant, since it highlights how much funding this transition could require and why dilution and leverage are important short term watchpoints alongside the promise of AI‑aligned data centers.</p> <p>But while the upside story is clear, investors should also be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-mara/mara-holdings/rieem6ia-mara-expanding-industry-leadership-will-drive-long-term-sector-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MARA Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>MARA Holdings' narrative projects $1.1 billion revenue and $31.5 million earnings by 2028.
