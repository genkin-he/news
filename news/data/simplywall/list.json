            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered whether Broadcom’s soaring share price is still backed by solid value, or if it is starting to outpace its fundamentals? You are not alone, and today we are putting its valuation under the microscope.</li> <li>Broadcom’s stock has delivered eye-catching returns, climbing 4.4% in the last week, 10.9% in the past month, and an impressive 59.3% year-to-date, with a staggering 121% gain over the past year.</li> <li>Recent headlines have been all about Broadcom’s growing presence in the AI semiconductor space and its high-profile acquisitions. These factors are fueling optimism about long-term growth. These developments have driven renewed attention and may be shifting how investors see the company’s risk and reward profile.</li> <li>Despite the buzz, Broadcom scores a 0/6 on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation checks</a>, meaning it is not undervalued according to any of our standard measures. In the next section, we will explore the different approaches to valuing Broadcom and hint at a smarter way to evaluate whether this stock is truly worth its price tag.</li> </ul> <p>Broadcom scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

This approach aims to capture what Broadcom is truly worth based on its ability to generate cash over time.</p> <p>For Broadcom, current free cash flow stands at $24.8 Billion. Analysts estimate the company’s free cash flow will grow substantially, reaching about $94.1 Billion by 2029. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extrapolates even further, projecting free cash flows to continue increasing over the next decade. While analyst coverage is strong over the next 5 years, estimates past that period are based on broader growth assumptions.</p> <p>Using this method, Broadcom’s intrinsic value per share is estimated at $313.06. Compared to the current share price, this implies the stock is trading at an 18.1% premium, meaning it is overvalued according to the DCF model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Broadcom may be overvalued by 18.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 832 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AVGO Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>AVGO Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Broadcom.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Broadcom Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often considered the gold standard for valuing profitable companies like Broadcom. It links a company’s share price to its earnings per share, offering investors an instant view of how much they are paying for a dollar of Broadcom’s current profits.</p> <p>What counts as a \"fair\" PE ratio depends largely on expectations. If a company is growing quickly or is viewed as lower risk, investors are generally willing to pay a higher PE. In contrast, lower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower PE.</p> <p>Broadcom’s current PE ratio is 92.8x, which is substantially higher than both the semiconductor industry average of 37.6x and the average of its direct peers at 63.8x. While this suggests a premium, Simply Wall St’s proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" model estimates a fair PE for Broadcom would be 63.3x. This Fair Ratio goes beyond basic comparisons by considering Broadcom’s unique growth outlook, profit margins, market capitalization, industry dynamics, and potential risks. It provides a more nuanced benchmark than simply looking at peers or industry averages.</p> <p>Comparing Broadcom’s current PE of 92.8x to its Fair Ratio of 63.3x, the stock appears significantly overvalued by this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:AVGO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:AVGO PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Broadcom Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. In simple terms, a Narrative is your personalized story about a company. It is how you connect what you believe about Broadcom’s future with a financial forecast and a fair value estimate.</p> <p>Rather than relying solely on stock charts or standard ratios, a Narrative helps you clearly lay out your assumptions for things like future revenue, profit margins, and risks, then links those beliefs directly to an estimated fair value. This turns abstract numbers into an actionable story, making valuation much more approachable and intuitive.</p> <p>Millions of investors already use Narratives on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where you can set your own fair value and see how it stacks up against the current price and others’ views. Narratives update automatically as new information, such as earnings or breaking news, comes in. This helps you stay aligned with the latest outlook and make buy or sell decisions confidently.</p> <p>For Broadcom, one investor’s Narrative might forecast robust AI chip demand and successful VMware integration, supporting a fair value above $460 per share. Another investor might see tough competition and execution risks, believing the shares are only worth $218. This highlights the importance of your own research and perspective.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Broadcom? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-avgo/broadcom/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:AVGO Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/26aa8236-810a-4b04-82aa-482568c711e4/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:AVGO Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This method seeks to answer what Anheuser-Busch InBev is truly worth based on the cash it is expected to generate.</p> <p>For Anheuser-Busch InBev, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) stands at $10.9 billion. Analyst estimates project steady growth, reaching $12.3 billion by 2027. Beyond that, additional growth is factored in using long-term extrapolations, with projections climbing to $15.6 billion by 2035. These forecasts combine both the near-term insights from analysts and further growth modeled by Simply Wall St for the later years.</p> <p>Bringing all these cash flow projections together, the DCF model calculates an estimated intrinsic value of $141.78 per share. This is approximately 62.7% higher than the current market price, suggesting the stock is significantly undervalued right now.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Anheuser-Busch InBev is undervalued by 62.7%.

A PE ratio effectively shows how much investors are willing to pay for each euro of earnings. This can be a useful lens for evaluating established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>Interpreting whether a PE ratio is high or low depends on growth expectations and perceived risks. Companies with strong expected growth or low risk typically trade at higher PE ratios, while mature or riskier businesses see lower ratios. It's important to compare a company's PE not just to industry norms but also to consider company-specific dynamics.</p> <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev currently trades on a PE ratio of 19.5x. This is slightly above the broader Beverage industry average of 17.8x, but below its global peer average of 23.0x. To gain further insight, Simply Wall St's proprietary Fair Ratio incorporates factors like earnings growth outlook, size, margins, and risks to estimate what a justified PE for the company should be.</p> <p>According to this Fair Ratio, Anheuser-Busch InBev deserves a PE of 33.4x. Unlike basic comparisons with peers or the sector, this Fair Ratio approach tailors valuation for this specific company by considering not just industry trends but also unique qualities such as its forecasted earnings growth, business risks, profit margins, and market size.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 33.4x to the current multiple of 19.5x, it appears Anheuser-Busch InBev is trading well below its justified value using this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/be/food-beverage-tobacco/ebr-abi/anheuser-busch-inbev-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTBR:ABI PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e9264b30-f5ce-4005-a381-c6f3ee663e60/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTBR:ABI PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Anheuser-Busch InBev Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your investment story, where you combine your view on a company's future with your own assumptions for its revenue, earnings growth, profit margins and more, linking those expectations directly to a fair value estimate.</p> <p>Rather than just looking at a single valuation number, Narratives allow you to anchor your personal outlook—whether optimistic, cautious, or anywhere in between—to a dynamic forecast and see what that means for your buy or sell decisions. Narratives are easy to create and available on Simply Wall St's Community page, empowering millions of investors to shape and share their own projections.</p> <p>What's more, Narratives automatically update when new news or results arrive, so your fair value stays relevant and timely. For example, different investors might build Narratives for Anheuser-Busch InBev ranging from highly confident, expecting €78.81 per share if you forecast strong premiumization and margin expansion, to more cautious, with a €54.84 fair value if you foresee headwinds from consumer shifts or emerging market risks.</p> <p>By creating and tracking your own Narrative, you can instantly compare your Fair Value to today's price and make smarter, ever-adaptive investment decisions backed by your own reasoning.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Anheuser-Busch InBev? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/be/food-beverage-tobacco/ebr-abi/anheuser-busch-inbev-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTBR:ABI Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e9264b30-f5ce-4005-a381-c6f3ee663e60/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTBR:ABI Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Momentum has faded lately, but long-term holders have still enjoyed solid gains.</p> <p>If you’re curious about other opportunities beyond real estate, now is a perfect moment to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But after such swings, is Alexander's undervalued in the current market, or are investors simply right to question its future prospects?

With the last close at $220.93, this figure suggests that the market is pricing in a premium for the business relative to its peers.</p> <p>The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings and is a widely used yardstick for gauging whether a stock is cheap or expensive within its industry. For a real estate investment trust (REIT) like Alexander's, this metric is especially important as market participants often seek stable earnings or distributions.</p> <p>Currently, Alexander's P/E of 30.2x is significantly higher than both the US Retail REITs industry average of 26.1x and the peer group average of 18.4x. Compared to the estimated Fair P/E Ratio of 20.3x, the difference becomes even more apparent, suggesting that the current valuation could be stretched unless substantial growth materializes.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-alx/alexanders/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Alexander's</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 30.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, declining net income growth and a notable discount to the analyst price target could challenge the optimistic case for Alexander's in the coming periods.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-alx/alexanders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Alexander's narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Perspective</h2> <p>While the market’s P/E metric casts Alexander’s shares as expensive, another approach, the SWS DCF model, paints a starker picture.

This suggests analysts expect only modest upside from current levels.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus narrative, this cautious price target reflects an expectation for annual revenue growth of 6.7% over the next three years. It also builds in concerns that profit margins may contract slightly from 25.5% today to 25.2%, while heavy reliance on the shrinking domestic market remains a long-term challenge.\n    <ul> <li>Competitive risks and flattening new mandates, with recent drops of 11.6% and 19% in new sell-side and mid-cap mandates respectively, reinforce worries about future deal flow.</li> <li>Ongoing international expansion and digital initiatives, such as proprietary platforms and AI integration, are cited as stabilizing forces that should support earnings quality even if top-line prospects remain muted.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus is that current results justify only a small premium to today’s price, with market performance likely tracking closer to sector averages than in prior high-growth years.</li> </ul> <p>Consensus expects stable returns, but potential surprises on growth or margin expansion could quickly shift the outlook. See the full consensus narrative on what may move the stock next. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/73smb8sl-expanding-japanese-manda-networks-and-ai-will-fuel-future-opportunities-h0dq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Nihon M&amp;A Center Holdings Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Margins Show Resilience Despite Cost Pressures</h2> <ul> <li>The latest net profit margin stands at 26.3%, up from last year’s 24.7%, bucking the analysts' forecast for a slight margin decline over the medium term.</li> <li>The consensus narrative highlights that efficiency gains from digital platform adoption (including Salesforce and DX initiatives) are helping the company maintain and even expand margins, even as analysts had expected minor margin compression.\n    <ul> <li>This technology-driven productivity, combined with a broader suite of consulting services, supports stronger conversion rates and client retention than many smaller rivals can achieve.</li> <li>Strong brand reputation and expanded regional networks are also underpinning pricing power, lessening the impact from slowdowns in new mandate growth and rising personnel costs.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Above Industry But Near Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The price-to-earnings ratio for Nihon M&amp;A Center Holdings remains elevated at 21.2x, above the industry average of 16.2x, yet the stock is trading near its DCF fair value of 752.37.</li> <li>As the analysts' consensus narrative notes, this premium multiple is justified if the company can deliver on new revenue streams and efficiency gains from diversification and digital transformation. However, reliance on challenging domestic trends means outperformance is not guaranteed.\n    <ul> <li>If actual earnings match the consensus 2028 projection of ¥13.9 billion and margins hold steady, valuation could remain supported. Yet, a slip in deal pipeline or failure to internationalize meaningfully would challenge current expectations.</li> <li>With the share price now at 726.60, just under both the consensus target and intrinsic fair value, there may be limited room for rerating without a positive catalyst.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/73smb8sl-expanding-japanese-manda-networks-and-ai-will-fuel-future-opportunities-h0dq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Nihon M&amp;A Center Holdings on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own take on these results?

This positions BLX to grow fee-based revenues over the coming 18 months.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, these moves should help expand operational efficiency and improve asset mix quality. Critics note, however, that growth in fee revenues may slow if the extraordinary $ millions generated by one-off syndication deals, such as the Staatsolie transaction, are not repeated in future quarters.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that ongoing expansion in structured, higher-margin activities is set to raise the baseline for earnings and lower cyclicality over time.</li> <li>Reliance on large, infrequent transactions is also flagged as a risk for sustaining income at currently elevated margins.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative notes that these earnings catalysts present a balanced opportunity, inviting investors to judge if the upcoming fee and margin shifts really support the current market optimism.\n    <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/c4ac87fr-digital-trade-finance-platform-will-unlock-latin-american-opportunities-dnkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior S. A Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Deposit Funding Now Covers 62% of Needs</h2> <ul> <li>Deposit-based funding now represents 62% of BLX’s total, helping reduce the cost of funds and improve resilience in net interest margins compared to competitors that remain reliant on more volatile wholesale sources.</li> <li>Consensus narrative underscores that this prudent shift supports stronger asset quality and earnings stability. However, it warns that high regional sovereign and quasi-sovereign exposures still introduce risks if Latin American credit shocks or cyclical downturns materialize.\n    <ul> <li>Strong asset quality, with near-zero non-performing loans and high reserve coverage, reinforces the bank’s position to capture growth opportunities while limiting margin downside.</li> <li>Ongoing exposure to state-linked entities and regional macro volatility remains a material factor for future profitability swings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Discounted Valuation Even With Slowing Growth</h2> <ul> <li>BLX’s P/E ratio of 7.1x remains well below both the US diversified financial industry (14.8x) and peer average (50x). The current share price of $43.01 also continues to trade beneath both the analyst price target ($55.50) and DCF fair value ($66.69).</li> <li>Per the consensus narrative, this deep discount reflects solid value and high-quality earnings. However, since forward revenue and earnings growth are both forecast to decelerate below US market averages (7.5% and 9.3% per year, respectively), the market is signaling some caution about longer-term business momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that analysts see only 1.6% upside from the current share price to their price target, reinforcing the idea that BLX is already fairly priced in the short term.</li> <li>Bears argue that the upside may remain limited unless future profit growth or the bank’s fee platform meaningfully exceeds these forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/c4ac87fr-digital-trade-finance-platform-will-unlock-latin-american-opportunities-dnkb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior S.

These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p><p> To get a sense of who is truly in control of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PRUDENT</a>), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business.  And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 58% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> As market cap fell to ₹106b last week, insiders would have faced the highest losses than any other shareholder groups of the company.    </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudent Advisory Services. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Prudent Advisory Services </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761972942585\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Ownership Breakdown November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudent Advisory Services?</h2><p> Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. </p> <p> Prudent Advisory Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudent Advisory Services' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761972943724\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Prudent Advisory Services is not owned by hedge funds.      From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Sanjay Shah (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 55% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.      Additionally, the company's CEO Shirish Patel directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.   </p><p> While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Prudent Advisory Services</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. </p><p> Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. </p> <p> Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company.   Given it has a market cap of ₹106b, that means insiders have a whopping ₹61b worth of shares in their own names.  It is good to see this level of investment. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check here to see if those insiders have been selling any of their shares. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.   While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. </p> <h2>Private Company Ownership</h2><p> Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 6.7%, of the company's shares.   It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. </p> <p> I always like to check for a <strong>history of revenue growth</strong>. You can too, by accessing this free chart of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">historic revenue and earnings in this <strong>detailed graph</strong></a>. </p> <p> Ultimately <strong>the future is most important</strong>.

The latest set of results, showing a small net loss in the most recent quarter but a dramatic surge in net income over the nine months, doesn’t fundamentally change this long-term story. The regular and special dividends, combined with a debt-free balance sheet, still signal strong capital management. However, the pullback in share repurchases this quarter and the market’s recent price drop may point to some shifting priorities or softer near-term demand for data licensing. While the headline profit swing and continued capital return matter, they don’t seem material enough to offset ongoing risks like volatility in seismic data sales linked to energy sector uncertainty.\n<br/><br/> Conversely, short-term swings in licensing revenues can change the outlook quickly for shareholders.\n</p> Despite retreating, Pulse Seismic's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how much</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/32be1ff6-af93-4e90-ab28-50d059107da5/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirteen individual fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from C$1.89 to a very large C$509,435.53 per share.

After a year of improving profitability and strong revenue growth, the company’s headline third-quarter revenue surge and positive mazdutide Phase 3 data have injected real momentum into its short-term outlook. These confirm that Innovent’s expansion beyond oncology, especially in the high-growth metabolic disease segment, may now be a key catalyst, and the faster-than-market revenue growth forecast could become more credible. However, bigger rewards come with complex risks, for Innovent, the steep price-to-earnings ratio and relatively low return on equity stand out, as does the risk of execution as new therapies reach a commercial inflection. The Takeda partnership may reduce some development risks but global execution remains untested. \nOn the flipside, keep an eye on market expectations around profitability as valuation pressure can shift quickly.</p> Innovent Biologics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 16%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/hkg-1801/innovent-biologics-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/pharmaceuticals-biotech/hkg-1801/innovent-biologics-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:1801 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/861d28ed-8790-450c-b7ce-2b5bca5b0e07/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:1801 Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s three fair value estimates for Innovent Biologics range widely from HK$36.45 up to HK$109.21 per share.

The appointment of Karthik Suri as Chief Product and Corporate Strategy Officer is a meaningful move, but any impact on short-term catalysts, particularly stabilizing customer retention among top accounts, may not be immediately visible.

These products are designed to boost operational efficiency and customer engagement, tying back to Sprinklr’s main growth drivers and offering a pathway to strengthen customer relationships.
