You're in the right place to find out what is really driving its value.</li> <li>After a solid 83.8% gain over the last five years, the stock has cooled off recently, down 1.4% in the past week and 10.5% year-to-date. This illustrates how quickly sentiment and risk perceptions can shift.</li> <li>Recent headlines about shifting global energy demand and volatility in commodity prices have fueled both optimism and caution around oil and gas producers. Coterra has been especially visible as analysts weigh in on its capital spending strategy and the broader outlook for natural gas markets.</li> <li>On our proprietary valuation checks, Coterra Energy scores an impressive <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>, suggesting strong all-round value.

This approach helps investors gauge whether a stock's market price reflects its potential to generate cash over time.\n</p> <p> For Coterra Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow stands at $1.50 Billion. Analysts provide detailed cash flow forecasts out to 2029, with projected Free Cash Flow rising to $2.60 Billion by that year. Over the full 10-year model horizon, which includes both analyst forecasts and methodical extrapolations, the company’s cash flows remain strong and show healthy growth. The pace moderates in later years as projections move beyond analyst coverage and rely on broader industry assumptions.\n</p> <p> According to this DCF model, Coterra’s intrinsic value is estimated at $65.90 per share. This implies the stock is trading at a 64.5% discount to its calculated fair value, suggesting that it is significantly undervalued based on projected future cash generation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coterra Energy is undervalued by 64.5%.

It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. Since earnings influence long-term shareholder returns, the PE ratio is especially useful for comparing companies within the same industry or across the broader market.\n</p> <p> A company's fair PE ratio depends on more than just profits. Growth expectations play a significant role; faster-growing companies often command higher multiples, while uncertainties or heightened risk can result in lower valuations. Stable profit margins and larger market capitalizations also tend to increase what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE.\n</p> <p> Coterra Energy is currently trading on an 11.33x PE multiple. This is below the Oil and Gas industry average of 12.59x and also comfortably under the peer group average of 16.72x. To provide a fuller picture, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" for each company that blends key factors such as expected earnings growth, industry trends, company size, profit margins, and risk. For Coterra, the Fair Ratio is 18.33x, indicating the stock is valued well below what would be expected given its underlying fundamentals.\n</p> <p> By using the Fair Ratio, investors gain a more tailored sense of value rather than relying solely on industry or peer averages. This approach adjusts for the nuances that make Coterra unique, capturing both upside growth and risk factors in a way that broad benchmarks cannot.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Coterra Energy Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a practical way for investors to tie together their view of a company's story, like Coterra's growth drivers or risks, with their forecasts for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins. This approach ultimately helps determine what they believe to be a fair value for the stock.\n</p> <p> Narratives connect the dots between \"what's happening at the company\" and \"what the numbers mean,\" allowing you to set your own assumptions and see the financial impact. On the Simply Wall St platform, Narratives are easy for anyone to create or follow within the Community page, empowering millions of users to document their perspectives and update them as news or earnings releases come in.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly see if your Fair Value signals a buy, hold, or sell opportunity compared to today's Price. Because these are updated dynamically with new information, they help you make timely, better-informed decisions.\n</p> <p> For example, one investor might build a Narrative assuming robust LNG-driven revenue growth and land at a Fair Value of $40. Another investor, more cautious on gas prices and regulatory risks, may set their Fair Value closer to $25. This demonstrates how your story shapes your strategy.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coterra Energy? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The share price dropped 11.7% over the past month and is down 13.2% year-to-date. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at -9.2%, long-term holders are still up a robust 64% over five years, showing the value of patience through the bank’s cycles. Ongoing executive transitions and new branch openings may offer fresh catalysts, but for now, investor sentiment remains cautious given recent earnings volatility.</p> <p>If this volatility has you curious about other opportunities, now’s the perfect moment to expand your watchlist and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>With shares now trading at a substantial discount to analyst targets, the crucial question is whether Dime Community Bancshares is undervalued after recent setbacks or if the market is simply reflecting realistic expectations for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 26.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Dime Community Bancshares closing at $26.34 and the most popular narrative setting fair value over $36, this large gap has fueled fresh optimism among narrative followers.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension.

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.

That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!

Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

            "title": "What Do Recent Partnerships Mean for Harmonic’s True Value in 2025?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Thinking of investing in Harmonic but want to know if you're getting a good deal? Let's break down what might make this stock a value play or not.</li> <li>The stock has shown recent signs of life, rising 2.4% in the last week and 4.6% over the past month. However, it is still down 18.6% year-to-date.</li> <li>Much of the recent price movement comes after industry-wide optimism about streaming technology and a series of partnerships announced by Harmonic. These developments have helped boost sentiment, and investors are taking notice, hoping they could translate into longer-term growth and potentially shift the company's risk profile.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Harmonic scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3/6</a>. This means it appears undervalued in half of the main metrics we review. We'll get into the details of how these scores are calculated in a moment, but stay with us for a more insightful way to judge true value coming up at the end of this article.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_industry_underperformer\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out why Harmonic's -4.0% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Harmonic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model works by projecting a company’s future free cash flows and then discounting them back to today’s value to estimate what the business is intrinsically worth. This method gives a sense of what the stock should be worth based on its future earnings potential, not just its current profits.</p> <p>For Harmonic, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $119.2 Million, highlighting a healthy level of cash generation. According to analyst estimates and model extrapolation, free cash flow in 2026 is projected to be $69.7 Million, with a decline over the next decade to around $35 Million by 2035. While analysts typically offer cash flow projections only a few years out, the model extends these estimates to provide a longer-term view.</p> <p>Based on these projections, Harmonic’s intrinsic value is calculated as $5.15 per share. With the current share price at more than double this figure, the DCF model indicates the stock is about 107% overvalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Harmonic may be overvalued by 107.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 839 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Harmonic.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Harmonic Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies like Harmonic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used methods for stock valuation. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, making it a practical gauge of market sentiment and perceived potential.</p> <p>Typically, a company with strong growth prospects or lower risk will command a higher PE ratio, while those facing uncertainty warrant a lower multiple. Factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends all play crucial roles in shaping what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE for a particular business.</p> <p>At present, Harmonic trades at a PE ratio of 17.6x. This is significantly below both the peer average of 28.9x and the communications industry average of 33.5x. This suggests the market is pricing in more caution or slower growth for Harmonic. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio model, which uniquely considers the company’s growth forecasts, profit margins, risks, industry, and market cap, calculates Harmonic’s fair PE at 22.9x. Unlike simply comparing to peers or industry, the Fair Ratio fine-tunes expectations to the individual company traits that matter most to investors.</p> <p>With its current PE ratio of 17.6x compared to a Fair Ratio of 22.9x, Harmonic’s stock appears undervalued according to this approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Harmonic Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, approachable tool that lets you create your own story about a company and connect it directly to a set of financial forecasts, such as fair value, future revenue, and margins, based on your own expectations or assumptions.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to review, refine, and share their perspectives, linking Harmonic’s latest business developments or competitive strengths directly to customized valuation models. This makes it easy to decide whether to buy or sell when comparing fair value against the current share price.</p> <p>Narratives stay dynamic, automatically updating when new news emerges, earnings are reported, or company guidance changes, so your investment view never goes out of date.</p> <p>For example, one Harmonic Narrative might reflect a bullish view, projecting a fair value of $12.5 per share based on expanding broadband demand and recurring SaaS revenue. A more cautious Narrative might cite technology risks or customer concentration for a fair value of just $7.0 per share. Narratives let you choose which outlook best fits your beliefs and investment approach.</p> <p>For Harmonic, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Harmonic Narratives:</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/hlit-market-outlook?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Harmonic Bull Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $12.10</p> <p>Current Price is 12% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 5.0%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights Harmonic’s strong positioning in the broadband and video delivery sectors, with Tier-1 telecom partnerships and a low price-to-earnings ratio compared to peers.</li> <li>There are significant tailwinds from broadband expansion, 5G deployment, and recurring SaaS/cloud revenue streams supporting multi-year growth.</li> <li>Cautions on execution risks and reliance on a few large customers, but notes the stock may offer a compelling mix of value and growth for a mid-term investment horizon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/njadqcqc-lifting-industry-headwinds-will-support-broader-demand-and-market-momentum-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Harmonic Bear Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $10.50</p> <p>Current Price is 1.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 0.3%</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes the risks from customer concentration, rapid technology changes, and increased competition, which may pressure revenues and margins.</li> <li>Harmonic’s shift to higher-margin SaaS and cloud products could drive future earnings, but the transition may introduce near-term volatility and execution challenges.</li> <li>Sees the current share price as close to fair value, with modest upside, and suggests investors closely monitor customer trends and industry dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Harmonic? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
