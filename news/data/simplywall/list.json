The company also announced an improved dividend outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for OBIC Business Consultants.</a></p> <p>OBIC Business Consultants has picked up strong momentum this year, with a year-to-date share price return of 29.44% and a 1-year total shareholder return of 29.92%. Recent profit growth and an improved dividend forecast have added to the positive sentiment. This suggests investors are rewarding both operational strength and growing income potential.</p> <p>If you’re interested in broadening your search beyond a single software name, now is a great time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>With OBIC Business Consultants delivering robust profit growth and a strong dividend outlook, the question now is whether investors are looking at an undervalued opportunity or if market optimism has already factored in future gains.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 40.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>OBIC Business Consultants currently trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 40.4x, which reflects a premium relative to its closest peers. The last closing price was ¥8,750.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings multiple measures how much investors are willing to pay per yen of company earnings. In software and technology sectors, higher PE ratios sometimes correspond with strong growth prospects, reliable profits, or perceived quality.</p> <p>OBIC Business Consultants is considered good value compared to its peer average PE of 58.8x, suggesting the market recognizes upside relative to other software firms. However, compared to the broader Japanese software industry average of just 21.1x, this multiple is steep. Against our estimated fair PE ratio of 27.6x, the current valuation also appears stretched. This means the market is pricing in significant optimism and future earnings growth that may be above historic norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for OBIC Business Consultants</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 40.4x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower sector growth or a shift in market sentiment could dampen expectations and put pressure on OBIC Business Consultants' premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this OBIC Business Consultants narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model</h2> <p>While the PE ratio points to a stretched valuation, the SWS DCF model offers a sharply different perspective.

The company’s full-year outlook is now under review, raising questions about the path forward for this established name in apparel.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Wacoal Holdings.</a></p> <p>Wacoal’s shares have seen modest gains over the past year, with a 2% year-to-date share price return. The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

The renewed optimism about a US-China trade truce could ease Levi's cost pressures, potentially becoming the most important short-term catalyst, while ongoing exposure to tariff fluctuations and slow progress in China remain significant risks. The overall impact of the recent news on these factors appears material for near-term profitability and international momentum.</p> <p>One recent announcement that stands out is the launch of the Blue Tab collection, aiming to reinforce Levi's product diversity by appealing both to premium shoppers and value seekers. This move aligns closely with international growth catalysts, particularly if tariff relief improves supply chain flexibility and supports global demand for core denim offerings.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple. Such a wide premium suggests investors should take a hard look at the underlying growth assumptions that are driving KRMN's lofty valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Karman Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Preferred multiple of price-to-sales 28.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, signs of overvaluation and the stock trading below analyst price targets could trigger a sentiment shift if growth expectations are not fully realized.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Karman Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests Shares Are Overvalued</h2> <p>Looking at Karman Holdings through the lens of our SWS DCF model creates a starkly different picture.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics.  Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Having said that, from a first glance at <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BVMF:AMBP3</a>) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso.

The company's dedication to superior service and disciplined yield management supports long-term market share gains and operational density improvements, which could enhance operating leverage and improve earnings.”\n</p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/099pxlb0-capacity-investments-and-expense-management-will-secure-future-market-share-55ar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p> Want to know the real financial engine behind this bullish estimate?
