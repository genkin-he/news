They show that Fortis’s growing regulated asset base is still converting into higher earnings, which supports the current dividend level and the company’s emphasis on stable, regulated returns as a core part of its investment story.</p> <p>Yet beneath this long dividend streak, investors still need to be aware of rising debt costs and regulatory pushback that could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/utilities/tsx-fts/fortis-shares/nykvhb33-analysts-lift-fortis-price-target-amid-positive-profit-margin-outlook-and-key-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Fortis (it's free!)</a></p><p>Fortis' narrative projects CA$13.8 billion revenue and CA$2.1 billion earnings by 2028.

It is often used for early stage or loss making businesses where earnings are not yet meaningful. For a clinical stage biotech with no revenue and ongoing losses, a higher P/B can reflect how investors are weighing the company’s pipeline, expected future cash flows, and funding needs against its current balance sheet.</p> <p>Here, Cogent’s 11.4x P/B is described as good value relative to its peer average of 19.1x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock at a discount to similar names focused on comparable areas. At the same time, the same 11.4x is described as expensive versus the wider US biotechs industry average of 2.7x, meaning investors are currently assigning a much richer valuation than they are to the sector overall.</p> <p>Result: Price-to-Book of 11.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh the pipeline and valuation against clinical trial uncertainty and the ongoing net loss of US$328.937 million with no current revenue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Cogent Biosciences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If you are weighing the mix of strong past returns and a significant net loss, take a moment to review the key data and form your own view, including the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 3 important warning signs</a> that highlights what the market currently sees on both the risk and reward side.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If Cogent has you thinking more broadly about your portfolio, do not stop here, there are other stocks and themes worth putting on your radar right now.</p> <ul> <li>Target potential mispricings by scanning companies that look attractively valued on key fundamentals using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> before the crowd turns its attention to them.</li> <li>Strengthen your income stream by reviewing companies with higher yields and resilient payouts through the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15 dividend fortresses</a> so you are not relying on capital gains alone.</li> <li>Prioritise resilience by focusing on businesses with robust finances and consistent metrics via the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_solid_balance_sheet\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solid balance sheet and fundamentals stocks screener (39 results)</a>, rather than leaving your capital tied to weaker balance sheets.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over a longer stretch, a 26.2% 1 year total shareholder return and 53.0% 5 year total shareholder return indicate that investors who stayed invested through recent capital raises and earnings movements have, so far, been rewarded.</p> <p>If the AI linked power demand story has you looking beyond a single utility, this could be a good moment to scan <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting list of grid focused names to research next.</p> <p>So with Portland General Electric raising about US$480 million, reporting US$306 million in net income, and leaning into AI related demand, is the current share price offering value or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.1% Overvalued</h2> <p>Portland General Electric’s most followed narrative puts fair value at about $52.32, slightly below the last close of $53.96, which frames the current AI and PacifiCorp excitement as already largely reflected in the price.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Robust and sustained demand growth from industrial and data center customers is accelerating system wide electricity usage, underpinned by Oregon's strong technology sector and regional electrification objectives; this is expected to solidly grow PGE's revenue base and support long term earnings expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing transition to clean energy including major renewable procurements (2023 and 2025 RFPs) and battery storage integration position PGE to capitalize on declining renewable costs and federal tax credits, which should drive rate base growth, lower operational costs, and support future margin improvement.</em></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/dlz3g6mc-analyst-commentary-highlights-raised-targets-and-battery-storage-gains-for-portland-general-electric\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how steady demand, cleaner generation, and a higher future earnings multiple all fit into one price tag?

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $2.78b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest free cash flow reaching around $3.70b by 2030, with a path that moves through projected figures such as $2.81b in 2026 and $3.46b in 2029, all in US dollars.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $462.30 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $307, this implies a 33.6% discount, which indicates that the shares screen as undervalued under this particular set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Public Storage is undervalued by 33.6%.

It captures both what the business is earning today and how the market is weighing its prospects and risks.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more cautious multiple. The question is not whether a P/E is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Public Storage currently trades on a P/E of 33.99x. That sits above the Specialized REITs industry average of 15.86x, and below the peer group average of 41.55x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Public Storage is 34.36x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given the company’s earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it tries to account for the specific mix of growth, risk and profitability that is unique to Public Storage.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 33.99x very close to the Fair Ratio of 34.36x, the shares screen as ABOUT RIGHT on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Public Storage into a clear story that links its business outlook to a financial forecast, then to a fair value, all inside Simply Wall St’s Community page where millions of investors share their assumptions. You can compare a more upbeat view that leans toward the higher US$350 price target with a more cautious view closer to US$287, see how each Narrative’s fair value stacks up against today’s share price, and watch those fair values update automatically as new earnings, guidance or news come through. This can give you a practical framework to decide whether the current price lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Public Storage? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/PSA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The upgraded FY26 profit and ARR guidance reinforces that storyline and likely strengthens the near term catalyst around recurring revenue growth. At the same time, it does not remove the key risk that expectations embedded in the current valuation could still prove demanding if growth slows.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the upgraded FY26 guidance is the most directly relevant. Lifting profit before tax growth expectations to 18% to 20% and ARR growth to 16% to 18% gives more concrete shape to the SaaS+ thesis that many investors are watching closely. Combined with continuing board refreshment and Philip Davis’ initial on market share purchase, it supports a narrative of management leaning into the recurring revenue opportunity while the market reassesses shorter term share price weakness.</p> <p>But against this stronger guidance, investors should still weigh the risk that Technology One’s premium valuation could come under pressure if revenue growth in key markets were to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/software/asx-tne/technology-one-shares/nfnd5wy8-overvaluation-will-encounter-regulatory-headwinds-and-saas-resilience-hxrs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Technology One (it's free!)</a></p><p>Technology One’s narrative projects A$841.0 million revenue and A$224.2 million earnings by 2028.

The new FulcrumAir partnership fits neatly into this narrative: it reinforces PLP’s position in automated installation systems, but is unlikely to be a near term financial needle-mover compared with more immediate catalysts like order flow from utilities, margin trends after a softer Q3 2025, and how the business justifies its current premium P/E multiple. Where it might matter more is on the risk side: deeper integration into robotics raises execution and R&amp;D risk, but also gives PLP another way to defend its niche if competition in more traditional products intensifies.</p> But there is one operational and valuation risk in particular that investors should not ignore.\n\nPreformed Line Products' share price has been on the slide but might be dropping deeper into value territory. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out whether it's a bargain at this price</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-plpc/preformed-line-products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92e40fc7-c157-465d-983d-ab7b75e39451/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLPC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates span roughly US$77 to US$285, showing just how far apart private investors can be on PLP.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Cloudflare launched what it calls the first complete Secure Access Service Edge platform with post-quantum encryption across its services.</li> <li>The company also announced a cybersecurity partnership with Mastercard aimed at protecting critical infrastructure and small businesses with real time, risk driven defenses.</li> </ul> <p>Cloudflare, trading on the NYSE under ticker NYSE:NET, sits at the intersection of networking and security. This move pushes more of its product stack into the security spotlight. The stock last closed at $172.19, with a 1 year return of 18.5% and a 3 year return of 179.6%. These figures put the announcements into focus for investors following the company's evolution. The 5 year return of 156.9% offers a longer lens on how the market has treated Cloudflare's role in internet infrastructure.</p> <p>In the near term, investors watching NYSE:NET are likely to focus on how post-quantum encryption and the Mastercard partnership translate into product adoption and customer stickiness. As quantum computing risk and attacks on payment systems and small businesses receive more attention, Cloudflare's positioning around end to end cryptography and real time threat screening may become a more central part of how the company is evaluated.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-net/cloudflare/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

The 2025 10-K reinforces that story: management is leaning into a diversified deposit base, higher-yielding securities and a thicker capital cushion, with CET1 at 14.10% and shareholders’ equity up 14.4%. That is reassuring given recent volatility in bank funding costs, and it supports the near-term dividend story after the latest increase to US$0.24 per share. At the same time, the filing also puts a spotlight on the weak revenue growth, a 3.1% net interest margin and a greater tilt toward variable-rate loans, which keeps interest rate risk, funding competition and the stock’s above-peer valuation firmly on the list of near-term swing factors.</p> However, investors should not ignore how interest rate sensitivity could pressure margins if conditions shift.\n\nDespite retreating, First Bancorp's shares might still be trading 41% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/18aaef02-f6ad-4640-bf94-5195b7c7866f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$54 to almost US$97 per share, underlining how far apart individual views can be.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today’s terms.</p> <p>For USA Rare Earth, the latest twelve month free cash flow (FCF) is a loss of $39.02 million. Analyst and model projections see FCF running through a mix of negative and positive years, with a projected $735.00 million in FCF for 2030. Beyond the explicit analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends the cash flow path using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.</p> <p>Combining all of those discounted cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $203.77 per share. When this is compared with the recent share price of $18.90, the model suggests the stock trades at a 90.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates substantial potential upside based solely on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests USA Rare Earth is undervalued by 90.7%.

It is especially common in capital intensive sectors where tangible assets matter.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/B, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower multiple. That is why it helps to look at a company’s P/B next to its sector and peers, rather than in isolation.</p> <p>USA Rare Earth currently trades on a P/B ratio of 68.02x. This sits well above the Metals and Mining industry average P/B of 2.66x and above the peer group average of 8.63x. Simply Wall St also uses a “Fair Ratio”, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/B should be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s risks, its industry and its market cap. This Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored anchor than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for those company specific features.</p> <p>On this framework, USA Rare Earth’s current P/B of 68.02x is higher than the Fair Ratio assessment would typically support.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins and fair value.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit in the Community page and let you connect USA Rare Earth’s business story to a clear financial forecast, then to a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to help you decide whether it feels more like a buy, a hold or a sell for you.</p> <p>Because Narratives on the platform are updated as new information comes in, such as news or earnings, they stay aligned with the latest data without you needing to rebuild your thinking from scratch every time something changes.</p> <p>For example, one Narrative on USA Rare Earth might see a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future cash flows and margins. Another Narrative might point to a much lower fair value because its author expects more modest revenue and profitability.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for USA Rare Earth? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/USAR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
