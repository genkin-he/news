Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have declined at an average annual rate of 8.8%. The stock trades at $11.07, giving it a Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 70.7x, which is well above the peer average of 12x and the US Banks industry average of 11x.

This method gives a sense of what the stock should be worth based on its future earnings potential, not just its current profits.</p> <p>For Harmonic, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $119.2 Million, highlighting a healthy level of cash generation. According to analyst estimates and model extrapolation, free cash flow in 2026 is projected to be $69.7 Million, with a decline over the next decade to around $35 Million by 2035. While analysts typically offer cash flow projections only a few years out, the model extends these estimates to provide a longer-term view.</p> <p>Based on these projections, Harmonic’s intrinsic value is calculated as $5.15 per share. With the current share price at more than double this figure, the DCF model indicates the stock is about 107% overvalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Harmonic may be overvalued by 107.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 839 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Harmonic.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Harmonic Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies like Harmonic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used methods for stock valuation. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, making it a practical gauge of market sentiment and perceived potential.</p> <p>Typically, a company with strong growth prospects or lower risk will command a higher PE ratio, while those facing uncertainty warrant a lower multiple. Factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends all play crucial roles in shaping what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE for a particular business.</p> <p>At present, Harmonic trades at a PE ratio of 17.6x. This is significantly below both the peer average of 28.9x and the communications industry average of 33.5x. This suggests the market is pricing in more caution or slower growth for Harmonic. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio model, which uniquely considers the company’s growth forecasts, profit margins, risks, industry, and market cap, calculates Harmonic’s fair PE at 22.9x. Unlike simply comparing to peers or industry, the Fair Ratio fine-tunes expectations to the individual company traits that matter most to investors.</p> <p>With its current PE ratio of 17.6x compared to a Fair Ratio of 22.9x, Harmonic’s stock appears undervalued according to this approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Harmonic Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, approachable tool that lets you create your own story about a company and connect it directly to a set of financial forecasts, such as fair value, future revenue, and margins, based on your own expectations or assumptions.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to review, refine, and share their perspectives, linking Harmonic’s latest business developments or competitive strengths directly to customized valuation models. This makes it easy to decide whether to buy or sell when comparing fair value against the current share price.</p> <p>Narratives stay dynamic, automatically updating when new news emerges, earnings are reported, or company guidance changes, so your investment view never goes out of date.</p> <p>For example, one Harmonic Narrative might reflect a bullish view, projecting a fair value of $12.5 per share based on expanding broadband demand and recurring SaaS revenue. A more cautious Narrative might cite technology risks or customer concentration for a fair value of just $7.0 per share. Narratives let you choose which outlook best fits your beliefs and investment approach.</p> <p>For Harmonic, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Harmonic Narratives:</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/hlit-market-outlook?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Harmonic Bull Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $12.10</p> <p>Current Price is 12% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 5.0%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights Harmonic’s strong positioning in the broadband and video delivery sectors, with Tier-1 telecom partnerships and a low price-to-earnings ratio compared to peers.</li> <li>There are significant tailwinds from broadband expansion, 5G deployment, and recurring SaaS/cloud revenue streams supporting multi-year growth.</li> <li>Cautions on execution risks and reliance on a few large customers, but notes the stock may offer a compelling mix of value and growth for a mid-term investment horizon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/njadqcqc-lifting-industry-headwinds-will-support-broader-demand-and-market-momentum-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Harmonic Bear Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $10.50</p> <p>Current Price is 1.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 0.3%</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes the risks from customer concentration, rapid technology changes, and increased competition, which may pressure revenues and margins.</li> <li>Harmonic’s shift to higher-margin SaaS and cloud products could drive future earnings, but the transition may introduce near-term volatility and execution challenges.</li> <li>Sees the current share price as close to fair value, with modest upside, and suggests investors closely monitor customer trends and industry dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Harmonic? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This move often leads to more investor focus as index-tracking funds rebalance their portfolios to reflect the change.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for George Weston.</a></p> <p>George Weston’s inclusion in the S&amp;P/TSX Preferred Share Index has drawn fresh attention from investors, likely contributing to its momentum this year. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 15.7%, the recent 1-day share price gain of 0.9% hints at renewed optimism after a modest pullback. Over the past five years, the company has delivered a remarkable 183% total return, showing strong long-term value creation even as near-term price swings reflect shifting risk perceptions.</p> <p>If the index move has you wondering what else is on the rise, this is a smart moment to expand your view and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>After a strong run and a fresh boost from its index inclusion, is George Weston still undervalued, or has the market already priced in all the company’s future growth?

With the last close at CA$83.99, investors are paying a premium compared to the broader consumer retailing sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. For a company like George Weston in the consumer retailing space, this metric indicates investor expectations for future profit growth and stability.</p> <p>At 31.6x, George Weston is valued significantly higher than both its North American and peer group averages of 20x. This premium suggests the market is expecting the company to deliver strong earnings growth or stability. However, according to fair value analysis, the justified level would be closer to 23.9x, which implies the current valuation could be considered high if those expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for George Weston</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 31.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower revenue growth or an unexpected dip in net income could quickly change investor sentiment and challenge the current valuation premium.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this George Weston narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Our DCF Model Suggests Upside</h2> <p>While George Weston's current share price looks expensive compared to earnings-based metrics, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins. Achieving this may prove challenging without clear pipeline successes.</li> <li>Investors may face a value-versus-quality decision, with an appealing entry price tempered by skepticism regarding future growth and profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bristol-myers-squibb-bmy-undervalued-opportunity-or-value-trap-a-deep-dive-into-2024-earnings-and-fair-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bristol-Myers Squibb on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a unique take on the figures?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.
