            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>OneStream (OS) has just released a new study spotlighting how CFOs are becoming central to driving organizational AI strategies. The report illustrates growing expectations for AI investment, yet points to lingering challenges around realizing value at scale.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-os/onestream\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for OneStream.</a></p> <p>Over the past year, OneStream’s 1-year total shareholder return has fallen 40.6 percent, reflecting ongoing investor caution even as annual revenue grows and interest in enterprise AI keeps building. Despite upbeat sentiment around the company's innovation, the 7-day share price return was positive. However, year-to-date movement and the 90-day share price return both indicate that momentum is still fading.</p> <p>If OneStream’s latest AI push has you thinking bigger, it may be the perfect time to broaden your investing search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Given OneStream’s expanding AI ambitions and current discounts to analyst price targets, should investors view recent share declines as an undervaluation?

This sets the table for a deeper look into the justifications behind an optimistic view on future growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing large-scale digital transformation across industries, with CFOs increasingly seeking unified platforms to replace legacy financial systems, strongly positions OneStream to capture expanding market share, supporting sustained subscription revenue and new customer growth. Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts. This is positioning OneStream's cloud-native Intelligent Finance Platform for higher recurring and ratable revenues and contributing to predictable top-line expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jcg9s894-digital-transformation-and-cloud-adoption-will-fuel-market-opportunities-czbv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know what’s fueling such a big fair value gap? The narrative is anchored on bold projections about international expansion and sticky recurring revenues.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development. This initiative is closely linked to iFAST’s recurring revenue ambitions and operational leverage, as onboarding moves toward completion. Efficient execution here could support ongoing profit and margin improvements, but the risk lies in managing rising expenses without delay.\n</p> <p> However, it’s important to remember that not all drivers of growth are within management control, particularly if...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/sg/diversified-financials/sgx-aiy/ifast-shares/jg59binl-digital-banking-and-ai-integration-will-expand-global-reach-kacr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on iFAST (it's free!)</a></p><p>iFAST's narrative projects SGD716.4 million revenue and SGD163.0 million earnings by 2028.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso. Given its expertise and recent disciplined CapEx positioning, this could drive future revenue growth as delayed customer investment resumes, especially with policy and economic clarity.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/810soabx-clean-fuel-demand-and-semiconductor-expansion-will-transform-global-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>What are the bold assumptions driving this valuation?

The company currently trades at 22.4 times earnings, which is higher than the peer average of 14.5 times and the industry’s 13.2 times.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions could be an undervalued gem or if the recent hype has stretched its price? You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The Q3 2025 earnings report, showing a sharp jump to profitability and upgraded revenue guidance, further strengthens confidence in top-line momentum, though it does not entirely mitigate the heavy revenue concentration risk tied to the TTR franchise or rising gross-to-net rebate pressures. The most important short-term catalyst remains accelerating AMVUTTRA uptake, while deepening payor dynamics and future gross margin compression continue to represent the most significant risks for shareholders.\n</p> <p> Among the recent announcements, the raised full-year revenue guidance stands out as most relevant, directly reflecting expanding demand for Alnylam products and greater near-term confidence following the strong Q3 surprise. This upgraded forecast also offers context to current catalysts, as it is contingent on maintaining impressive commercial execution in both established and new markets, crucial for translating high sales into sustained profitability.\nContrast this with anticipated gross margin declines which investors should be aware of, especially as royalty obligations on blockbuster products increase...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-alny/alnylam-pharmaceuticals/dh7qnju9-cardiomyopathy-launches-and-pipeline-expansion-will-sustain-momentum-into-2025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (it's free!)</a></p><p>Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' narrative projects $7.0 billion revenue and $1.9 billion earnings by 2028.

The recent shipment of B1 QSE-5 samples, featuring the Cobra separator process, marks a concrete milestone and feeds optimism around near-term catalysts like automotive partnerships and real-world testing. For shareholders, the path forward is still shaped by critical questions: Can QuantumScape translate technical advances into scaled production and repeat customer billings? While the first-ever revenue of US$12.8 million and reduced losses are positive, the stock’s volatility and high price-to-book ratio show that market confidence is still very sensitive to incremental progress. With management highlighting cash runway into 2029, the operational risks now center on production ramp-up and achieving automotive-grade reliability, areas directly influenced by these recent developments. If the Eagle Line pilot and ongoing collaborations deliver, the balance of risk and reward may begin to shift, but uncertainty about when significant revenues will follow remains front and center for most investors.\n<br/> Yet with all this momentum, the risk around scaling to full automotive-grade reliability still looms large.\n</p> QuantumScape's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/be3f5016-19bf-4bc6-b5ac-31a802792b25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirty-two members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate fair value from US$3.78 to US$37.80 per share, illustrating a broad spectrum of investor views.

The latest series of announcements, including long-term nuclear collaborations and the lease of flexible gas turbines, significantly bolster the odds that Fermi can move from concept to initial power generation as early as 2026. These partnerships with global engineering leaders and supportive local government agreements address some of the biggest short-term execution risks by securing technology, fuel, water, and tax incentives, which were major question marks before. The near-term catalyst remains delivery of the first 500 MW of generation capacity, while successful project execution and revenue generation are now even more critical milestones. However, given Fermi’s lack of revenue, unproven business model, and very new management team, material risks still exist despite recent optimism and price gains driven largely by sentiment rather than underlying results.\nBut investors should remember: management experience remains a key issue for a business at this scale.\n</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on Fermi</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cf0e1010-6f0a-428b-ae71-d75e592ca2cd/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$3.50 to US$35 per share.

            "title": "Assessing Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (CRNX) Valuation After Recent 50% Three-Month Share Price Rally",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (CRNX) shares have shown impressive movement over the past three months, rising 50 percent. Investors are watching closely as the company’s performance stands out in the biotechnology sector this quarter.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Crinetics Pharmaceuticals.</a></p> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals has staged a remarkable turnaround after a tough start to the year. Over the last 90 days, the company has delivered a 50 percent share price gain, which stands in stark contrast to its 1-year total shareholder return of -23 percent. This momentum suggests renewed optimism around the company’s prospects, especially following some positive signals in the sector, and indicates that investor sentiment may be shifting in favor of future growth.</p> <p>Looking to discover more in the healthcare space? Now’s a great time to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_healthcare_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With such a rapid rebound, the big question facing investors is whether Crinetics Pharmaceuticals still has room to run or if the market has already anticipated this momentum, making further gains harder to come by.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Book of 3.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of 3.4x, which falls below its peer average of 7x. This suggests the stock appears cheap relative to similar companies in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sector, based on this specific valuation metric.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio is a commonly used measure for companies, especially in sectors where profits may not yet be material, like biotech. It compares a company's market value to its book value, offering a snapshot of how the market is assessing future growth potential or asset strength relative to peers.</p> <p>At 3.4x, Crinetics looks undervalued when contrasted with its peer group but more expensive than the broader US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 2.3x. This disparity may indicate that investors expect strong future growth from Crinetics, which could justify the premium to the wider industry, yet the valuation still lags behind top peers. However, keep in mind that Crinetics is currently unprofitable, and valuation based on book value rather than earnings is typical in early-stage biotech. If the market shifts its fair ratio expectations, the multiple could adjust accordingly.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, investors must consider that unprofitability and sharp recent gains could bring volatility or swift sentiment reversals if expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Crinetics Pharmaceuticals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Perspective</h2> <p>Beyond simple book value comparisons, our DCF model values Crinetics Pharmaceuticals at $112.31 per share, well above its recent price of $42.90. This points to a much deeper undervaluation than what the price-to-book ratio suggests, but it also relies heavily on long-term growth projections that could shift rapidly.
