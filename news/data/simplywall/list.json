            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Banco Comercial Português (ENXTLS:BCP) has posted its FY 2025 numbers with fourth quarter revenue of €953.96 million and basic EPS of €0.018, while trailing twelve month revenue sits at about €3.6 billion and basic EPS at €0.069. Over the past few quarters the bank has seen revenue range from €840.80 million in Q4 2024 to €1.73 billion in Q3 2025, with basic EPS moving between €0.00029 and €0.045 across the same period. This gives investors a clearer view of how earnings power has translated into a 28.2% net profit margin versus 26% a year earlier. These results focus attention on how sustainable those margins and growth drivers appear from here.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Banco Comercial Português.</a> <p>With the latest earnings on the table, the next step is to line these figures up against the widely held narratives around Banco Comercial Português to see which views the numbers support and which they call into question.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Banco Comercial Português</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTLS:BCP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/72de75b3-191d-4fdf-9666-cea3296eb833/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTLS:BCP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Backed By €1.0b Net Income</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Banco Comercial Português earned €1,019 million of net income on €3,617 million of revenue, which is consistent with the 28.2% net profit margin you saw in the headline numbers.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to higher credit volumes in Portugal and Poland and a shift toward SME and corporate lending as key earnings drivers, and these full year figures show that after a €626 million one off loss in the last 12 months, the core business still produced over €1.0b of net income.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters of the bullish view highlight low cost of risk and capital ratios above regulatory minima. The 28.2% margin versus 26% a year earlier lines up with the idea that day to day profitability has held up as that lending mix evolves.</li> <li>At the same time, the large one off charge inside that €1,019 million net income is a reminder that not all of the recent earnings are repeatable, which is exactly the type of earnings quality issue that more cautious investors focus on when they look past headline growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Loan Book And Asset Quality Signal</h2> <ul> <li>Total loans in the quarterly data sit between €37,378.805 million and €56,345.817 million while non performing loans range from €471.239 million to €526.711 million, so problem loans remain a small part of the overall book in absolute terms.</li> <li>Bears worry that pushing harder into SME and corporate lending could eventually lift the cost of risk. Yet the recent quarters show non performing loans moving within a fairly tight band even as the loan book shifts, which so far does not confirm a spike in credit stress.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also flag Mozambique as a source of recurring sovereign risk, and the fact that non performing loans stay under €530 million across the periods given will have them watching closely to see if that holds as provisions against that market play through.</li> <li>For you as an investor, these numbers mean the quality of the assets backing those earnings is something to track each quarter, especially if the bank continues leaning into higher yielding corporate credit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E Premium Versus DCF Gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a 13.4x P/E against a European banks industry average of 11.1x and peer average of 11.6x, yet the current price of €0.924 sits below a DCF fair value of €1.60 and close to the analyst consensus price target of €0.93.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view on valuation point to forecast revenue growth of 5.7% a year and earnings growth of 9.8% a year alongside that €1,019 million of net income, arguing that the higher P/E is partly explained by these growth expectations. Skeptics focus on the richer multiple and the €626 million one off loss when deciding whether the DCF fair value and the small gap to the €0.93 analyst target leave enough margin of safety.\n    <ul> <li>What stands out is that the DCF fair value of €1.60 is well above both the current price and the analyst target, so you are getting two very different valuation signals from the same set of cash flow assumptions and market multiples.</li> <li>If you are trying to reconcile those, it is worth asking whether you are more comfortable leaning on the 13.4x P/E relative to peers or on the implied upside from the DCF, given the recent one off loss and the description of the dividend record as unstable.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, many investors will want to see how the community weighs the higher P/E against the DCF fair value and the recent one off loss, so it can be useful to read the full discussion in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Banco Comercial Português</a>. <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Banco Comercial Português on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of strong margins and one off risks leaves you unsure, review the details now and form your own view with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>Explore Alternatives</h2> <p>For all the solid margins, Banco Comercial Português still carries an unstable dividend record and a large one off loss that raises questions about earnings quality and consistency.</p> <p>If those gaps around income reliability concern you, take a closer look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">449 dividend fortresses</a> today so you can focus on companies with stronger, more consistent payouts.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new 15% global tariffs sharpen the near term focus on margins, which were already under pressure, and increase uncertainty around the key catalyst of earnings stabilization. At the same time, they amplify the biggest current risk: further margin compression from higher product costs layered onto already soft profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the recent decision to maintain a quarterly dividend of US$0.41 per share into April 2026 matters. It signals continued capital returns despite weaker recent earnings and elevated cost headwinds. For investors watching catalysts, that dividend commitment sits alongside NIKE’s ongoing supply chain shifts away from China, a process that could influence how much of the tariff shock ultimately flows through to margins and cash flows.</p> <p>Yet, in contrast, investors should also be aware that margin pressure from tariffs and supply chain shifts could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-nke/nike/0qyl1fu8-nke-upcoming-product-refresh-and-channel-cleanup-will-drive-performance-recovery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on NIKE (it's free!)</a></p><p>NIKE's narrative projects $50.7 billion revenue and $4.4 billion earnings by 2028.

However, this shorter term improvement sits against that 1% five year earnings decline, so the recent lift does not fully counter the longer term drift.\n    <ul> <li>Backers of the bullish angle may point to revenue trending from S$354.6 million in 1H FY 2024 to S$372.2 million in 1H FY 2025, and from S$748.6 million to S$783.1 million on a trailing basis, as a sign that the business is still scaling.</li> <li>At the same time, the five year 1% earnings decline signal means any bullish case has to show how current profitability can be maintained or improved rather than assuming past patterns will simply reverse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic and cautious investors are framing this longer term track record against the latest half year numbers, have a look at what the community is debating around Singapore Land Group right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/U06\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Singapore Land Group.</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 18.9x Sits Between Peers And DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 18.9x, which is below the peer average of 23.1x but slightly above the Singapore real estate industry average of 18.7x. The S$3.59 share price also stands modestly above the S$3.47 DCF fair value.</li> <li>Investors weighing a bullish angle on valuation often see the discount to the 23.1x peer P/E as supportive. Yet that is balanced by two constraints, the slight premium to the 18.7x industry average and the fact that the current S$3.59 share price is higher than the S$3.47 DCF fair value, which together argue for careful attention to how future profit metrics evolve.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters of the bullish view can argue that an 18.9x P/E with a peer discount leaves some room if earnings stabilise relative to the 1% five year decline, but that argument depends heavily on how margins and net income trend from here.</li> <li>Others will focus more on the S$0.204 trailing 12 month EPS and the P/E implied at S$3.59, viewing the gap to DCF fair value as a reason to be measured when judging how much of the current earnings profile is already priced in.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is reported at about $1.45b. Analyst estimates feed into a series of annual free cash flow projections, with Simply Wall St extending these beyond the usual analyst horizon. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $3.43b, with intermediate years between 2026 and 2035 ranging from about $2.74b to just over $4.02b before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model suggests an intrinsic value of roughly $121.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $85.33, this implies a 29.7% discount, so the stock screens as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests eBay is undervalued by 29.7%.

It ties directly to what the business is generating today, which is usually easier to interpret than revenue or book value alone.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>eBay currently trades on a P/E of 19.15x. That sits very close to the Multiline Retail industry average P/E of 19.65x, and well below the peer group average of 38.59x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 19.82x, which is the P/E it would expect for eBay after factoring in elements like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the mix of growth, risk and profitability that is specific to eBay. With the current P/E of 19.15x sitting close to the Fair Ratio of 19.82x, the shares look roughly in line with what this model suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/49564d7c-274f-452b-8679-0ec89f77ad9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You can also see exactly what revenue growth, margins, P/E and discount rate each view is using.</p> <p>Because each Narrative compares its fair value to eBay’s current price and automatically refreshes when new news or earnings data are added, you can quickly see whether your story still justifies buying more, trimming, or simply watching from the sidelines, without having to rebuild your model every time something changes.</p> <p>For eBay however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading eBay Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties together revenue, margins, valuation assumptions and risks into a single, consistent story so you can decide which feels closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/wyqsf8vq-ai-and-live-commerce-will-empower-sustainable-recommerce-xa2e?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 eBay Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$102.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 16.4% below</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 7.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on eBay building a leading global recommerce platform in areas like collectibles, fashion and live commerce, supported by AI tools, enhanced payments and managed shipping.</li> <li>Assumes revenue of about US$13.1b and earnings of about US$2.5b by 2028, with profit margins easing slightly and the shares trading on a future P/E of 20.4x, slightly above today but still below the current US Multiline Retail average.</li> <li>Highlights potential upside from stronger network effects, higher margin revenue streams and ongoing buybacks, while flagging risks such as powerful competitors, dependence on focus categories, regulation and the challenge of attracting younger users.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/7yo5adcu-overvalued-marketplace-will-suffer-from-digital-disruption-ywf9?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 eBay Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: about US$69.62</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value: 22.6% above</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 3.77% per year</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes tougher competition from big tech ecosystems and social commerce platforms, together with changing demographics, as headwinds for user growth, engagement and gross merchandise volume.</li> <li>Uses revenue of about US$11.8b and earnings of about US$2.1b by 2028, along with lower profit margins and a future P/E of 18.14x, with the view that current market expectations could be too optimistic at recent prices.</li> <li>Points to regulatory costs, logistics limitations and pressure on take rates as constraints, and also notes potential support from advertising, AI tools, enthusiast buyers and capital returns if these factors develop more favorably than expected.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame a reasonable range of possible outcomes using the same building blocks shown in the DCF and P/E checks.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Zinzino (OM:ZZ B) has just closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of about SEK1.0b and basic EPS of SEK3.41, while trailing twelve month EPS came in at SEK8.95 on revenue of roughly SEK3.3b. Over recent periods, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from SEK705.48m and EPS of SEK1.25 in Q4 2024 to SEK1,035.30m and EPS of SEK3.41 in Q4 2025. This has occurred against a backdrop of trailing twelve month earnings growth of 91.7% and revenue growth forecasts of about 11.2% a year. With net profit margins running at 9.7% and described as supported by high quality earnings, the release sets up a results season where profitability is front and center for investors.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-zz-b/zinzino-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Zinzino.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely followed narratives around Zinzino’s growth, risks, and profitability, and where those stories might need a rethink.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Profit growth over the last 12 months has therefore been much faster than the revenue pace implied by the forecasts.</li> <li>What stands out for a bullish view is how this profit profile lines up with the business story. Trailing net margin is 9.7% versus 7.7% a year earlier, and five year average annual earnings growth is 30%. Together these figures suggest past profitability has scaled faster than the forecast 9.6% annual earnings growth now being used as the reference point.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on recurring wellness demand may point to FY 2025 quarterly net income moving from SEK55.9m in Q1 to SEK123.6m in Q4 as evidence that the model can produce higher absolute profits than a year ago.</li> <li>At the same time, the 11.2% revenue growth forecast sets a more moderate bar than the recent 91.7% earnings growth. This gives bulls and cautious investors very different reference points when they think about how repeatable these margins might be.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Margins at 9.7% put profitability in focus</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month net income of SEK324.3m on SEK3.3b of revenue implies a 9.7% net margin, compared with 7.7% in the prior year period. A larger share of each krona of sales is therefore currently dropping to the bottom line than a year earlier.</li> <li>For investors who worry on the bearish side about direct sales models being fragile, the margin and EPS pattern creates some useful context. Trailing EPS reached SEK8.95, while FY 2025 quarterly EPS moved from around SEK1.61 in Q1 to SEK3.41 in Q4, which suggests that recent profitability has been achieved with consistent positive earnings across the last six reported quarters.\n    <ul> <li>Critics who question earnings durability still have to weigh that concern against the fact that trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% margin are both well above the Swedish market revenue growth forecast of roughly 0.9% a year cited in the data.</li> <li>At the same time, the forecast earnings growth rate of about 9.6% annually is described as modest, so bears may point out that the step up from a 7.7% to 9.7% margin could prove harder to repeat if the business reverts closer to those forecast growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 17.9x and DCF value of SEK358.99 create a valuation gap</h2> <ul> <li>With the shares at SEK152.00, Zinzino trades on a trailing P/E of 17.9x, compared with a European retail distributors industry average of 13.2x and a DCF fair value in the data of SEK358.99. The shares are therefore priced above the industry multiple but well below that modelled value.</li> <li>What is interesting for a general market view is how those valuation markers sit beside the fundamentals. The company combines a 2.63% dividend yield with trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% net margin, which leaves investors deciding whether the premium to the industry P/E and higher recent share price volatility versus the Swedish market are adequately balanced by the gap between SEK152.00 and the SEK358.99 DCF fair value estimate.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on that DCF fair value may argue that paying 17.9x earnings for a business with five year average annual earnings growth of 30% and forecast revenue growth above the Swedish market is still reasonable.</li> <li>More cautious investors could instead highlight the higher P/E versus the industry average and the recent volatility as reasons to be careful about leaning too heavily on any single valuation model when interpreting the current share price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Beneath these headline figures there is a broader story about how different investors are weighing growth, risk, and valuation, so if you want to see how others are connecting the dots, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/OM/ZZ%20B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Zinzino.</strong></a> </p><h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

For you as a shareholder, the key issue is how any additional compliance requirements could affect contracts, timelines, and capital allocation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the main questions center on how MHI adapts its defense and space operations to evolving Japanese policy and international regulations.

However, the data also show forecast revenue growth of about 5.6% per year, which is below the cited 7.6% annual revenue growth that bullish analysts are assuming, so the current run rate does not fully back the more optimistic revenue path.</li> </ul> <h2>Margins Sit At 9.1% While Costs Rise</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, TJX is reported to have a 9.1% net margin, compared with 8.6% previously, on trailing revenue of US$60.4b and net income of about US$5.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on headwinds like wage inflation and foreign exchange, and the guidance that unfavorable FX is expected to trim consolidated sales growth by 1% and EPS growth by 3% fits that concern. Yet the actual trailing margin at 9.1% is already within the 9.2% margin level that bearish analysts build into their 2028 case, which suggests recent profitability is not far from what the cautious view is assuming several years out.\n    <ul> <li>Incremental wage and payroll costs and a projected 10 to 20 basis point drag on pretax margin from FX are exactly the kind of pressures bearish narratives highlight.</li> <li>At the same time, the reported margin improvement from 8.6% to 9.1% indicates those pressures have not prevented TJX from operating at a higher profitability level in the recent period.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how these cost pressures and margin numbers fit into a fuller cautionary story, skeptics have laid out their case in detail here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/m062sds2-fx-and-china-tariffs-will-test-performance-despite-global-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 TJX Companies Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Premium P/E Versus DCF And Targets</h2> <ul> <li>TJX is shown trading on a 31.5x trailing P/E at a share price of US$155.82, with a DCF fair value of US$102.20 and an analyst price target reference of US$167.88, so the stock sits above the modeled cash flow estimate but below that target level.</li> <li>Bulls argue that strong multi year earnings expansion, including 13% earnings growth over the last year and a five year average of 20.5% per year, justifies paying this premium multiple. However, the same data set also shows forecast earnings growth of about 6.48% per year and revenue growth around 5.6% per year, which is slower than broad US market forecasts and makes the 31.5x P/E and the gap to the US Specialty Retail industry average P/E of 20.1x a key tension point for the bullish case.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 9.1% net margin and history of earnings growth support the idea of a high quality business, which bullish narratives lean on when they point to higher future margins.</li> <li>However, the fact that the current market price is above the DCF fair value of US$102.20 while growth forecasts are closer to mid single digits challenges the idea that quality alone explains the premium valuation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls who think TJX deserves that kind of premium multiple can see how the optimistic story is built around these numbers here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 TJX Companies Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for TJX Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this combination of bullish and cautious views leaves you undecided, now may be a good time to review the numbers yourself and determine your own position.

Over recent quarters the company has seen revenue move from US$1.34 billion in Q4 2024 to US$1.49 billion in Q4 2025, with basic EPS ranging between US$0.22 and US$0.35 over that stretch as FFO per share held in a tight band around US$1.05 to US$1.07.

Of US$3.9b Supports The Income Story</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing twelve month basis, Realty Income generated Funds From Operations of US$3.9b, with FFO per share of US$4.26 and an 18.4% net profit margin, compared with 16.1% a year earlier.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks up the idea that necessity focused retail and industrial tenants plus long leases can support stable, long term rent and dividend growth, and the recent numbers line up with that story:\n    <ul> <li>Trailing FFO of US$3.9b and FFO per share of US$4.26 sit alongside five year earnings growth of 19% per year and a 4.91% dividend yield, which backs the view that cash generation has been solid enough to support regular payouts.</li> <li>At the same time, the one off US$317.9m loss in the last 12 months shows that even with stable tenants, unusual items can still affect reported earnings, so the income story is not completely risk free.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over US$3.9b in FFO, an 18.4% margin, and a 4.91% yield are exactly the kind of numbers bulls on Realty Income like to point to, so if you want to see how that optimistic case is built out in full, check out <a

Case</strong></a><br/> <h2>Premium 58.2x P/E Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>The trailing P/E of 58.2x sits well above the US retail REITs industry average of 27.7x and a peer average of 29.7x, even though the current share price of US$65.99 is below the DCF fair value of US$100.37 and under the analyst price target of US$65.25.</li> <li>Bears focus on valuation and concentration risks, and the current data gives them some clear talking points as well as a few pushbacks:\n    <ul> <li>The 58.2x P/E is more than double the sector average, so critics who say investors are paying a high multiple relative to other retail REITs can point straight to that gap.</li> <li>On the other hand, a DCF fair value of US$100.37 and a price target of US$65.25 compared with a US$65.99 share price mean valuation signals are mixed rather than uniformly stretched, which does not cleanly match a simple overvaluation claim.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing whether that 58.2x P/E is justified or stretched, it is worth seeing how skeptics frame the risks and concentration concerns in their full case on <a

Case</strong></a><br/> <h2>Interest Coverage And One Off Loss Stand Out</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, earnings of US$1.1b on revenue of US$5.8b came alongside a US$317.9m one off loss and flagged weak interest coverage, where interest payments are not well covered by earnings.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights both resilient rent collections and growing international exposure, and the latest figures give you a way to test how balanced that really is:\n    <ul> <li>Net profit margin at 18.4% and trailing earnings growth of 24.8% over the past year support the idea that the core portfolio is still producing healthy profits relative to revenue.</li> <li>Yet, the large US$317.9m one off loss and the warning that interest expense is not well covered by earnings underline that the capital structure is a key watchpoint, especially as Realty Income increases its European exposure and potentially adds more debt to fund deals.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether OR Royalties is still fairly priced after a strong run, this article walks through how its current share price stacks up against different ways of thinking about value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at C$62.66, with returns of 5.1% over 7 days, 0.4% over 30 days, 29.5% year to date, 136.2% over 1 year and 251.2% over 3 years. These figures can change how investors think about both upside potential and risk.</li> <li>Recent coverage of OR Royalties has focused on its royalty and streaming profile and how that structure can appeal to investors who want exposure to the materials sector without operating mines directly. This context helps explain why the share price performance may be drawing more attention from both existing and new shareholders.</li> <li>According to Simply Wall St's value checks, OR Royalties scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a> on undervaluation.

The goal is to estimate what the business might be worth per share at present.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flow projections in $. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $106 million. Analysts and internal estimates project annual free cash flow rising to $513.3 million by 2035, with specific forecast points such as $288.4 million in 2026 and $391 million in 2029. Simply Wall St notes that analysts typically provide up to 5 years of estimates, and the later years are extrapolated within the model.</p> <p>Bringing all those projected cash flows back to today, the DCF produces an estimated intrinsic value of $63.24 per share, compared with the recent share price of C$62.66. That difference suggests the stock is approximately 0.9% undervalued, which is a very small gap.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>OR Royalties is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations or risk levels are more modest.</p> <p>OR Royalties currently trades on a P/E of 41.68x. That is higher than both the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 22.52x and the peer average of 24.97x. On the surface, that suggests the market is paying a richer price for each dollar of OR Royalties' earnings compared with many sector peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for OR Royalties is 20.33x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E could be, given the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. Because it blends these factors, the Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peer or industry averages. With the current P/E of 41.68x sitting well above the Fair Ratio of 20.33x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Here you attach a clear story about OR Royalties to your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, link that story to a financial forecast and a Fair Value, compare that Fair Value to the current price to decide whether the stock looks attractive or not, and then see it update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. For example, one investor might build a more cautious OR Royalties Narrative that aligns with a Fair Value of about C$52.24, while another might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to C$80.37, each reflecting different views on how projects progress, margins develop and what P/E the market is likely to accept.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, here are previews of two leading OR Royalties Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/2p5htw37-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OR Royalties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$80.37</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 22% below this bullish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 30.30% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp model faster growth in royalty volumes from Canadian Malartic, Odyssey Underground and other Tier 1 assets, supported by a mix of gold and growing silver exposure.</li> <li>The narrative focuses on a debt free balance sheet and roughly US$1b of available liquidity to support new royalty and streaming deals that could influence revenue and free cash flow per share.</li> <li>To line up with this view, you would need to be comfortable with earnings rising to US$337.1m by 2028, higher profit margins near 62.5% and a P/E of about 41.3x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/8vp0ahtl-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 OR Royalties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$52.24</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 20% above this bearish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 21.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>This view highlights execution risk at assets such as Canadian Malartic, Dalgaranga and CSA, where timelines, recoveries and mine planning could influence how quickly additional gold equivalent ounces reach OR Royalties.</li> <li>It also considers the possibility that new deals arrive more slowly if management keeps a tight filter on pricing and contract quality in a competitive royalty market.</li> <li>To agree with this stance, you would need to assume earnings of about US$281.0m by 2029, margins around 63.6% and a lower, but still elevated, P/E of about 31.8x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p>These two Narratives show how different assumptions about growth, project execution and valuation multiples can lead to very different fair values for the same stock. The key is to decide which set of assumptions aligns more closely with your own view of OR Royalties and its royalty portfolio.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OR Royalties? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/OR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Linde is still reasonably priced after its recent run, this breakdown will help you see how the current share price lines up with different measures of value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$508.27, with returns of 4.7% over 7 days, 11.7% over 30 days, 18.4% year to date, 11.6% over 1 year, 51.0% over 3 years and 120.0% over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage has focused on Linde as a large industrial gases company. Investors are paying close attention to its role in sectors such as manufacturing and energy. This backdrop has kept interest high as the market weighs how future projects, investments and long term contracts might affect the long term story and what investors are currently willing to pay for the shares.</li> <li>Right now Linde scores 1 out of 6 on our valuation checks for being undervalued.

The idea is to estimate what those future cash flows are worth in today’s dollars and compare that with the current share price.</p> <p>For Linde, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach built on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $5.74b. Analyst estimates and extrapolated figures suggest projected free cash flow of $9.40b by 2030, with a series of annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are discounted back to today.</p> <p>Pulling all of those discounted cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $397.28 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$508.27, this indicates the stock is roughly 27.9% overvalued based on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Linde may be overvalued by 27.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"LIN Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>LIN Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Linde.</a></p> <h2>Approach 2: Linde Price vs Earnings</h2> <p>For a profitable company like Linde, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as relatively resilient, and a lower P/E when they see more risk or slower growth.</p> <p>Linde currently trades on a P/E of 34.41x. That sits above the broader Chemicals industry average P/E of 24.38x and below the peer group average of 40.17x. Simply comparing with peers or the industry gives you a rough sense of how the market is pricing Linde, but it does not adjust for the company’s specific earnings growth profile, profit margins, size or risk.</p> <p>To address that, Simply Wall St estimates a “Fair Ratio” for Linde of 28.92x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth, its industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk profile. Because it is tailored to the company, this Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the sector. With the current P/E of 34.41x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 28.92x, the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St this comes through Narratives, where you set out your own story for Linde, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price. All of this is available within an easy tool on the Community page that updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive. For instance, one investor might build a more optimistic Linde Narrative that lines up with a higher fair value closer to US$576, based on stronger long term project expectations. Another might build a more cautious Narrative tied to a lower fair value near US$381. By seeing those different views side by side, you can decide which story and valuation feels more realistic for you.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Linde? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/LIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The margin lift from 1.6% to 1.8% partly lines up with that, yet the latest half year still shows net income of €90 million on €5.3b of revenue, which is a slim margin, so the bullish view relies on this recent margin level being a base, not a peak.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about margin expansion from around 1.5% to 3.5% over several years, while the trailing 1.8% margin shows some progress but is still far from that 3.5% figure.</li> <li>H1 FY 2025 net income of €90 million is below the €100 million from H1 FY 2024, so the short term pattern does not yet fully match the stronger and more resilient earnings path bulls are hoping for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth look like early support for the bullish story, but the gap between a 1.8% margin today and much higher targets keeps the bull case very dependent on future execution that is not yet in the half year numbers. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/j0gp2vpb-global-electric-adoption-will-expand-connected-vehicle-ecosystems-x1jh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OPmobility Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation Gap Versus €39.56 DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at €17.63 with a trailing P/E of 13.6x, while the provided DCF fair value is €39.56, which is 55.4% above the current price, and the P/E sits above a 12.2x peer average but below the 14x wider European Auto Components group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that the market might be baking in ambitious growth and margin gains. The tension shows up here, because the wide gap between €17.63 and the €39.56 DCF fair value looks supportive for optimists, yet the higher P/E than peers and analyst price target level of €17.94 both suggest other investors are more cautious than that DCF implies.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to rise to €291.9 million by around 2028 with margins moving from roughly 1.5% to 2.7%, but the current trailing earnings base of €185 million and 1.8% margin means that uplift still needs to come through.</li> <li>The consensus target of €17.94 is only slightly above the current €17.63 price and well below the €39.56 DCF fair value, which shows how differently the cash flow model and analyst targets are treating future growth and risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Debt And Dividend Track Record Under Bear Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Risk flags highlight a high level of debt and an unstable dividend history, alongside relatively modest forecast revenue growth of about 2% per year versus a 5.6% market benchmark, even as trailing earnings grew 8.8% and 5 year earnings growth is cited at 16.9% per year.</li> <li>Bears focus on the combination of debt, legacy product exposure and pressure from EV and ESG shifts, and the numbers give them some support, because modest revenue growth expectations alongside that debt profile and an uneven dividend record can limit flexibility if conditions stay tough, even though recent earnings growth and margin improvement mean the company is not matching the more severe earnings pressure that a very bearish view might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 15.1% per year contrasts with only 2% revenue growth, which fits with a bear concern that cost cutting and mix, rather than broad based top line growth, are doing a lot of the work.</li> <li>The unstable dividend and leverage risk do not show up directly in the half year income statement, yet they sit in the background when you weigh how sustainable a 1.8% margin and 8.8% earnings growth might be if the auto cycle or regulation turns less helpful.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are weighing those balance sheet and revenue risks against</p>Next Steps\n<p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/trzoo1aa-analysts-raise-opmobility-price-target-citing-stable-margins-and-improved-risk-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OPmobility on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of optimism and concern feels finely balanced, now is a good time to look through the numbers yourself and stress test your view.

The story is still binary around clinical and regulatory milestones, especially the upcoming EXPLORE-OSA and EXPLORE-CKD readouts and the planned NDA filing. The new US$113.58 million shelf registration tied to ESOP-related shares looks more like financial housekeeping than a major shift in the thesis, but it does underscore the likelihood of further equity usage in a company that is pre-revenue, unprofitable, and not expected to reach profitability in the near term. In the short run, the main catalysts and risks still hinge on lorundrostat data quality, regulatory feedback and future capital raises.</p> However, investors should also weigh the risk of further dilution alongside these clinical milestones.\n\nMineralys Therapeutics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bbd189de-48d6-4798-a6f0-f98a74374c70/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$41 million to a very large US$413 million, reflecting sharply different expectations for Mineralys’ potential.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>The Nvidia-led cybersecurity partnership puts Siemens closer to the core of AI-powered protection for industrial automation, where operational technology has historically been harder to secure than traditional IT. By embedding AI security directly into control systems, Siemens is tying its automation hardware and software more tightly to Nvidia’s data processing units and to partners like Palo Alto Networks and Forescout. For you as an investor, this points to deeper integration across the product stack and potentially stickier customer relationships, especially in sectors such as utilities, transport and advanced manufacturing. On the energy side, Siemens’ presence in controlled environment agriculture and microgrids links its grid, controls and digital offerings to areas where reliability and efficiency are central buying criteria. Taken together, these moves position the company alongside peers such as Schneider Electric, ABB and GE Vernova in key areas of industrial digitalization and power resilience. The partnership approach also helps Siemens stay connected to AI and cybersecurity advances without carrying all the development risk alone.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Siemens Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The AI-powered cybersecurity collaboration directly supports the narrative’s focus on industrial AI and digital automation as drivers of recurring, higher margin software and services revenue.</li> <li>Greater reliance on partners and complex industrial AI stacks could increase execution and integration risk, which lines up with concerns in the narrative about large technology transitions weighing on profitability if rollouts are slower or more costly than expected.</li> <li>The emphasis on controlled environment agriculture and microgrids extends Siemens’ role in electrification and data center adjacent energy infrastructure, which is only partially reflected in the existing focus on hyperscaler demand and grid solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/awgw458i-analysts-debate-siemens-growth-and-valuation-amid-modest-fair-value-increase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Siemens</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Integrating AI-driven cybersecurity into industrial automation and coordinating with multiple partners may increase execution complexity and the risk of cost overruns on large projects.</li> <li>⚠️ Expanding in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture exposes Siemens to policy, subsidy and project funding risks in newer segments, alongside existing concerns that the company has a high level of debt.</li> <li>🎁 The AI cybersecurity partnership and microgrid offerings aim at markets where Siemens already supplies automation, grid equipment and digital tools, which can support cross selling and longer customer relationships.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts highlight several strengths including value, profit and revenue growth and a reliable dividend, which provide context as Siemens targets growing markets such as industrial AI, microgrids and controlled environment agriculture.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track how quickly Siemens and Nvidia translate their AI cybersecurity plans into commercial deployments across factories, grids and transport systems, and whether customers adopt embedded security as standard in new automation projects. In energy infrastructure, watch for contract wins in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture, especially where Siemens can bundle power distribution, control systems and digital monitoring. It is also worth keeping an eye on how these initiatives show up in Siemens’ order intake mix and whether management commentary links them to recurring software or service revenue, compared with more traditional equipment sales.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Siemens, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SIE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Siemens</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This will directly boost free cash flow conversion and capital returns, while also enabling cost-outs ($100m targeted by 2029) to flow through to net profit.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/idnfybif-5g-and-digital-investments-will-transform-australias-telecom-landscape-vzh1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what earnings profile and margin shape sit behind that fair value, and how lower capex, forecast profitability and a higher future earnings multiple all fit together?

On future cash flows, TPG is estimated at A$3.50, below the current A$4.05 share price. This frames the stock as overvalued by this method.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>TTM net income moved from a loss of US$33.4 million in Q4 2024 to a smaller loss of US$18.6 million in Q4 2025, so the company is closer to break even but not yet there.</li> <li>Quarterly figures inside that period swung from a US$13.1 million profit in Q3 2025 to a US$48.3 million loss in Q4 2025, which challenges the idea of a smooth path toward the bullish earnings forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, bulls are essentially arguing that a business still reporting a TTM loss can grow into those forecasts relatively quickly, which is an optimistic read on how fast profitability can improve. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l3rwv1up-us-and-eu-refining-will-fuel-a-green-metals-boom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 AMG Critical Materials Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>US$48.3 million Q4 loss vs earlier 2025 profits</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, AMG moved from net income of US$5.0 million, US$11.5 million and US$13.1 million in Q1, Q2 and Q3 to a net loss of US$48.3 million in Q4, even as quarterly revenue stayed in a fairly tight band between US$388.1 million and US$446.6 million.</li> <li>Bears highlight that heavy capital spending and exposure to commodity prices can hit earnings hard, and this pattern fits that cautious view because:\n    <ul> <li>Losses over the past five years have widened at roughly 6% per year and the latest TTM period still ends in the red, which lines up with concerns about long stretches of uneven profitability.</li> <li>Interest payments are flagged as not well covered by earnings, so a quarter like Q4 2025 with a US$48.3 million loss adds weight to worries about financial pressure if similar periods repeat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics point to this swing back into a sizeable loss as evidence that the path to steady profits may be rougher than headline growth forecasts imply. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/huf0chdo-lithium-volatility-and-geopolitical-risks-will-undermine-refining-prospects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 AMG Critical Materials Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Low P/S and DCF fair value create valuation tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of €33.04, AMG is trading on a P/S of 0.7x compared with peer and industry averages of 5.7x and 0.9x, and sits well below a DCF fair value estimate of €60.83.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests the stock looks inexpensive while still facing meaningful financial risk, and the data backs both sides of that tension because:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the €33.04 price and the €60.83 DCF fair value points to valuation support, even after factoring in that analysts as a group only see roughly 25.6% implied upside to their price target of €41.49.</li> <li>At the same time, the company remains unprofitable on a TTM basis and interest coverage is described as weak, so any case that the current P/S discount is attractive also needs to factor in these ongoing balance sheet and earnings risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie
