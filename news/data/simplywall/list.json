Higher compensation often reflects board confidence in management after a solid year, and Fastenal did report double digit daily sales growth and market share gains in 2025. At the same time, insider buying can suggest that executives and directors are comfortable owning more stock at current prices, which some investors read as a sign that internal expectations remain constructive.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Fastenal Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The higher CEO compensation and insider buying sit alongside Fastenal’s push into digital sales and Fastenal Managed Inventory technology, which management has highlighted as central to growth and margin resilience.</li> <li>Rising executive pay could be questioned if future margins or growth fall short of what is needed to support the company’s investments in supply-chain diversification and on-site distribution.</li> <li>The nearly US$8m in government contracts adds a public-sector angle that is not a major focus of the existing narrative, which has centered more on large industrial customers and digital channels.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ei8gojit-digital-solutions-and-resilient-supply-chains-will-drive-future-strength-ghav\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Fastenal</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A large increase in CEO compensation could become a concern if future performance does not align with pay, especially compared with peers like W.W. Grainger or MSC Industrial.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged at least one risk, including questions around dividend cover by free cash flow, which may influence how you think about capital returns versus reinvestment.</li> <li>🎁 Insider share purchases over the past six months may indicate confidence from those closest to the business in Fastenal’s direction and execution.</li> <li>🎁 Additional government contracts can help diversify revenue sources and provide more visibility on a portion of sales alongside existing industrial customers.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track whether insider buying continues, how executive pay trends relative to sales, earnings, and cash flow, and whether Fastenal wins more national or government contracts that complement its digital and on-site offerings. Comparing Fastenal’s progress and governance practices with distributors like W.W. Grainger and MSC Industrial can also help you judge whether the compensation and contract trends are aligned with long-term value creation.</p> <p>To keep up with how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Fastenal, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FAST\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Fastenal</a> to stay updated on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This comes even though the 1 year total shareholder return is a 10.50% loss, while the 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns of 86.83% and 88.55% point to a much stronger longer term picture.</p> <p>If this move in a specialized healthcare name has you thinking about where else growth themes might emerge, it could be worth scanning our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 healthcare AI stocks</a> as another potential hunting ground.</p> <p>So with LeMaitre Vascular showing solid multi year total returns, growing revenue and net income, and trading at $91.38, is the current price leaving meaningful upside on the table, or is the market already factoring in future growth?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 12.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, LeMaitre Vascular’s fair value sits at $104.78 versus the last close of $91.38. This sets up a valuation gap that hinges on future growth and margins.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Strong pipeline of biologics and next-generation products, combined with ongoing regulatory wins, enhances pricing power and product mix; this supports premium pricing and improved gross margins, with successful launches expected to materially contribute to long-term earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ihxgc0hy-european-and-global-demographics-will-expand-minimally-invasive-care-wrzv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what kind of revenue trajectory and margin profile investors are baking into that fair value, and how those cash flows stack up once discounted?

For investors, the latest update on the Kingsport methanolysis plant matters because it ties Eastman's core plastics and chemicals businesses to circular recycling efforts that many brands and regulators are watching closely.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the combination of cash generation, ongoing cost control, and visible progress on recycling may keep NYSE:EMN on the radar for investors who care about both income and sustainability. The company’s history of dividend payments, together with its recycling initiatives, provides a couple of clear themes to track in future annual updates.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-emn/eastman-chemical/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eastman Chemical</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>For dividend-focused investors, Eastman Chemical’s full year update links directly to how dependable its cash returns might be. The company highlighted strong cash generation and again affirmed a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, which continues a multi year pattern of regular payments. At the same time, Simply Wall St’s risk checks point out that the dividend is not well covered by free cash flow and that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. The recent issue of US$600m in 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2031 adds another fixed claim on future cash. Together, those details suggest you may want to look closely at payout ratios, interest costs, and how much cash is left for reinvestment after dividends and debt service.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Eastman Chemical Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on cost reduction, cash generation, and expanding molecular recycling at Kingsport supports the narrative that efficiency and asset utilization can help free up cash to fund both growth projects and dividends.</li> <li>The additional debt and flagged concerns about cash flow coverage could challenge the idea that cost savings alone will keep returns to shareholders comfortable if end market demand stays weak.</li> <li>The fixed income issuance and detailed recycling ramp at Kingsport add extra color on capital structure and sustainability execution that is not fully captured in the high level narrative.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ujv3juw5-commodity-end-markets-and-recycling-initiatives-will-shape-recovery-prospects-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Eastman Chemical</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Profit margins are lower than last year and debt is not well covered by operating cash flow, which could limit room for dividend growth if trading conditions stay soft.</li> <li>⚠️ The dividend is not well covered by free cash flows, so a higher cash commitment to interest on the new 4.50% notes may tighten headroom for future payouts.</li> <li>🎁 Eastman is trading at a discount to one fair value estimate and is viewed as good value compared to peers such as Dow and LyondellBasell, which can be appealing for income investors willing to accept some risk.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow, and cost savings plus Kingsport recycling progress support the idea that free cash flow could improve over time if execution stays on track.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it makes sense to watch three things if you follow Eastman Chemical for income. First, how free cash flow tracks against the dividend and interest costs on the new US$600m notes. Second, whether margins begin to recover toward prior levels, which would give more support to the payout. Third, progress at Kingsport in converting recycling volumes into consistent earnings and cash.

These plants can run consistently, which lines up with the 24/7 needs of hyperscalers and large corporates. The reported 13.9% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of 2025 sits alongside a dividend profile that includes a common dividend with a five year compound annual growth rate of 10.7% and a preferred Series A payout of US$80.00 per share on an annualized basis. That combination suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still writing large checks for acquisitions. For you as an investor, the key question is whether the earnings base from these acquired assets and power contracts can comfortably service higher interest costs, ongoing capital spending, and both common and preferred dividends over time.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Vistra Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The data center driven acquisitions and new power purchase agreements tie directly into the narrative that rising electricity demand and long duration contracts can support revenue growth and EBITDA expansion.</li> <li>Heavier use of acquisitions and fossil fuel assets, plus a higher leverage profile around 3x adjusted EBITDA, echoes the narrative’s caution that debt and regulatory pressure on gas and nuclear could constrain future margins.</li> <li>The recent step up in common and preferred dividends is not fully reflected in the narrative and adds another layer of capital allocation that could influence how much cash is left for renewables and storage projects.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/d88nwa9z-vst-accelerating-power-demand-will-drive-new-nuclear-and-gas-asset-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Vistra</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which could limit financial flexibility if borrowing costs stay high or new projects run over budget.</li> <li>⚠️ Profit margins of 5.6% compared to 11.4% last year indicate pressure on profitability, which may matter if power prices or plant availability move against Vistra.</li> <li>🎁 Vistra is assessed as trading at a large discount to one estimate of fair value, which some investors may see as providing a margin of safety if the thesis on data center demand plays out.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow 24.84% per year, so if acquisitions and long term contracts perform as planned, the current investment and dividend strategy could be supported by a rising earnings base.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how quickly the newly acquired natural gas and nuclear plants are integrated, what returns Vistra reports on that US$4b outlay, and how stable EBITDA looks as more data center contracts come online. Keep an eye on leverage and interest coverage, because more acquisitions or higher dividends could stretch the balance sheet if power markets turn less favorable. It is also useful to track how Vistra positions itself against peers such as Constellation Energy and Cameco linked nuclear interests, especially around securing multi decade data center power agreements.

As Gucci works through a repositioning, management is effectively asking the rest of the portfolio to carry more weight. For you, the key question is whether houses like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta can deepen their identity without diluting group focus or stretching creative and operational resources at a time when luxury demand is less buoyant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kering Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The increased emphasis on multiple houses lines up with the narrative of product refreshes and store optimization. These are aimed at sharpening brand positioning and improving operating leverage over time.</li> <li>Execution risk at Gucci and other brands, already highlighted in the narrative, is reinforced by this reset. More creative shifts and portfolio changes raise the chance that some collections or market bets do not resonate with consumers.</li> <li>The current news focuses on brand mix and positioning, while the narrative also points to factors like tourism trends and secondhand luxury, which may not be fully reflected in how investors interpret this reset.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/14mdfsvn-ker-beauty-unit-sale-and-licensing-deal-will-shape-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kering</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around Gucci’s repositioning and other creative shifts, which could affect demand if new collections do not connect with core and aspirational buyers.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that Kering’s interest payments are not well covered by earnings. This can limit flexibility if trading conditions stay soft or turn weaker.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts expect earnings to grow strongly over the coming years. This suggests upside if Kering’s portfolio reset and cost discipline play out as planned.</li> <li>🎁 A stronger role for brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta could reduce reliance on a single label and help Kering compete more evenly with peers such as LVMH and Hermès.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Gucci’s refreshed positioning shows up in product traction, pricing, and brand heat, especially with US aspirational shoppers. You can also track whether Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and other houses gain more visibility in key regions without eroding Kering’s overall margin profile. Competitive moves from large groups like LVMH and Richemont on pricing, store openings, and marketing will give extra context for how Kering’s choices are landing with luxury consumers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Kering, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/ENXTPA/KER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Kering</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is reported at about US$699 million. Simply Wall St then extends this with cash flow projections out to 2035, starting with an estimate of US$663.2 million in 2026 and US$743.3 million in 2035, with intermediate years in between. Analysts typically provide forecasts for up to five years, so the later years are extrapolated from earlier trends.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$197.14 per share. With the recent share price at US$755.43, this particular model implies the stock is very expensive relative to its cash flow estimate, with an intrinsic discount indicating it is about 283.2% above the DCF value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ubiquiti may be overvalued by 283.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ubiquiti.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Ubiquiti Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Ubiquiti, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you are paying directly to the earnings the business is currently generating.</p> <p>What counts as a normal or fair P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower one.</p> <p>Ubiquiti currently trades on a P/E of 51.45x. That sits above the Communications industry average P/E of about 40.47x, yet below the peer group average of 77.85x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 36.24x for Ubiquiti, which is an estimate of the P/E that would fit its specific earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific qualities instead of assuming that all businesses in a sector should trade at similar multiples.</p> <p>Comparing Ubiquiti’s actual P/E of 51.45x with the Fair Ratio of 36.24x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These different assumptions can lead to very different fair values and therefore very different views on whether the current US$755.43 price looks attractive or stretched.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ubiquiti? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This process arrives at an estimate of what the business might be worth now.</p> <p>For Pulse Biosciences, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on projected free cash flows in dollars. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $54.7 million. Analyst and extrapolated estimates in the model show cash flows staying negative in the near term, then turning positive by 2030, with projected free cash flow of $10 million in that year. Further out, the model extends these projections through 2035 using estimated growth rates.</p> <p>After discounting all those projected cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2.62 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $19.21, this DCF output suggests the stock is very expensive relative to the cash flows assumed in the model, or in other words, very overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Pulse Biosciences may be overvalued by 633.7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Pulse Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Pulse Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies that are not yet producing consistent profits, P/B is often more useful than P/E because it compares the share price with the accounting value of net assets rather than earnings that may still be negative or volatile.</p> <p>In general, a higher multiple is easier to justify when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while a lower multiple tends to reflect more modest expectations or higher uncertainty. That is why context matters when you look at any headline ratio.</p> <p>Pulse Biosciences currently trades on a P/B of about 16.19x. This sits above the Medical Equipment industry average P/B of about 2.44x and also above the peer group average of around 3.21x. Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the preferred multiple, which estimates what a reasonable P/B might be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can give a more focused view than a simple comparison with industry or peer averages. In this case, the actual 16.19x P/B sits above the Fair Ratio used in the model, which points to the shares trading on a richer multiple than that framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you write your own story for Pulse Biosciences by linking your expectations for revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast, a fair value and a clear comparison of that fair value with today’s price. This is all within an easy Community tool that millions of investors use, and that automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive.

The Renergen acquisition and production update put execution at the Virginia project front and center, with management openly targeting positive operational cash flow by late 2026. In that context, the Emerging Growth Virtual Conference appearance looks more like an investor-relations catalyst than a fundamental one: helpful for shaping the story, but unlikely on its own to change near-term cash burn, project timing, or balance sheet risk. With a volatile share price, rich price to book, and expectations of high revenue growth, the bigger questions still sit around delivering on operational milestones and managing funding needs without further eroding existing shareholders.</p> However, there is one financing and dilution risk here that investors really should understand.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on ASP Isotopes</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8686b2df-74f7-4596-899d-4091f07eee9a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> You are seeing ten different fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community, ranging from well under US$1 to very large upside estimates above US$70.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings at around US$253.37 still offers value after a strong run, you are not alone.</li> <li>The stock has returned 2.7% over the last 7 days, 15.8% over 30 days, 44.8% year to date and 113.5% over 1 year, with a very large 3 year and 5 year return of 268.1% and 300.7% respectively. This naturally raises questions about what is already priced in.</li> <li>These moves have kept MACOM in focus as investors reassess where it fits within the wider semiconductor space and what current optimism implies for future expectations. Recent coverage has largely revolved around its positioning in the sector and whether its share price performance is aligned with its fundamentals.</li> <li>Despite this strong share price history, MACOM currently scores 0 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown in our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation scorecard</a>.

It focuses on the cash the business may generate for shareholders rather than accounting earnings.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $151.8 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further figures out to 2035, including a projected free cash flow of $945.6 million in 2035.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $114.39 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $253.37, this output suggests the stock is 121.5% above this particular estimate of intrinsic value based on the model’s cash flow scenario.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings may be overvalued by 121.5%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. A higher P/E can reflect stronger expected growth or lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E can point to more muted growth expectations or higher uncertainty.</p> <p>MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings is trading on a P/E of 117.26x. That sits well above the Semiconductor industry average of 44.48x and also above the peer average of 39.25x. On the surface, that kind of gap suggests investors are paying a much higher price for each dollar of earnings than is typical for the sector or for similar companies.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for MACOM, at 38.30x, is designed to be a more tailored yardstick than a simple peer or industry comparison. It incorporates factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, margins, size and risk characteristics, then estimates what would be a reasonable P/E given those inputs. Because it looks at company specific drivers as well as its sector and market cap, it aims to be a more rounded guide to what might be considered a balanced valuation range.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 117.26x with the Fair Ratio of 38.30x points to MACOM trading well above that model based assessment.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might lean toward the more cautious US$160.00 fair value with 14.65% annual revenue growth, a 28.48% profit margin and a future P/E of 40.08x. By comparing each Narrative’s fair value with the current share price you can see which story, if any, lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Narratives:</p> <p>Each one takes the same business data and applies a different set of expectations, so you can quickly see which assumptions feel closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/i4lpvwos-ai-and-5g-demand-will-shape-future-semiconductor-landscape-02wu?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$255.73</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 0.9% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 16.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish case leans on MACOM’s exposure to AI, 5G, data center and SATCOM demand, with those end markets expected to support revenue growth and higher margins over time.</li> <li>It assumes that operational work at the RTP fab and across the manufacturing footprint eventually supports higher gross and operating margins, while R&amp;D and M&amp;A are used to support new optical and RF products.</li> <li>The fair value of about US$255.73 reflects those growth and margin expectations, together with a future P/E assumption and a discount rate of 10.53%, and sits close to where the shares most recently traded.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/91okis49-update-for-macom-technology-solutions-holdings?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 58.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 14.65% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bearish case focuses on execution and cycle risks, highlighting MACOM’s reliance on data center optical ramps, carrier capex and defense programs, and the possibility that new fab capacity is underutilized.</li> <li>It assumes revenue still grows and margins improve, but that the market may be assigning too high a P/E multiple relative to those earnings, especially if product ramps or customer programs are slower than expected.</li> <li>The fair value of US$160.00 is based on those more cautious assumptions and sits well below the recent share price, which implies that expectations embedded in the current price are demanding in this scenario.</li> </ul> <p>Putting these side by side shows how much the outcome for MACOM depends on your confidence in future growth, margin progress and capital deployment.

A long distance, multi state project of this size can expand Exelon’s rate base exposure to transmission, an area many utilities view as core to meeting rising load from data centers, industrial electrification and clean energy projects. At the same time, management has recently tapped the bond market with US$775 million of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2036, which could help fund large scale infrastructure or refinance existing debt. That combination of new capex needs and additional long term debt keeps the spotlight on execution, cost recovery and interest coverage over the next decade.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Exelon Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The PJM backed project aligns with the narrative that growing electricity demand and supportive state policies are expanding Exelon’s grid investment opportunities through larger transmission build outs.</li> <li>Rising capital requirements for projects like this line can pressure Exelon’s balance sheet and increase its dependence on constructive regulatory outcomes, which is already flagged as a key risk.</li> <li>The competitive PJM award alongside a partner such as NextEra Energy Transmission (a unit of NextEra Energy) may not be fully captured in earlier commentary on Exelon’s transmission pipeline and could influence how future project wins are assessed versus peers such as Duke Energy or American Electric Power.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/2shlamqo-electric-infrastructure-will-expand-as-demand-and-regulatory-stability-shape-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Exelon</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Large, multi state projects increase execution and regulatory risk if timelines slip or cost recovery is slower than expected, and analysts have flagged interest coverage as a concern.</li> <li>⚠️ Additional long term debt such as the 4.95% notes due 2036 adds to fixed interest obligations, which can limit flexibility if operating conditions or rate decisions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A PJM approved, high voltage line supports Exelon’s position in long haul transmission, an area that can offer regulated returns as demand for grid capacity grows.</li> <li>🎁 The project is intended to support reliability and affordability for customers, which aligns with Exelon’s customer first initiatives, including programs to manage higher energy bills and protect smaller users from large infrastructure costs.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth tracking how Exelon and NextEra Energy Transmission advance permitting, community engagement and construction milestones, as any changes could affect cost profiles. Keep an eye on how regulators allocate project costs across states and customer classes, given Exelon’s focus on shielding residential and small business customers from large transmission charges. The recent US$775 million note issuance also puts future interest expense and credit metrics in focus. Watching updates from PJM, Exelon’s rate cases and commentary from peers such as NextEra Energy, Duke Energy and American Electric Power can give you context on how competitive large transmission projects remain for Exelon.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Exelon, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/EXC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Exelon</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The pattern of quarterly EPS swinging from US$0.43 to US$0.63 then to US$0.39 and US$0.51, alongside net income moving between about US$27.1 million and US$41.4 million in 2025, gives you a reminder that:\n    <ul> <li>Reported earnings can be lumpy quarter to quarter even when the trailing twelve month line shows 17.3% earnings growth.</li> <li>Claims about resilient EPS growth need to be balanced against this intra year volatility when you think about how steady future distributions and reinvestment capacity might be.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On a year like this where revenue keeps building but quarterly EPS jumps around, many bullish investors look beyond a single period and focus on the full story behind future growth and valuation, which you can do by checking out <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Trinity Capital Bull Case</strong></a> for more detail.\n\n<h2>P/E of 8.6x and 44% gap to DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>With a share price of US$15.40, Trinity trades on a trailing P/E of 8.6x, compared with peer and industry averages of 21.4x and 23x, and sits about 44.2% below a DCF fair value of roughly US$27.60.</li> <li>Bears highlight the high proportion of non cash earnings, limited coverage of interest costs and a 13.25% dividend by earnings and free cash flow, as well as recent shareholder dilution. These concerns sit alongside the low P/E and large gap to DCF fair value in a way that:\n    <ul> <li>Supports caution that a simple comparison to peer P/E multiples may not tell the whole story if a chunk of the 48.5% net margin is driven by items that do not translate into cash.</li> <li>Reinforces the idea that a 13.25% yield plus a low multiple is not automatically comfortable when interest and dividends are flagged as not well covered, so the apparent valuation gap to US$27.60 DCF fair value needs to be weighed against these balance sheet and cash coverage pressures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing a low 8.6x P/E against those cash coverage flags, it helps to see how more cautious investors frame the risks, which you can do through <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Trinity Capital Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/hmjlfgj8-tightening-capital-and-vc-pullbacks-will-hurt-credit-quality-ltu4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Trinity Capital on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>On balance, does this mix of growth, volatility and valuation gaps leave you confident or cautious?

The February drill results and launch of a 50,000‑metre program, now guided by Objectivity’s data analytics, slot directly into the near‑term catalysts: an updated Mineral Resource Estimate and further definition of higher‑grade zones that could influence future economic studies. With the share price already up very sharply over the past year and equity financing heavily funding this work, the new assays look directionally supportive rather than thesis‑changing on their own. The bigger swing factors remain resource quality, permitting, and continued access to capital if drilling and studies take longer or cost more than expected.</p> However, investors should also weigh how reliant the story still is on fresh equity funding.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our comprehensive valuation report</a> raises the possibility that Omai Gold Mines is priced higher than what may be justified by its financials.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c6b53872-2855-4958-bf1d-0d4b71bd06c8/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Three Simply Wall St Community valuations span roughly US$9.70 billion to US$97.00 billion, underlining how far opinions can stretch.
