Over the past few quarters, the company has seen revenue move from US$84.1 million in Q3 2024 to US$92.9 million in Q4 2024 and then to US$118.1 million in Q4 2025, with quarterly basic EPS ranging from about US$0.05 to US$0.11 across that stretch. With a trailing net profit margin of 11.6%, the latest earnings print gives investors a clear view of a business that is currently generating consistent profits.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\"

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>TTM profit of US$48.6 million supports 11.6% margin story</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last twelve months to Q4 2025, MiMedx generated about US$418.6 million of revenue and US$48.6 million of net income, which lines up with the 11.6% net margin mentioned earlier and shows profit has stayed in the low double digits.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view links this kind of profitability to long term earnings potential, yet the small move in net margin from about 12% to 11.6% shows that while the business is currently earning solid profits, it is not breaking away from margin pressure as clearly as the consensus narrative suggests.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly EPS range of US$0.05 to US$0.11 keeps growth grounded</h2> <ul> <li>Across the last six reported quarters, basic EPS has sat in a fairly tight band between roughly US$0.05 and US$0.11 per share, with Q4 2025 at about US$0.10 and trailing twelve month EPS at about US$0.33, which shows earnings are positive but not moving in a straight line.</li> <li>Supporters in the bullish camp point to strong clinical positioning and product expansion as drivers of long term earnings, yet the step up and down in quarterly EPS within this US$0.05 to US$0.11 range reminds you that even with those tailwinds, the earnings path has been bumpy rather than smooth so far.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative highlights diversified product expansion and operational efficiencies as reasons to expect stronger earnings over time, while the actual EPS path from about US$0.05 in Q1 2025 to roughly US$0.11 in Q3 2025 and US$0.10 in Q4 2025 shows that cost and revenue timing still matter a lot quarter to quarter.</li> <li>Backers also argue that investments in clinical trials and new launches can support margin improvement, but with trailing twelve month net income of around US$48.6 million on US$418.6 million of revenue, the current earnings base is still modest compared with the growth ambitions in that bullish story.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue there is more to this EPS trend than the last few quarters show, and if you want to see how they frame the upside case in detail you can check out <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MiMedx Group Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E of 15.1x vs slower 3.8% revenue forecast</h2> <ul> <li>MiMedx is reported on a trailing P/E of 15.1x compared with a DCF fair value of US$14.55 per share and a current share price of US$4.94, while revenue growth is projected at about 3.8% per year, which is slower than the 10.4% figure cited for the broader US market.</li> <li>Critics in the bearish narrative focus on reimbursement changes and a concentrated product set as reasons that growth could be pressured, and the combination of a 3.8% revenue growth forecast and a net margin close to 11.6% gives those worries some footing even though the current P/E is lower than the 23x industry average.\n    <ul> <li>The bearish view highlights potential Medicare reforms and possible market contraction as threats to both volumes and margins, and the already slower projected top line growth compared with the broader market shows why those policy shifts matter for future revenue lines.</li> <li>Concerns about reliance on a limited placental allograft portfolio also tie back to the 11.6% net margin, because if reimbursement or competing products affect that core segment, the current earnings level of roughly US$48.6 million on US$418.6 million of sales could be sensitive to any shock in that main business.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics watching that 15.1x P/E against slower projected growth may want to see how a more cautious case is laid out in full through <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener

The CRC Holdings LLC restructuring looks more like plumbing than a major earnings swing in the near term; it is designed to make financing easier for CastleRock Communities rather than transform group profitability overnight. In the short run, the more visible catalysts are management’s guidance for FY 2026 and the step up in the year‑end dividend, set against modest forecast growth and recent underperformance versus the broader Japanese market. The bigger risks still sit around leverage, cash flow coverage of dividends and the potential for overseas expansion to add complexity without offsetting returns.</p> However, there is one financing and balance sheet risk here that investors should not ignore.\nDaiwa House Industry's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 15%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-1925/daiwa-house-industry-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-1925/daiwa-house-industry-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:1925 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/39d34d27-af63-4335-88cb-bd5046bbf6e7/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:1925 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community currently contributes 1 fair value view for Daiwa House Industry at ¥4,869, showing how differently individual investors can assess the same business.

This puts new numbers around how the business is performing today and what management expects next.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for FTI Consulting.</a></p> <p>The 5.1% 1 day share price return after the results, with the stock now at $168.11, comes after a mixed few months where a 30 day share price decline of 8.1% contrasts with a modestly positive 1 year total shareholder return of 2.0%. This suggests recent trading momentum has picked up as investors react to the earnings beat and 2026 guidance.</p> <p>If these earnings have you thinking about where professional services and technology intersect, it could be a good moment to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 top founder-led companies</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With FTI Consulting posting higher quarterly sales and diluted EPS alongside 2026 guidance that points to more revenue and earnings, you now have to ask yourself whether there is still upside here or whether the market is already pricing in that growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 5.3% Undervalued</h2> <p>With FTI Consulting closing at $168.11 against a narrative fair value of $177.50, the current price sits below what this widely followed view considers reasonable, and that gap comes from some very specific assumptions about growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The consulting industry's trend toward consolidation and the challenging macro climate are expected to drive \"shakeouts\" among weaker competitors, strengthening FTI's competitive position, client retention, and potential for market share gains, all of which could result in sustainable margin expansion and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Want to see what sits behind that confidence in margins and earnings? The narrative leans on steady revenue progress, firmer profitability, and a future earnings multiple that is lower than many peers. The key point is how those moving parts line up over several years. If you want to understand the full playbook behind the $177.50 fair value, the complete narrative spells out every assumption.</p> <p>In this narrative, discounting future earnings back at just over 7% and pairing mid single digit revenue growth with higher profit margins creates a path that supports the current fair value estimate. Analysts also assume fewer shares on issue and a future P/E that is below where the broader professional services space sits today, which together help close the gap between today’s price and that $177.50 figure.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $177.50 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/didodtsg-fcn-revenue-outlook-adjustments-and-cfo-transition-will-shape-next-chapter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, there are clear watchpoints, including pressure on higher billing rates if competition intensifies and the risk that automation could chip away at some consulting demand.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-fcn/fti-consulting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FTI Consulting narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Tell A Different Story</h2> <p>While the narrative fair value of $177.50 suggests FTI Consulting is 5.3% undervalued, our DCF model points in the opposite direction, with the shares trading well above an estimated future cash flow value of $0.16. That is a very large gap.

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025, alongside EPS shifting from C$0.49 to C$0.95 over the same period. This sets up an earnings picture where recent quarterly profitability contrasts with a loss making trailing 12 month base.

Critics argue this keeps cash flow and long term earnings visibility under pressure even as individual quarters like Q4 look strong.\n    <ul> <li>Bears also point to weak coverage of interest costs and dividends, with earnings currently not covering a 3.32% dividend yield or interest expense.

However, the current modest 1.7% revenue growth rate and history of wind resource issues and curtailments in places like the German offshore assets show how sensitive actual revenue can be to weather and power price conditions.\n    <ul> <li>On the supportive side for bulls, Q4 2025 revenue of C$725.3 million and net income of C$249.5 million follow Q4 2024 revenue of C$582.3 million and net income of C$126.8 million, which aligns with the view that new assets and better contract mix can improve earnings in stronger periods.</li> <li>Against that, the same 12 month data set still shows the business unprofitable and dropping several onshore and battery projects in Ontario, Alberta, and New York. This pushes back on the idea that growth from here is straightforward or that all pipeline projects will translate into higher revenue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> For investors weighing that slower 1.7% revenue growth against the big project pipeline, it helps to see how others frame the trade off between new capacity, weather risk, and contract quality. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Northland Power Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation sits below both DCF fair value and peers</h2> <ul> <li>At a current share price of C$21.69, Northland Power trades below the DCF fair value of about C$23.78 and at a P/S of 2.3x, compared with 3.0x for the broader North American renewable energy industry and 3.5x for peers.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that expansion into grid scale storage and offshore wind and the use of long term, inflation linked contracts could justify these lower multiples over time. Yet the combination of a trailing loss of C$163.2 million and interest expenses that are not well covered by earnings means the current discount can also be read as the market pricing in balance sheet risk and a reliance on analyst forecasts that expect earnings of C$454.1 million by around 2028.\n    <ul> <li>The spread between the share price of C$21.69 and DCF fair value of C$23.78, plus a forecast earnings growth rate of about 40% per year and an analyst target of C$22.42, are the main numbers backing the view that the shares are not expensive\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n65x0uiq-grid-storage-and-offshore-wind-will-deliver-a-brighter-future-uxos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Northland Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With bulls and bears both making strong cases here, it is worth getting familiar with the full set of numbers and forming your own view quickly.

Trailing 12 month figures show revenue of about US$2.2 billion and a basic EPS loss of US$4.27, keeping the story firmly in loss-making territory. Over recent periods the company has seen revenue move from US$475.2 million in Q4 2024 to US$596.4 million in Q4 2025. This has come alongside quarterly EPS that has swung between a profit of US$0.20 in Q1 2025 and a loss of US$7.29 in Q2 2025, so investors are watching how quickly that volatility settles into more stable margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\"

roughly US$1.0b, so this is a business with strong top line scale that is still firmly in loss making territory.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that analysts are pairing this 30.7% revenue growth over the last year with forecast earnings growth of about 116.54% per year,\n    <ul> <li>Revenue moving from US$1.7b to about US$2.2b over the last 12 months aligns with the bullish view that digital banking adoption and higher value products like MyPay and Chime Card can support future growth.</li> <li>At the same time, the current trailing 12 month loss of roughly US$1.0b is a reminder that the optimistic margin assumptions in the bullish case depend on a significant shift from today’s loss making base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some bulls argue this mix of US$2.2b in revenue and heavy current losses could be the setup for a sharp earnings swing if their margin expectations play out, but they are starting from a very loss heavy year.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/tgtbueur-update-for-chime-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Chime Financial Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Quarterly Profit Swings Highlight Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, net income ranged from a profit of US$12.9 million in Q1 to a loss of US$923.4 million in Q2, with Q3 and Q4 losses of US$54.7 million and US$44.8 million, so profitability has moved around a lot within a single year.</li> <li>Bears focus on this pattern when they question how smooth the road to profitability might be,\n    <ul> <li>The very large loss in Q2 2025, alongside much smaller losses in Q3 and Q4, supports the cautious narrative that scaling products like MyPay and instant loans could expose Chime to earnings volatility if credit costs or operating expenses spike again.</li> <li>Even with revenue between US$518.7 million and US$596.4 million across the 2025 quarters, the shift from a small profit in Q1 to sizable losses later in the year gives skeptics concrete data to reference when they argue that earnings quality is still unproven.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors often point to the jump from a US$12.9 million profit to a US$923.4 million loss within the same year as a key reason to treat any profitability timelines with caution.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Relies On Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Chime is trading on a P/S ratio of 4.2x compared with peers at 2.0x and the US Diversified Financial industry at 2.4x, so the market is currently valuing each dollar of Chime’s sales at a clear premium to its reference group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative ties that higher multiple to expectations for faster growth,\n    <ul> <li>Forecast revenue growth of 16.7% per year compared with 10.4% for the broader US market is one reason investors may be comfortable paying more than peers for each dollar of current revenue.</li> <li>At the same time, the company is still loss making on a trailing 12 month basis, so the premium P/S ratio is being supported by growth forecasts rather than current profitability, which leaves less room if those forecasts

The company has seen quarterly revenue range from NOK2.9b to NOK3.4b over 2025, with basic EPS moving from a loss of NOK0.99 in Q1 to NOK20.62 in Q2, NOK10.84 in Q3 and NOK3 in Q4. Trailing twelve month EPS has tracked between NOK21.81 and NOK33.4 over the last six reported periods.

That supports the idea that profitability, not just top line, is doing more of the work.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls point to wind service and new wind farms as key earnings drivers, and the move from NOK927.6m to NOK1.4b in trailing net income over the last six reported periods is consistent with that stronger earnings story.</li> <li>At the same time, operational issues mentioned in the bearish narrative, like downtime at certain wind farms and lower power prices in Sweden, are not yet visible in these full year margin and earnings figures. This may make bulls more confident than bears about profit resilience.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that improved margins and earnings give Bonheur more room to handle project hiccups before profits come under pressure, which is exactly what the latest 11.4% net margin suggests at face value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/jq8q31gd-floating-wind-and-renewables-will-drive-demand-despite-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Bonheur Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E of 7.8x vs slower forecast growth</h2> <ul> <li>Bonheur is trading on a trailing P/E of 7.8x, which sits below the Norwegian market at 14.2x, peers at 16.7x and European Industrials at 21.6x. In this dataset, earnings are forecast to decline about 10.8% per year over the next three years and revenue is expected to grow around 0.5% per year versus 3.9% for the wider Norwegian market.</li> <li>Skeptics highlight that a low P/E can be a value signal or a warning, and the bearish narrative leans on those forward numbers to argue that the multiple is low because the market is already factoring in slower growth.\n    <ul> <li>The contrast between 24.8% trailing earnings growth and the expected 10.8% annual decline is exactly the kind of swing bears focus on when they say recent profits may not be a good guide to the next few years.</li> <li>With the share price at NOK260 and analysts in this dataset expecting earnings to shrink while margins ease from 9.4% to 8.2% in the bearish case, the gap between strong recent profitability and softer forecasts is central to that cautious stance.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that the combination of a low P/E and projected earnings declines can sometimes signal a value trap rather than a bargain, which is why they lean more heavily on the forward numbers than the trailing growth. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/id87qqn3-higher-borrowing-costs-and-supply-disruptions-will-strangle-wind-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Bonheur Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>DCF fair value of NOK87.02 vs NOK260 price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value in this dataset is NOK87.02 per share, compared with the current share price of NOK260 and an allowed analyst price target of NOK306.00. This sets up a wide range of views on what the business may be worth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative thinking tries to balance this by pointing out that while analysts expect earnings to reach about NOK957.7m by 2028 with margins easing to 7.6%, they are still using a 14.1x P/E on those earnings to justify targets closer to NOK306.00, which sits well above the DCF fair value but below very aggressive bullish assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>The fact that trailing earnings sit at NOK1.4b, above that NOK957.7m 2028 estimate, helps explain why a cash flow model might point to NOK87.02, while a multiple based on today’s 7.8x P/E and analysts’ future 14.1x assumption can support higher targets.</li> <li>For you as an investor, the tension between a DCF number far below the market price, a market P/E well below peers and an analyst target at NOK306.00 highlights how sensitive valuation is to which metric you trust most.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jq8q31gd-floating-wind-and-renewables-will-drive-demand-despite-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bonheur on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious views leaves you unsure, quickly review the numbers yourself and weigh both sides using <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/capital-goods/ob-bonhr/bonheur-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Bonheur's low 7.8x P/E alongside forecasts for annual earnings declines of about 10.8% and lower future margins suggests the current profit story may be fragile.</p> <p>If that mix of weaker earnings expectations and a wide gap between DCF fair value and the share price worries you, check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">231 high quality undervalued stocks</a> that pair stronger fundamentals with prices that look more grounded in their cash flow profiles.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of ¥46.2b, so the valuation leans heavily on expected improvements in future cash generation rather than recent cash flow alone.</p> <p>Analysts have provided free cash flow estimates out to 2030, with projections such as ¥278.8b for 2026 and ¥359.7b for 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates additional years of cash flows to complete the 10 year projection, all still in ¥ and then discounted back to today.</p> <p>Putting all of those cash flows together, the DCF model suggests an estimated intrinsic value of about ¥5,305 per share, compared with the recent share price of ¥3,051. That gap implies the stock screens as around 42.5% undervalued on this measure alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Daiichi Sankyo Company is undervalued by 42.5%.

This makes it a practical way to compare companies of different sizes within the same sector.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on expectations and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or perceived stability can support a higher P/E, while lower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious P/E range.</p> <p>Daiichi Sankyo Company currently trades on a P/E of 18.5x. That is above the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 16.0x, but below the peer group average of 31.3x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the stock of 32.3x, which is the P/E it might reasonably trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming it should trade in line with broad averages. With the current P/E of 18.5x sitting well below the Fair Ratio of 32.3x, the shares currently appear undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4568/daiichi-sankyo-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4568 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3da34022-ad84-492d-b476-e9d83a1ae4e6/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4568 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Your Narrative will automatically refresh when new earnings, news or analyst updates are added, so your view remains current.</p> <p>For example, one Daiichi Sankyo Company Narrative could lean closer to the higher analyst fair value around ¥6,300, built on stronger growth and margins. Another could sit nearer the lower fair value around ¥3,623, built on more cautious assumptions about growth, profitability and future P/E. Both perspectives can coexist side by side on the platform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Daiichi Sankyo Company? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/4568\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tse-4568/daiichi-sankyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4568 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3da34022-ad84-492d-b476-e9d83a1ae4e6/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4568 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The goal is to estimate what the business might be worth per share at present.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flow projections in $. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $106 million. Analysts and internal estimates project annual free cash flow rising to $513.3 million by 2035, with specific forecast points such as $288.4 million in 2026 and $391 million in 2029. Simply Wall St notes that analysts typically provide up to 5 years of estimates, and the later years are extrapolated within the model.</p> <p>Bringing all those projected cash flows back to today, the DCF produces an estimated intrinsic value of $63.24 per share, compared with the recent share price of C$62.66. That difference suggests the stock is approximately 0.9% undervalued, which is a very small gap.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>OR Royalties is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations or risk levels are more modest.</p> <p>OR Royalties currently trades on a P/E of 41.68x. That is higher than both the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 22.52x and the peer average of 24.97x. On the surface, that suggests the market is paying a richer price for each dollar of OR Royalties' earnings compared with many sector peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for OR Royalties is 20.33x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E could be, given the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. Because it blends these factors, the Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peer or industry averages. With the current P/E of 41.68x sitting well above the Fair Ratio of 20.33x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Here you attach a clear story about OR Royalties to your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, link that story to a financial forecast and a Fair Value, compare that Fair Value to the current price to decide whether the stock looks attractive or not, and then see it update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. For example, one investor might build a more cautious OR Royalties Narrative that aligns with a Fair Value of about C$52.24, while another might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to C$80.37, each reflecting different views on how projects progress, margins develop and what P/E the market is likely to accept.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, here are previews of two leading OR Royalties Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/2p5htw37-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OR Royalties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$80.37</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 22% below this bullish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 30.30% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp model faster growth in royalty volumes from Canadian Malartic, Odyssey Underground and other Tier 1 assets, supported by a mix of gold and growing silver exposure.</li> <li>The narrative focuses on a debt free balance sheet and roughly US$1b of available liquidity to support new royalty and streaming deals that could influence revenue and free cash flow per share.</li> <li>To line up with this view, you would need to be comfortable with earnings rising to US$337.1m by 2028, higher profit margins near 62.5% and a P/E of about 41.3x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/8vp0ahtl-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 OR Royalties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$52.24</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 20% above this bearish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 21.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>This view highlights execution risk at assets such as Canadian Malartic, Dalgaranga and CSA, where timelines, recoveries and mine planning could influence how quickly additional gold equivalent ounces reach OR Royalties.</li> <li>It also considers the possibility that new deals arrive more slowly if management keeps a tight filter on pricing and contract quality in a competitive royalty market.</li> <li>To agree with this stance, you would need to assume earnings of about US$281.0m by 2029, margins around 63.6% and a lower, but still elevated, P/E of about 31.8x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p>These two Narratives show how different assumptions about growth, project execution and valuation multiples can lead to very different fair values for the same stock. The key is to decide which set of assumptions aligns more closely with your own view of OR Royalties and its royalty portfolio.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OR Royalties? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/OR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Linde is still reasonably priced after its recent run, this breakdown will help you see how the current share price lines up with different measures of value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$508.27, with returns of 4.7% over 7 days, 11.7% over 30 days, 18.4% year to date, 11.6% over 1 year, 51.0% over 3 years and 120.0% over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage has focused on Linde as a large industrial gases company. Investors are paying close attention to its role in sectors such as manufacturing and energy. This backdrop has kept interest high as the market weighs how future projects, investments and long term contracts might affect the long term story and what investors are currently willing to pay for the shares.</li> <li>Right now Linde scores 1 out of 6 on our valuation checks for being undervalued.

The idea is to estimate what those future cash flows are worth in today’s dollars and compare that with the current share price.</p> <p>For Linde, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach built on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $5.74b. Analyst estimates and extrapolated figures suggest projected free cash flow of $9.40b by 2030, with a series of annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are discounted back to today.</p> <p>Pulling all of those discounted cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $397.28 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$508.27, this indicates the stock is roughly 27.9% overvalued based on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Linde may be overvalued by 27.9%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"LIN Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>LIN Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Linde.</a></p> <h2>Approach 2: Linde Price vs Earnings</h2> <p>For a profitable company like Linde, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as relatively resilient, and a lower P/E when they see more risk or slower growth.</p> <p>Linde currently trades on a P/E of 34.41x. That sits above the broader Chemicals industry average P/E of 24.38x and below the peer group average of 40.17x. Simply comparing with peers or the industry gives you a rough sense of how the market is pricing Linde, but it does not adjust for the company’s specific earnings growth profile, profit margins, size or risk.</p> <p>To address that, Simply Wall St estimates a “Fair Ratio” for Linde of 28.92x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth, its industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk profile. Because it is tailored to the company, this Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the sector. With the current P/E of 34.41x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 28.92x, the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St this comes through Narratives, where you set out your own story for Linde, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price. All of this is available within an easy tool on the Community page that updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive. For instance, one investor might build a more optimistic Linde Narrative that lines up with a higher fair value closer to US$576, based on stronger long term project expectations. Another might build a more cautious Narrative tied to a lower fair value near US$381. By seeing those different views side by side, you can decide which story and valuation feels more realistic for you.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Linde? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/LIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company has seen revenue move from €5.1b and EPS of €0.49 in H2 2024 to €5.3b and EPS of €0.63 in H1 2025, compared with a prior H1 2024 reference point of €5.4b in revenue and EPS of €0.69.

The margin lift from 1.6% to 1.8% partly lines up with that, yet the latest half year still shows net income of €90 million on €5.3b of revenue, which is a slim margin, so the bullish view relies on this recent margin level being a base, not a peak.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about margin expansion from around 1.5% to 3.5% over several years, while the trailing 1.8% margin shows some progress but is still far from that 3.5% figure.</li> <li>H1 FY 2025 net income of €90 million is below the €100 million from H1 FY 2024, so the short term pattern does not yet fully match the stronger and more resilient earnings path bulls are hoping for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth look like early support for the bullish story, but the gap between a 1.8% margin today and much higher targets keeps the bull case very dependent on future execution that is not yet in the half year numbers. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/j0gp2vpb-global-electric-adoption-will-expand-connected-vehicle-ecosystems-x1jh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OPmobility Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation Gap Versus €39.56 DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at €17.63 with a trailing P/E of 13.6x, while the provided DCF fair value is €39.56, which is 55.4% above the current price, and the P/E sits above a 12.2x peer average but below the 14x wider European Auto Components group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that the market might be baking in ambitious growth and margin gains. The tension shows up here, because the wide gap between €17.63 and the €39.56 DCF fair value looks supportive for optimists, yet the higher P/E than peers and analyst price target level of €17.94 both suggest other investors are more cautious than that DCF implies.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to rise to €291.9 million by around 2028 with margins moving from roughly 1.5% to 2.7%, but the current trailing earnings base of €185 million and 1.8% margin means that uplift still needs to come through.</li> <li>The consensus target of €17.94 is only slightly above the current €17.63 price and well below the €39.56 DCF fair value, which shows how differently the cash flow model and analyst targets are treating future growth and risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Debt And Dividend Track Record Under Bear Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Risk flags highlight a high level of debt and an unstable dividend history, alongside relatively modest forecast revenue growth of about 2% per year versus a 5.6% market benchmark, even as trailing earnings grew 8.8% and 5 year earnings growth is cited at 16.9% per year.</li> <li>Bears focus on the combination of debt, legacy product exposure and pressure from EV and ESG shifts, and the numbers give them some support, because modest revenue growth expectations alongside that debt profile and an uneven dividend record can limit flexibility if conditions stay tough, even though recent earnings growth and margin improvement mean the company is not matching the more severe earnings pressure that a very bearish view might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 15.1% per year contrasts with only 2% revenue growth, which fits with a bear concern that cost cutting and mix, rather than broad based top line growth, are doing a lot of the work.</li> <li>The unstable dividend and leverage risk do not show up directly in the half year income statement, yet they sit in the background when you weigh how sustainable a 1.8% margin and 8.8% earnings growth might be if the auto cycle or regulation turns less helpful.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are weighing those balance sheet and revenue risks against</p>Next Steps\n<p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/trzoo1aa-analysts-raise-opmobility-price-target-citing-stable-margins-and-improved-risk-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OPmobility on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of optimism and concern feels finely balanced, now is a good time to look through the numbers yourself and stress test your view.

The company has seen revenue shift from €1.13 billion in the first half of FY 2024 to €1.48 billion in the second half of FY 2024, before landing at €859.8 million in the first half of FY 2025. Basic EPS moved from a €6.01 loss to a €28.88 loss over FY 2024 and then to a €4.63 loss in the latest period, leaving the story centered on pressure at the earnings line and the strain that puts on margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/real-estate-management-and-development/epa-areit/altareit-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Altareit.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings print lines up with the widely held narratives around Altareit’s trajectory, and where the data may support or challenge those views.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?
