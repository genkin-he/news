Steelmaking is one of the more carbon intensive sectors, so public funding for low carbon production technologies is becoming an important theme for policymakers and large emitters alike.</p> <p>For investors, the new funding round raises questions around execution timelines, capital needs, and potential long term cost structures for cleaner steel. It also puts Salzgitter more clearly on the map in discussions about supply chains for low carbon materials and the role of policy support in reshaping heavy industry.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/materials/etr-szg/salzgitter-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Salzgitter</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

For you as an investor, that means a larger share of the upfront risk is being absorbed by the state rather than solely through Salzgitter's balance sheet or potential equity dilution. With European Commission approval already in place, regulatory risk around state aid also looks more contained, which can matter for long lead time industrial projects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Salzgitter Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The extra funding directly backs the green steel and SALCOS initiatives mentioned in the narrative, supporting the idea that regulatory support could underpin more stable margins and potential green premium pricing.</li> <li>Execution risk around restructuring and large capex, already flagged in the narrative, could still challenge the medium term earnings bridge if project costs rise or timelines slip, even with public money covering more than half the budget.</li> <li>The targeted 95% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions at full build out and the link to carbon border costs for global buyers are not fully captured in the existing storyline and could influence long term demand from customers focused on low CO₂ steel.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/n9cl0o1c-szg-future-gains-will-depend-on-european-flat-rolled-steel-price-trends\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Salzgitter</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Large, multi year capex still needs to be executed on time and on budget, and any setbacks could strain cash flow or require additional funding.</li> <li>⚠️ Competition from other European and global steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp, many of which are pursuing their own low CO₂ projects, may limit pricing power for green steel if supply grows faster than demand.</li> <li>🎁 Public funds covering more than half of the planned Salcos spend ease the financial burden on Salzgitter and support its position in low carbon steel as carbon regulation and customer requirements tighten.</li> <li>🎁 If buyers start to factor carbon border costs and emissions more heavily into sourcing decisions, Salzgitter's targeted 95% cut in direct CO₂ emissions could make its steel more attractive in global supply chains.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>You may want to watch how Salzgitter phases the remaining Salcos investments, including any updates on total project cost, commissioning milestones, and contract wins for low CO₂ products. Progress on securing long term offtake agreements with automotive, construction, and machinery customers will be important to see whether policy support translates into commercial traction. It is also worth tracking how peers such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp advance their own hydrogen or low CO₂ steel projects, as this will shape how differentiated Salzgitter really is.</p> <p>To stay informed on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Salzgitter, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SZG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Salzgitter</a> to keep up with the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For New Found Gold, this makes the balance sheet the key anchor, rather than current profits, given the company is still loss making with net income of CA$45.9m loss and no meaningful revenue reported.</p> <p>The contrast between looking cheap relative to a narrower peer set and expensive versus the wider industry highlights how much investors are paying up for New Found Gold compared to typical Canadian metals and mining names. If sentiment or project expectations shift, that P/B multiple is an area where the market could move closer to industry levels.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-nfg/new-found-gold-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 12.8x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, there are still clear risks, including New Found Gold’s CA$45.9m net loss and the potential for sentiment to weaken if exploration or project timelines disappoint.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-nfg/new-found-gold-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this New Found Gold narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF suggests more upside than P/B implies</h2> <p>While the current 12.8x P/B signals a rich price tag against the wider Canadian metals and mining group, our DCF model points in a different direction.

The reaffirmed US$0.53 dividend and 3.43% yield, backed by five years of increases, reinforces income visibility and does not materially change the near term catalysts, which still hinge on net interest income trends, credit quality and how closely results track the US$5.79 fiscal 2026 EPS estimate. Recent earnings show improved profit margins, but rising net charge offs highlight that credit costs are an active watchpoint. With the share price pulling back over the past week yet still showing solid multi year total returns, the dividend news mainly underpins confidence in the existing income profile rather than rewriting the risk picture.</p> However, rising charge offs and credit quality trends are information investors should be aware of.\n\nDespite retreating, Community Trust Bancorp's shares might still be trading 49% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ctbi/community-trust-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ctbi/community-trust-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CTBI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2d2e9153-70d6-4c75-b030-58fd1216bdc6/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CTBI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Four Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates span roughly US$50 to US$118, reflecting very different views on upside.

This suggests that momentum has been building rather than fading.</p> <p>If this board meeting has you thinking more broadly about power and infrastructure themes, it could be a good moment to look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as potential ideas beyond Meidensha.</p> <p>With the shares up strongly over the past year and trading slightly above the latest analyst target and intrinsic estimate, you have to ask: is Meidensha now fully priced, or could the upcoming board decisions create a fresh entry point?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 16x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a P/E of 16x, Meidensha sits slightly above the JP Machinery industry average of 15.4x, even though the shares are at ¥7,820, just above both the ¥7,600 analyst target and the ¥7,656.36 SWS DCF estimate of future cash flow value.</p> <p>The P/E ratio tells you how much you are paying for each unit of earnings and is a common yardstick for capital goods names like Meidensha. With earnings forecast to grow 3.59% per year and both revenue and earnings expected to expand more slowly than the broader JP market, the current earnings multiple suggests investors are paying up for a steadier profile rather than rapid growth.</p> <p>Where it gets more interesting is in the comparisons. Meidensha is described as expensive versus the Machinery industry average P/E of 15.4x, yet the same 16x multiple is flagged as good value versus an estimated fair P/E of 18.3x and a much higher peer average of 35.4x. If the market eventually shifts closer to that fair P/E level, it would imply more room in the earnings multiple than the industry comparison alone suggests.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6508/meidensha-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Meidensha</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 16x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, the board’s focus on officer changes and a possible dividend revision could reset expectations quickly if decisions differ from what the recent share price implies.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6508/meidensha-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Meidensha narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Paint a Slightly Richer Picture</h2> <p>The P/E of 16x looks roughly fair on earnings, but our DCF model points to a fair value of ¥7,656.36, slightly below the current ¥7,820 share price. That suggests the current move may already be pricing in a lot of good news.

The latest earnings beat and completed US$1.40 billion buyback support the near term catalyst of improving profitability and capital returns, but they do not remove the key risk that capital markets and leasing revenues could weaken again if macro uncertainty or transaction volumes slow.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement is JLL’s fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings release, which showed higher year over year sales and net income alongside strong EPS growth. For investors focused on catalysts, this result reinforces the idea that improved execution in investment sales, debt and equity advisory, and leasing can support earnings, while capital allocation toward buybacks may incrementally enhance per share outcomes if transactional markets remain supportive.</p> <p>Yet while recent results look encouraging, investors should still be aware of how sensitive JLL’s capital markets and leasing revenues are to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-jll/jones-lang-lasalle/9mfwc63m-expanding-recovery-and-ai-integration-will-reshape-us-real-estate-markets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Jones Lang LaSalle (it's free!)</a></p><p>Jones Lang LaSalle's narrative projects $31.5 billion revenue and $1.0 billion earnings by 2028.

The latest quarter, with US$219.2 million in revenue modestly lower year on year but far ahead of expectations, reinforces the near term catalyst that matters most: evidence that the firm can beat a conservative profit bar even when activity is mixed. That sits alongside a still-young management team, a relatively high earnings multiple, and recent share price weakness despite an earnings beat, which together sharpen the risk that sentiment can swing quickly if deal flow or margins soften. For now, the new results look more sentiment reset than thesis changer.</p> However, one key risk around valuation and execution is easy to miss at first glance.\n\nPerella Weinberg Partners' share price has been on the slide but might be dropping deeper into value territory. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-pwp/perella-weinberg-partners/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out whether it's a bargain at this price</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nasdaq-pwp/perella-weinberg-partners\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PWP 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a24e2b09-9cf0-4c00-b003-7179c869df72/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PWP 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value from the Simply Wall St Community clusters at US$25.63, suggesting a tight, optimistic view.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Aichi Steel (TSE:5482) has put corporate governance in focus after its February 27 board meeting, where directors backed a shift to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, pending shareholder approval in June.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Aichi Steel.</a></p> <p>The governance shift comes as the stock has been on a strong run, with a 1 day share price return of 4.32% and a 30 day share price return of 11.62%. The 1 year total shareholder return is about double and the 3 year total shareholder return is a little over 5x, pointing to momentum that has already reshaped how the market is pricing Aichi Steel’s progress.</p> <p>If these moves have you thinking about where else strong governance and execution could show up next, it might be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> as a way to surface fresh ideas beyond Aichi Steel.</p> <p>With the shares already delivering very large multi year returns and trading at about a 6% intrinsic discount, the key question now is whether Aichi Steel is still cheap or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred P/E of 19.1x: Is It Justified?</h2> <p>On the numbers, Aichi Steel is trading on a P/E of 19.1x, while our DCF work suggests the shares are at about a 94.5% discount to an estimated future cash flow value of ¥63,651.95 per share versus a last close of ¥3,505. That mix of a relatively high earnings multiple and a very large modelled discount is what many investors will want to unpack.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share. A 19.1x multiple effectively indicates how much the market is paying for each unit of current earnings. For a metals and mining name that is not a bank, this is a common way to benchmark sentiment around the earnings stream.</p> <p>However, Aichi Steel’s P/E of 19.1x is described as expensive relative to both the JP Metals and Mining industry average of 14.5x and a peer average of 11.8x. That suggests the market is attaching a richer price tag to its earnings than many peers. At the same time, our DCF model, which projects future cash flows and discounts them back to today, points to a very large gap between the current ¥3,505 price and a theoretical ¥63,651.95 value.</p> <p>Compared with industry and peer P/E levels, the premium is clear and sizeable. Any investor leaning on this multiple has to judge whether the earnings profile and recent profit growth justify paying more than the sector and peer norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 19.1x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh risks such as earnings not supporting a 19.1x P/E and any governance changes failing to translate into consistent operational discipline.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Aichi Steel narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests A Very Different Price</h2> <p>While the 19.1x P/E points to an expensive share price relative to industry and peers, our DCF model paints the opposite picture, with Aichi Steel at ¥3,505 compared with an estimated future cash flow value of ¥63,651.95. That gap raises a simple question: which signal do you trust more, the earnings multiple or the cash flow model?</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"5482 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/95517a98-2859-4939-b161-4c983a62acd9/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>5482 Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-5482/aichi-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out Aichi Steel for example</a>).

Discovery reports Basic EPS of US$0.29 and net income of US$727 million on US$37.3b of revenue, with management indicating that a single US$2.4b gain is a key part of that profit picture.</li> <li>Bulls argue that expanding use of franchises like Harry Potter, DC, Lord of the Rings and broader monetization of the content library can sustain earnings beyond this. However, the reliance on a large one off gain means investors have to separate recurring profitability from that US$2.4b boost.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative points to multi channel revenue from theatrical, streaming, gaming, merchandise and experiences as support for earnings, while the latest year still shows three loss making quarters at the EPS level.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view highlight international expansion and partnerships, but the mixed quarterly net income profile, with Q1, Q3 and Q4 all reporting losses, gives a more cautious backdrop for those long term assumptions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls who think the content engine can outgrow that US$2.4b one off gain may want to see how that optimistic storyline stacks up against the full set of assumptions in the dedicated bull case for Warner Bros. Discovery. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/nz06t2qq-global-digital-trends-and-evergreen-ip-will-transform-entertainment-qsri\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Warner Bros. Discovery Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>High P/E and modest growth forecasts</h2> <ul> <li>The trailing P/E sits at 96.1x compared with 37x for the US Entertainment industry and 39.9x for peers, while forecasts call for earnings growth of about 9.3% per year and revenue growth of about 1.2% per year.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that leveraging iconic IP and global sports plus cost discipline can support higher margins and cash flow. Yet the combination of a high P/E and modest growth expectations gives that story a relatively tight margin for error.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expecting roughly 9.3% annual earnings growth are effectively asking the current 96.1x P/E to be supported by mid single digit style earnings growth and low single digit revenue growth.</li> <li>At the same time, revenue growth forecasts of about 1.2% per year running behind broader US market expectations sit awkwardly next to a P/E that is more than double the industry average.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Debt costs sit against weak interest coverage</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts flag that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which is a major financial risk even though the company has reported US$727 million of trailing 12 month net income and positive EPS on that basis.</li> <li>Bears argue that heavy debt, rising content costs and streaming competition could compress margins further, and the weak interest coverage data point gives that cautious view solid grounding.\n    <ul> <li>The fact that interest is not well covered comes alongside a mixed quarterly earnings record for FY 2025, with three out of four quarters showing net losses even before extra items.</li> <li>Critics highlight that if earnings growth comes in below the roughly 9.3% forecast, the company would have less flexibility to handle interest costs that are already described as not well covered.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Investors who focus on balance sheet resilience and the risk around interest coverage may want to see how the cautious camp lays out its arguments in the dedicated bear case for Warner Bros.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Viavi Solutions' share price still lines up with its fundamentals, this article will walk through what the current market price might be implying about value.</li> <li>At a last close of US$29.71, the stock has recent returns of 7.9% over 7 days, 41.3% over 30 days, 63.7% year to date, 165.7% over 1 year and 177.4% over 3 years, compared with 91.2% over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage has focused on Viavi Solutions' position within communications test and measurement and its role in supporting network build outs and technology rollouts. This helps frame how investors might think about the business backdrop to these returns. Commentary has also highlighted how investors are paying closer attention to companies exposed to connectivity and network infrastructure, which can influence how the market prices risk and potential.</li> <li>Despite these share price moves, Viavi Solutions holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>, so we will look at what different approaches like P/E, multiples and cash flow based estimates suggest about the current price.

The idea is to estimate what all those future cash flows are worth in today's dollars.</p> <p>For Viavi Solutions, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $74.64 million. Analyst and extrapolated projections, provided in the model, run out to 2035 and show free cash flow estimates reaching $536.31 million in that year, all expressed in US$ and then discounted back to the present.</p> <p>Pulling those discounted cash flows together, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$29.42 per share. Against a recent market price of US$29.71, the DCF suggests the stock is around 1.0% overvalued, which is a very small gap and well within any reasonable margin of error.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Viavi Solutions is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher P/S multiple. In contrast, slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull that “normal” range down.</p> <p>Viavi Solutions currently trades on a P/S of 5.53x. That sits above both the Communications industry average P/S of 1.92x and the peer average of 2.91x, so the market is attaching a richer sales multiple than these broad benchmarks.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Viavi Solutions is 6.07x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/S might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Because it looks at these company level characteristics rather than just simple peer or industry comparisons, it can give a more tailored sense of what “fair” could look like.</p> <p>Putting that beside the current 5.53x P/S, Viavi Solutions is priced below the 6.07x Fair Ratio on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St's Community page you can use Narratives to write the story behind your numbers for Viavi Solutions. You can link your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast and fair value, then compare that fair value with the current price to help decide when to buy or sell. The Narrative automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. Different investors can, for example, plug in a more optimistic view closer to the US$26.07 fair value with higher assumed growth and margins, or a more cautious view closer to US$12.00 with tighter assumptions and a lower P/E, even though both are using the same company and data.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Viavi Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/VIAV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

These new data on izalontamab brengitecan and the regulatory progress for iberdomide add to its presence in cancer and blood disorder treatments, areas that remain central for many global drug makers. For investors, this kind of late stage pipeline activity is often considered alongside marketed drugs when assessing a broad biopharma story.</p> <p>Readers will likely watch for full Phase 3 results on izalontamab brengitecan, the FDA’s decision on iberdomide, and any updates on potential label scope or target patient populations. These events may shape how the market views Bristol-Myers Squibb’s longer term product mix and research focus, while the fundamental risks associated with drug development and regulation remain important considerations.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-bmy/bristol-myers-squibb/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back program reflects how retailers and brands are trying to keep customers engaged, and measurable performance marketing tools remain a key focus across the sector.</p> <p>The exit from Games Publishing removes a more content heavy, project driven activity from the NasdaqGS:ZD portfolio and aligns the company more tightly with its existing core operations.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>For Ziff Davis, RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back rollout looks like an attempt to steady the Tech &amp; Shopping segment after an 18% Q4 revenue decline linked to weaker search traffic and affiliate commissions. A guaranteed 1% cash back across more than 4,000 merchants, some funded directly by RetailMeNot, gives retailers a clearer, performance based offer and could help shift the business mix from pure traffic driven affiliate revenues toward more direct, relationship based marketing spend. That may matter if search referrals remain pressured or if competitors such as Groupon and Honey keep pushing aggressive offers to retailers and brands.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Ziff Davis Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on RetailMeNot and exiting Games Publishing aligns with the narrative that Ziff Davis is concentrating on higher margin, recurring digital services and performance marketing, in line with its emphasis on SaaS like and subscription based revenue streams.</li> <li>The weak Q4, flat to slightly negative near term revenue commentary, and Tech &amp; Shopping headwinds challenge the idea that all core verticals can easily support ongoing revenue and margin expansion without further pressure.</li> <li>The Guaranteed Cash Back program and the decision to fully exit Games Publishing, while retaining rights to potential future performance payments, add more detail on how management is reacting to traffic shifts and AI driven content changes, which is not fully captured in the earlier high level growth narrative.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/sxkxg2vh-cloud-based-solutions-and-digital-advertising-will-drive-future-markets-bs1w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Ziff Davis</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Q4 2025 net income fell sharply to US$0.37 million from US$64.09 million a year earlier, which shows how quickly profitability can compress when key segments weaken and one off items hit results.</li> <li>⚠️ The 18% revenue decline in Tech &amp; Shopping and management’s decision to defer 2026 guidance highlight uncertainty around search traffic trends, AI content licensing outcomes, and how quickly the company can adjust its model.</li> <li>🎁 Full year 2025 revenue of US$1.45b versus US$1.40b a year earlier, strong free cash flow, and US$174 million in buybacks, including 30.48% of shares repurchased since 2020, show that Ziff Davis is using cash generation to reshape its capital structure.</li> <li>🎁 Growth in Health &amp; Wellness, Connectivity, and Cybersecurity &amp; Martech, helped by AI powered data tools and increased pharma ad spend, suggests the company has businesses that are less dependent on search engine referrals than Tech &amp; Shopping.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>As a shareholder or potential investor, you may want to watch how quickly RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back program translates into steadier Tech &amp; Shopping revenue, especially if search referral volumes stay under pressure. The company’s ongoing talks around AI content licensing with large platforms could influence both traffic and monetization, so any updates there will matter. It is also worth tracking whether management continues to exit or shrink lower return activities, similar to Games Publishing, and how that affects margins and earnings over the next few quarters. Finally, with share repurchases already reducing the share count by more than 10% in 2025, future capital allocation decisions, including any extension of the buyback program, will likely remain a key part of the story.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Ziff Davis, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ZD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Ziff Davis</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
