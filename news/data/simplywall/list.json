Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Another way to think of that is that for every AED1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn AED0.21 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It hasn't been the best quarter for <strong>Victory Securities (Holdings) Company Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HKG:8540</a>) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time.    But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years).  In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 321%. Impressive!  So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> During the last half decade, Victory Securities (Holdings) became profitable.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Ever wondered if MP Materials is actually a bargain right now, or if the hype has pushed the stock above its true worth? You are not alone in wanting to know whether there is real value left on the table.</li> <li>The stock has caught plenty of attention this year with a remarkable 292.3% gain year-to-date and a striking 243.1% jump over the past 12 months. However, it did dip 7.9% in the last week.</li> <li>Recent headlines have focused on MP Materials' strategic supply agreements and its expanding role in rare earth magnet production, fueling investor interest and shifting sentiment. These developments have raised new questions about future growth and the company’s pivotal position in the US supply chain.</li> <li>Here is the catch: MP Materials scores just <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-mp/mp-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a> in our undervaluation checks.

This method relies on projecting how much cash the business will generate, then applying a discount rate to reflect the value of money over time and investment risk.</p> <p>For MP Materials, the DCF uses a two-stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s most recent Free Cash Flow was negative, at -$260.5 Million, highlighting short-term cash challenges. Looking forward, analysts project Free Cash Flow to improve, reaching $24.5 Million by 2027. By extrapolating further, estimated annual cash flows for 2030 and beyond are expected to hover in the $20 to $23 Million range.</p> <p>Based on this combination of analyst estimates and extended projections, the DCF sets an intrinsic value per share of just $2.32. Compared to the current share price, this implies the stock is trading at a massive 2,676.1% premium, meaning it is vastly overvalued according to this cash flow-based model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests MP Materials may be overvalued by 2676.1%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 847 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-mp/mp-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MP Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/759065da-3ba3-412e-8da7-bca6369af2fd/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MP Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-mp/mp-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for MP Materials.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: MP Materials Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio is often used to value companies that are not yet profitable, as it focuses on sales rather than earnings. This makes it a practical metric for MP Materials, which has posted negative free cash flow and earnings recently. This shifts the focus to the company’s revenue generation rather than profits.</p> <p>Generally, a company with stronger growth prospects or lower risks is afforded a higher PS ratio, reflecting investors’ willingness to pay more for each dollar of sales. Conversely, subdued growth or higher risk should limit the PS multiple to closer to industry norms.</p> <p>MP Materials currently trades at a PS ratio of 47.03x, which is significantly above both its industry average of 2.75x and the peer average of 0.72x. On the surface, this suggests the stock could be extremely overvalued relative to its sales.</p> <p>However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” measures what an appropriate PS multiple should be, based on a holistic assessment including growth forecasts, margins, risk profile, industry dynamics, and company size. This method goes beyond simplistic comparisons and provides a fairer picture of intrinsic value for unique companies such as MP Materials.</p> <p>MP’s Fair Ratio stands at 4.82x, which is dramatically lower than its current PS ratio of 47.03x. The large gap between these two figures suggests that even after accounting for company specifics, the stock is pricing in far more growth and profitability than the underlying fundamentals currently support.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nyse-mp/mp-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MP PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/759065da-3ba3-412e-8da7-bca6369af2fd/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MP PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1383 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your MP Materials Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there’s an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. Narratives are simply your story: the way you interpret a company’s future, turned into numbers—your assumptions about its future revenue, profit margins, and ultimately what you think a share of MP Materials is worth.</p> <p>Instead of relying solely on rigid formulas, Narratives connect your personal perspective on the company’s prospects with a financial forecast and a calculated fair value. This makes your investment decision more intuitive and meaningful. You can easily build and adjust your own MP Materials Narrative, or browse those shared by millions of investors in the Community section of Simply Wall St.</p> <p>This gives you the power to see how your expectations stack up, compare your Fair Value to the current market price, and make informed decisions about when to buy or sell. Narratives are automatically updated as soon as new news or earnings are released, keeping your analysis fresh and relevant.</p> <p>For example, some investors believe MP’s Apple and DoD deals will spark strong profit growth, assigning a fair value near the highest analyst target of $85. Others are more cautious due to rising risks and set their estimates closer to the lower target of $65. This demonstrates how Narratives help bring both optimism and skepticism into a clear investment decision framework.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for MP Materials? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-mp/mp-materials/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/759065da-3ba3-412e-8da7-bca6369af2fd/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Kubota (TSE:6326) is entering a new chapter as its Board of Directors has confirmed Shingo Hanada will take over as President and CEO starting January 2026. This leadership change coincides with the launch of the company’s next Mid-Term Business Plan and is accompanied by an extensive reshuffling of the executive team at the top.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6326/kubota-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Kubota.</a></p> <p>Recent board shake-ups and leadership changes have been unfolding against a backdrop of robust momentum in Kubota’s share price. The stock has climbed 9.47% over the last month and increased by 19.27% in the past quarter. These moves have helped drive a total shareholder return of 6.5% over one year and 21% over five years, which suggests renewed optimism about the company’s direction and growth prospects.</p> <p>If this wave of change has you thinking bigger, now’s a great opportunity to expand your outlook and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>This raises the key question: after such a strong run, is Kubota's growth potential already reflected in its share price, or does this leadership transition mark a fresh buying opportunity for investors?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 13.5x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Kubota’s shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.5x, sitting just below the Japanese market average and substantially below its peer group’s average.</p> <p>The P/E ratio is a widely used valuation tool that compares a company’s share price to its per-share earnings. For established industrials like Kubota, the P/E is especially relevant, as it reflects how the market values ongoing profit potential in a mature sector. With Kubota’s P/E noticeably lower than the peers’ average of 29x and right in line with the machinery industry average of 13.4x, investors may be weighing Kubota’s moderate growth outlook against recent earnings volatility.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when evaluated against its estimated “fair” price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1x, Kubota’s current P/E ratio underscores a significant discount to what the broader market could eventually price in if growth or profitability trends improve further. The discrepancy highlights both a cautious sentiment and upside potential should company fundamentals surprise to the upside.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6326/kubota-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kubota</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 13.5x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower revenue growth or unexpected shifts in the executive team could dampen the outlook and pose challenges to the current optimism surrounding Kubota’s valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-6326/kubota-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Kubota narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: What Does Our DCF Model Reveal?</h2> <p>While the price-to-earnings ratio paints one picture, the SWS DCF model looks at Kubota’s future cash flows to estimate fair value.

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Afrimat's Profit Performance</h2><p> We'd posit that Afrimat's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item.      Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Afrimat is showing <strong>2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 1 of those is significant...   </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Afrimat's profit.   But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   If Neobo Fastigheter doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.   </p><p> <strong>Note:</strong> we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-neobo/neobo-fastigheter-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Neobo Fastigheter</a>. </p> <h2>Our Take On Neobo Fastigheter's Profit Performance</h2><p> Because unusual items detracted from Neobo Fastigheter's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter.      Because of this, we think Neobo Fastigheter's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.

The last month tops off a massive increase of 250% in the last year.   </p><p> Even after such a large jump in price, Nelly Group may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 20.3x, since almost half of all companies in Sweden have P/E ratios greater than 24x and even P/E's higher than 36x are not unusual.  However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> Recent times have been quite advantageous for Nelly Group as its earnings have been rising very briskly.   It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The <strong>Icelandair Group hf.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ICE:ICEAIR</a>) share price has fared very poorly over the last month, falling by a substantial 27%.    The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 23% in that time.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Icelandair Group hf's P/S ratio of 0.2x, since the median price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio for the Airlines industry in Iceland is also close to 0.4x.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

The latest quarterly update confirmed steady revenue growth and highlighted continued investment in AI, but also revealed a meaningful dip in net income, making profitability trends the most important near-term catalyst, with wage and margin pressures remaining the top risk. On balance, recent news does not fundamentally alter these priorities, but keeps the spotlight on execution and margin sustainability.\n</p> <p> Among Cognizant’s recent announcements, the expanded partnership with Rubrik to provide Business Resilience-as-a-Service is especially relevant. As AI adoption broadens and clients’ operational risks rise, offerings that directly address data integrity and continuity could help Cognizant shift more business toward high-value, recurring revenue streams, supporting both the company’s growth catalysts and its focus on resilient margins.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be especially aware of ongoing wage inflation and staffing retention pressures, as these could quickly weigh on margins if AI-driven productivity gains do not keep pace with costs...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-ctsh/cognizant-technology-solutions/u8hfi0xz-large-deal-wins-and-ai-will-drive-momentum-despite-visa-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Cognizant Technology Solutions (it's free!)</a></p><p>Cognizant Technology Solutions is projected to reach $23.5 billion in revenue and $2.9 billion in earnings by 2028.

This signals the market currently values its earnings at a discount.</p> <p>The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings and is a key metric for oil and gas companies, whose profits can fluctuate materially with commodity cycles. A lower P/E may reveal the market expects slower earnings growth or heightened volatility ahead.</p> <p>Compared to the Canadian Oil and Gas industry average P/E of 12.4x and the broader peer average of 12.1x, Headwater Exploration’s ratio stands out as relatively cheap. It is also almost aligned with its estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio of 9.6x.

This marks a major swing highlighting the forecasted shift from losses to meaningful profitability.\n  </li> <li> According to the analysts' consensus view, this margin improvement is set against the backdrop of projected earnings growth to $19.8 million and EPS of $0.54 by September 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This turnaround is anticipated to be powered by steady revenue gains and cost control, helping net operating income outpace the pace of acquisition-related expenses.</li> <li>Margin guidance assumes disciplined capital management continues, with no major shocks from tenant transitions or unexpected G&amp;A inflation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Consensus narrative notes that a focus on secondary and tertiary markets, where leasing activity and property demand support higher occupancy, should help both margin expansion and long-term stability for shareholder returns.\n    <ul> <li>Maintaining above-average occupancy and smooth operator transitions are key consensus factors meant to underpin revenue and dividend growth in the years ahead.</li> </ul> See why analysts believe CHCT’s margin forecast could be a game-changer for the narrative: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Community Healthcare Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Reliance on Capital Recycling Adds Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li> One risk flagged in filings is that CHCT is funding planned $146 million of acquisitions by recycling capital from asset sales, rather than tapping equity or additional debt. Any delay or discount on asset sales could directly limit portfolio expansion and future earnings growth.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative highlights that this reliance on disciplined capital recycling over new borrowing is intended to optimize capital deployment now that interest rates are elevated, but\n    <ul> <li>Persistent dependence on asset sales brings execution risk, especially if proceeds fall short or are delayed, potentially impacting accretion to earnings and funds available for dividends.</li> <li>The current environment makes it harder to source quality acquisitions with attractive yields, intensifying the need to get capital cycling exactly right for growth to materialize as forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Gap: DCF Fair Value Versus Peer Discounts</h2> <ul> <li> Shares trade at $14.43, markedly below the DCF fair value of $59.85, and CHCT’s price-to-sales ratio of 3.3x sits below the US Health Care REITs industry average (4.8x) yet above that of its closest peers (2.7x), showing mixed signals for value-focused investors.\n  </li> <li> Analysts' consensus view points to the 17.9 price target, which is 20.9% above current levels, but flags that for this valuation to hold up, CHCT must reach $148.8 million in revenues and a forward PE ratio of 33.7x by 2028. This trajectory is only justifiable if margin and capital allocation assumptions prove accurate.\n    <ul> <li>The wide spread between fair value, analyst targets, and peer multiples creates both opportunity and skepticism. Value seekers are betting on a sustained turnaround, while doubters point to financial position and execution risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Community Healthcare Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own take on these results?

Beyond the analyst forecast window, cash flows are further projected by extrapolation, reaching estimates as high as $189.8 million by 2035, according to industry growth rates and Simply Wall St methodology.</p> <p>By discounting these future cash flows to their present value, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $16.81 per share. With the share price currently trading at a substantial 56.4% discount to this intrinsic value, the stock appears considerably undervalued based on its future cash flow potential.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Semrush Holdings is undervalued by 56.4%.

The P/S ratio allows investors to assess how much they are paying for each dollar of the company’s sales. This makes it particularly useful for growth-oriented businesses and for firms reinvesting profits back into expansion.</p> <p>Typically, higher growth expectations and lower risk profiles justify higher P/S multiples. Companies facing headwinds or with slower growth should trade at a lower P/S. Benchmarks help provide context but should not be the only consideration in determining a fair value for a stock.</p> <p>Currently, Semrush Holdings trades at a P/S ratio of 2.63x. This is below both the industry average of 5.24x and the peer average of 3.05x, suggesting the stock is trading at a discount relative to comparable software companies. However, Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” for Semrush is calculated at 5.07x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary metric that reflects not just industry and peer multiples but also incorporates Semrush’s earnings growth prospects, industry dynamics, profit margins, company size, and specific risk factors. This holistic approach provides a more tailored benchmark than simple peer or sector comparisons.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 5.07x with the company’s current 2.63x P/S reveals a meaningful gap. This indicates that Semrush Holdings could be substantially undervalued at present levels based on this comprehensive framework.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Semrush Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a short, structured way for you to clearly state your view on a company, describing the story behind its numbers and what you believe about its future revenue, earnings, margins, and ultimately its fair value.</p> <p>Unlike traditional valuation models, Narratives connect your perspective on Semrush Holdings’s business outlook directly to a financial forecast and a justifiable fair value. This makes it much easier to see <em>why</em> a company might be worth more (or less) than the current share price. Anyone can build a Narrative in minutes on Simply Wall St’s Community page, a platform used by millions of investors worldwide.</p> <p>Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by comparing your personal Fair Value (driven by your story, not just the default numbers) to the current market price, and they automatically update as new reports or news emerge. This keeps your investment view relevant and informed at all times.</p> <p>For example, some investors believe Semrush Holdings will unlock significant growth through AI-powered enterprise solutions, projecting a fair value above $13.00. Others remain cautious about competitive pressures and tighter marketing budgets, putting their fair value closer to $9.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Semrush Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
