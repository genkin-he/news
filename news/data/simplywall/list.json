The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis. In the very near term, the key catalyst is the upcoming Q4 2025 earnings release, while the biggest risk remains a sharp correction in charter rates if trade routes normalize or demand softens.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement to this dividend is the declared timetable for Q4 2025 results on March 5, 2026, which now lands just one day before the payout date. That puts the dividend, capital return story, and fresh earnings data right next to each other on the calendar, potentially sharpening investor focus on how effectively Global Ship Lease is turning its contracted backlog and recent fleet additions into sustainable free cash flow and ongoing shareholder distributions.</p> <p>But against this backdrop, investors should also be aware of the risk that tighter environmental rules could force costly upgrades or early scrapping of older ships...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-gsl/global-ship-lease/foinmbvw-midsize-container-ships-will-improve-efficiency-despite-market-headwinds-fx8t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Global Ship Lease (it's free!)</a></p><p>Global Ship Lease's narrative projects $621.0 million revenue and $270.6 million earnings by 2028.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the recent turnaround can point to Q2 to Q4 basic EPS between roughly US$1.01 and US$2.19 as evidence that profitability has held above early 2024 levels in recent quarters.</li> <li>The longer term decline in earnings growth rate, despite the strong trailing 12 month print, shows the bullish story is relying heavily on the latest year rather than a multi year pattern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong recent profits sit next to a weaker multi year track record, and that tension is exactly what many investors are trying to weigh up right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/INVA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Innoviva.</strong></a></p> <h2>One off gain inflates 65.9% margin</h2> <ul> <li>The reported 65.9% trailing net profit margin is much higher than the 6.5% margin a year earlier, and the data attributes a US$161.6 million one off gain as a key factor, so a large slice of the margin is tied to a single item rather than repeatable operations.</li> <li>Critics highlight that the very large year over year earnings improvement, described as more than a tenfold jump, is hard to treat as a new normal when:\n    <ul> <li>The one off gain of US$161.6 million fed directly into the trailing 12 month net income of US$271.2 million, which means a material portion of that profit is non recurring.</li> <li>The same data set shows analysts expecting earnings to decline by about 0.8% per year over the next three years, so the bearish view is that the spike in margins does not line up with the more muted outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>“Cheap” 6.5x P/E versus 19.9x industry</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$23.54, the trailing P/E of 6.5x sits well below both the reported US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.9x and a peer average of 17.7x, while the DCF fair value cited for Innoviva is US$53.96, which is much higher than the current price.</li> <li>What is interesting for the more cautious, bearish narrative is that this discount exists alongside softer longer term earnings trends and forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Earnings across the last five years declined at about 22.1% per year, even though the most recent trailing 12 month period shows very strong profit, so the low P/E is being judged on a high earnings base that includes a large one off gain.</li> <li>Revenue is forecast to grow at 9.5% per year, slightly below the 10.4% reference rate for the US market, which bears use to argue that the apparent valuation gap may be partly explained by more modest growth expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are weighing that low 6.5x P/E against the earnings record and forecasts, the community discussion is a helpful next step. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Savara (SVRA) is back in focus after the FDA accepted for review the biologics license application for MOLBREEVI to treat autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and granted it Priority Review with an August 22, 2026 action date.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Savara.</a></p> <p>The FDA news arrives after a mixed few months for Savara, with a 1-day share price return of 2.23% and a 7-day share price return of 4.37%. However, the 90-day share price return shows a 5.09% decline, which contrasts with a 1-year total shareholder return of 142.68%. This indicates that long-term momentum remains intact even as shorter-term sentiment has been choppy.</p> <p>If this kind of regulatory milestone has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">29 healthcare AI stocks</a> as another source of potential ideas.</p> <p>With Savara still loss making and trading at US$5.97 against an average analyst price target of US$10.81, you have to ask: is there genuine upside here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred Price-to-Book Multiple of 15.6x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a simple yardstick, Savara’s current P/B of 15.6x sets a high bar, especially with the company still loss making and generating less than $1m in revenue.</p> <p>P/B compares the market value of the company to the book value of its net assets, so a higher multiple usually reflects strong expectations for future value creation rather than current profitability.</p> <p>Here, the disconnect is clear: earnings are negative, losses have grown at around 20.3% per year over the past 5 years, and there is no meaningful current revenue. Yet the market is assigning a premium that suggests investors are heavily focused on future growth potential and the aPAP opportunity rather than today’s financials.</p> <p>That premium also stands out against peers. Savara’s 15.6x P/B is described as expensive versus both the US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x and a peer average of 12.1x, implying the market is paying a significantly richer multiple than is typical for the space.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 15.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the risk that the company remains loss making, with net income of $115.645m in the red and no current revenue base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Savara narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>With sentiment clearly split between the risks and the potential upside, it makes sense to act now and review the numbers for yourself, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If you are serious about sharpening your watchlist, do not stop at one stock story, use the Simply Wall St screener to uncover ideas you might otherwise miss.</p> <ul> <li>Spot potential value opportunities early by scanning companies on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> list that pair quality fundamentals with prices that may not fully reflect them.</li> <li>Strengthen your defensive side by reviewing companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> that score well on stability and downside protection.</li> <li>Get ahead of the crowd by checking the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undiscovered_gems\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473622/high-quality-undiscovered-gems/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">screener containing 24 high quality undiscovered gems</a> where strong fundamentals have yet to attract broad attention.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That 28.3% earnings growth compares to a 5 year compound rate of 3.3%.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this kind of earnings acceleration supports a stronger long term story, yet the data creates a mixed picture:\n    <ul> <li>The 28.3% trailing earnings growth and higher 2.5% margin line up with the bullish view that better efficiency and mix can support higher profitability over time.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus and bullish scenarios are still only assuming earnings growth in the low to mid single digits each year, which is much closer to the older 3.3% 5 year trend than to the most recent year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, that gap between the one year surge and the slower 5 year pace is exactly what bullish investors are debating in their forecasts for Ahold Delhaize, and it is unpacked further in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/nzlb4xbk-demographic-shifts-and-digital-expansion-will-create-lasting-value-sdn5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Steady quarterly EPS with same store sales around 3%</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly EPS stayed in a tight band between €0.60 and €0.65 while reported same store sales growth was 3.3% in Q1, 4.0% in Q2, 2.9% in Q3 and 3.2% on a trailing twelve month basis.</li> <li>Bears point out that this kind of mid single digit same store sales and stable EPS ties in with their concern about limited top line momentum:\n    <ul> <li>Forecasts for revenue growth of about 2.3% a year and earnings growth of about 4.4% a year are not far from what this same store sales range suggests and are slower than the Dutch market forecasts of 9.6% for revenue and 12.4% for earnings.</li> <li>This helps the bearish side argue that even with stable quarterly EPS today, future growth may be constrained by mature markets and rising competition in areas like online grocery and discount formats.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who see those growth forecasts as a ceiling rather than a floor are building their case around this slower profile, and you can see that laid out clearly in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/89uf5o5x-digital-competition-will-erode-market-share-and-raise-costs-6h5d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation gap and slower growth vs Dutch market</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 16.4x versus a peer average of 28.1x and an industry average of 18.8x.

Analysts provide specific Free Cash Flow estimates for the coming years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path. On this basis, projected Free Cash Flow reaches $209.8 million in 2030, with additional years beyond that also modeled in millions of US dollars.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $91.95 per share. Compared to the recent share price of US$7.35, this suggests the stock is 92.0% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CorMedix is undervalued by 92.0%.

It helps you compare CorMedix with other businesses that also generate earnings in the same sector.</p> <p>A higher or lower P/E often reflects what the market expects for future growth and how risky those earnings might be. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk can justify a lower one.</p> <p>CorMedix currently trades on a P/E of 3.56x. That is below the Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.89x and below the peer average of 9.43x. Simply Wall St also calculates a “Fair Ratio” for CorMedix of 15.70x, which is an estimate of what the P/E might be given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry because it adjusts for growth characteristics, risk and profitability instead of assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. When you compare CorMedix’s current P/E of 3.56x with the Fair Ratio of 15.70x, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crmd/cormedix/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/685f6325-478f-40e0-a3ef-c96a3dbd93d3/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRMD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $39.24 million.

This proprietary metric is designed to estimate a P/E that fits the company’s own profile, including its earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than just lining it up against broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 27.2x with the actual P/E of 45.1x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-inod/innodata/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/41bf15e3-3242-4c6d-9919-b776429a1740/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:INOD P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

It is widely used because it links directly to the earnings that ultimately support dividends and retained capital.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E partly reflects how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually comes with a lower P/E.</p> <p>First Financial Bankshares currently trades on a P/E of 18.77x. That sits above the Banks industry average of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.98x, which on simple comparisons can make the shares look relatively expensive. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might be reasonable given factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. For First Financial Bankshares, the Fair Ratio is 12.72x, which is meaningfully below the current 18.77x and suggests the shares trade richer than this model would indicate.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, you can set up a Narrative for First Financial Bankshares that connects what you believe about its business to a financial forecast and a fair value, then compare that fair value to the current price to help you decide whether it looks attractive or not right now. Narratives are easy to adjust and are updated when new information like news or earnings arrives, so your view does not stay stuck on old data. For example, one investor might see First Financial Bankshares as worth well above today’s price while another might see it as worth well below, and those different fair values sit side by side on the platform so you can judge which story you find more convincing.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for First Financial Bankshares? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FFIN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ffin/first-financial-bankshares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/71abcb0a-2e44-4d27-a548-476c3e10f599/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:FFIN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model. It updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive, and is available on the Community page where millions of investors share their own versions.</p> <p>For example, one National Energy Services Reunited Narrative might align with the bullish analyst fair value of US$30.00, built around confidence in hydraulic fracturing capacity and MENA contracts.
