            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>MBIA (MBI) has just closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$13 million and a basic EPS loss of US$1.01, alongside net income from ongoing operations showing a loss of US$50 million. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$26 million in Q4 2024 through US$33 million and negative US$43 million in early 2024 to US$21 million, US$15 million, then US$13 million in 2025. Quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$5.33 in Q2 2024 to losses of US$1.28, US$0.14 and US$1.01 across 2025, setting up a story where investors are likely to focus on how efficiently MBIA is managing its shrinking top line against persistent losses and what that implies for margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for MBIA.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to weigh them against the most widely held narratives around MBIA, to see which stories the latest results support and which ones the data starts to challenge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/4it2jeai-update-for-mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about MBIA</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e7562be9-1d4c-489e-b33b-f5446fff2d04/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Running losses still large at US$175 million TTM</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, MBIA reported total revenue of US$80 million and a net loss from ongoing operations of US$175 million, which works out to basic EPS of US$3.55 in losses.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about earnings reaching US$58.3 million by around 2028 with margins moving from about 188.2% in the red to 64.6% in the black, and the current loss profile sets up a clear test of that path:\n    <ul> <li>The last four reported quarters still show losses in each period, including US$50 million in Q4 2025 and US$62 million in Q1 2025, so any future profit story has to bridge that gap.</li> <li>At the same time, the data shows losses shrinking at about 4.2% per year over five years. This is consistent with a gradual improvement but still far from the earnings level implied in those longer term forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue growth vs flat outlook</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, revenue growth is described at about 8.4% per year. Yet quarterly revenue in the table runs from US$33 million in Q3 2024 to US$13 million in Q4 2025, while analysts assume revenue of US$90.4 million by 2028 that is characterized as fairly flat over the next three years.</li> <li>What is interesting for the bullish narrative is how that 8.4% revenue growth rate lines up with assumptions that revenue stays fairly flat, even as bulls expect higher margins to carry future earnings:\n    <ul> <li>The consensus narrative ties a lot of the potential upside to margin improvement rather than big new premium growth. This fits with comments about the insured portfolio running off and limiting future revenue expansion.</li> <li>Given that the insured par at National is described as shrinking and leverage sits at 23 to 1, bulls are effectively leaning on cost control and better outcomes on legacy exposures rather than a jump in top line to support those margin targets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how those margin assumptions stack up against MBIA's latest numbers, have a look at <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MBIA Bull Case</strong></a> for the full bull case.\n\n<h2>Premium P/S, mixed valuation signals</h2> <ul> <li>MBIA trades on a P/S of 4.1x compared with about 1.2x for the wider US insurance group and roughly 1.0x for peers. A DCF fair value of about US$34.47 in the supplied data sits well above the current share price of US$6.55 and the analyst price target of US$7.75.</li> <li>Bears focus on that valuation gap by pointing out that the premium P/S multiple is coming alongside negative shareholders' equity and ongoing losses, which leaves little room for disappointment if forecasts do not play out as expected:\n    <ul> <li>The company is still unprofitable on a trailing 12 month basis and has negative equity flagged in the risk summary, so the balance sheet is not yet reflecting the DCF fair value figure or the US$58.3 million earnings level assumed for 2028.</li> <li>With the analyst price target only about 18% above the current US$6.55 share price, skeptics can argue that the market is already cautious, even as the DCF fair value number suggests a much larger gap that depends heavily on that future profit recovery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical about whether those losses and balance sheet issues justify a premium P/S?

How effectively Capital Power balances this expansion with its carbon and financing risk profile will be central to how the current growth narrative plays out.</p> <p>But investors should also recognize that expectations around recontracting existing capacity at attractive prices may not fully account for...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Capital Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>Capital Power's narrative projects CA$4.1 billion revenue and CA$521.7 million earnings by 2028.

This article is designed to help you frame that question clearly.</li> <li>The stock closed at US$108.33, with a 1.8% decline over the last 7 days, a 17.4% gain over 30 days, a 30.1% return year to date, a 20.5% return over 1 year, a 120.6% return over 3 years and a 273.5% return over 5 years.

For Iron Mountain, this version of the DCF uses adjusted funds from operations as a proxy for free cash flow to equity.</p> <p>The model starts from Iron Mountain’s last twelve months free cash flow of about $1.54b, then uses analyst estimates for the next few years and extends them out to 2035. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $2.49b, with intermediate annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are either based on analyst forecasts or extrapolated estimates by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows results in an estimated intrinsic value of about $155.76 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$108.33, the model implies the stock trades at a 30.4% discount. On this DCF view, Iron Mountain screens as undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iron Mountain is undervalued by 30.4%.

It is especially handy when earnings can be affected by non cash items or accounting choices, while sales remain a cleaner top line measure.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/S ratio depends on how quickly investors expect sales to grow and how much risk they see in those expectations. Higher perceived growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tends to line up with a lower ratio.</p> <p>Iron Mountain currently trades on a P/S ratio of 4.64x. That sits below the Specialized REITs industry average of 7.56x and below the peer group average of 7.32x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for Iron Mountain is 5.32x, which estimates the P/S level that fits its earnings profile, industry, profit margin, size and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or industry averages because it folds in those company specific factors. With the current 4.64x P/S sitting below the 5.32x Fair Ratio, Iron Mountain appears undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This shows how two investors looking at the same business, from legacy storage risk on one side to information infrastructure opportunity on the other, can reach very different yet clearly framed views.</p> <p>For Iron Mountain, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Iron Mountain Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/xn8xw1oo-legacy-data-management-with-optionality-in-digital-and-infrastructure-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iron Mountain Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 32.3% below the narrative fair value based on the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: very large, reflecting a multi fold increase from the current base</p> <ul> <li>Frames Iron Mountain as a global information management REIT with deep exposure to regulated sectors like healthcare, financial services and government, where compliance needs and high switching costs support long contracts.</li> <li>Sees the combination of sticky physical storage and expanding digital and data center services as a hybrid model, with legacy assets supplying cash and newer offerings adding optionality and new revenue pillars.</li> <li>Argues that as customers upgrade infrastructure and refine data governance, Iron Mountain’s focus on secure colocation, digital transformation and lifecycle management can support meaningful growth in information infrastructure services.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/a5ubyqkq-falling-legacy-demand-will-burden-data-center-margins-1jbl?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iron Mountain Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$65.53</p> <p>Implied downside to this fair value: 38.4% below the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 9.19%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights the risk that faster cloud adoption and digital transformation reduce demand for legacy physical storage, while tougher competition and higher costs in data centers pressure margins.</li> <li>Points to ongoing capital needs, sustainability requirements and potential commoditization in data centers as factors that could strain free cash flow, leverage and pricing power over time.</li> <li>Bases its lower fair value on analyst assumptions for mid single digit revenue growth, higher future profit margins and a lower future P/E, arguing that current market expectations may already be demanding.</li> </ul> <p>If seeing both sides laid out like this helps you clarify your own view, the next step is to go straight to the full narratives, compare the assumptions with your expectations for Iron Mountain and decide which story feels closer to how you think the business can perform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Iron Mountain? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/IRM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over the past four reported quarters, revenue has ranged from US$3.7b to US$4.7b, while quarterly basic EPS has swung between a profit of US$1.59 and a loss of US$3.92. This sets up a mixed backdrop for a business that is still loss making on a TTM basis but is being assessed on strong earnings growth forecasts. Overall, the latest numbers keep the spotlight squarely on how quickly Flutter can tighten margins and move its TTM EPS closer to breakeven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Flutter Entertainment.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the table, the next step is to set these results against the widely followed narratives around Flutter's growth, profitability path, and risk profile to see which views are supported by the numbers and which ones get pushed back.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Flutter Entertainment</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-flut/flutter-entertainment/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb59a032-5d0c-48c8-83f7-3e6b451467f1/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:FLUT Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Revenue climbs to US$4.7b, but profits still swing around</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly revenue moved between US$3.7b and US$4.7b, yet net income ranged from a profit of US$283 million in Q1 to a loss of US$690 million in Q3, showing that earnings are still quite sensitive even at higher sales levels.</li> <li>Bulls point to forecast revenue growth of about 10.9% a year and expected earnings growth of 42.6% a year as signs that this volatility could settle into a clearer path to profit, but the latest trailing 12 month loss of US$310 million keeps the bullish case tied to future execution rather than current profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters highlight that losses have been reduced over the past five years at around 2.9% a year, while revenue has reached US$16.4b on a trailing 12 month basis.</li> <li>At the same time, a TTM basic EPS loss of US$1.75 shows that, for now, the bullish view leans heavily on those forward growth assumptions rather than on the most recent earnings line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that these swings are the growing pains of a business building scale, and they focus on the earnings growth forecasts rather than the latest loss. It can therefore be helpful to see how that story is laid out in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/twh67x98-update-for-flutter-entertainment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Flutter Entertainment Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Unprofitable today, but forecasts point to a turnaround</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Flutter reported revenue of US$16.4b with net income of US$310 million in losses, and consensus forecasts in the data expect the company to become profitable within roughly three years if the projected 42.6% yearly earnings growth plays out.</li> <li>Bears focus on the fact that the business is still loss making, arguing that ongoing spending such as the US$200 million to US$300 million planned for FanDuel Predict in 2026 could hold back margin progress even if revenue keeps growing near the forecast 10.9% rate.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also point to recent impairments, such as the US$556 million non cash charge in India referenced in the cautious narrative, as an example of how regulatory decisions can quickly affect earnings and capital allocation.</li> <li>Set against this, the TTM loss of US$310 million is smaller than the US$950 million loss shown for the TTM period ending Q3 2024, which suggests some progress, but it does not remove the bearish concern that profitability is still a work in progress.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that as long as Flutter is loss making on a trailing basis, every new investment and regulatory change matters for the pace of any future turnaround.

By contrast, the bearish narrative stresses that trailing unprofitability and earnings quality concerns mean those valuation gaps are only meaningful if the forecast earnings growth and path to profit actually show up in future reported numbers.\n    <ul> <li>On the reward side, the risks and rewards summary highlights forecast revenue growth slightly ahead of the broader US market at 10.9% and a possible move into profit within three years, which is what underpins both the DCF model and the analyst target of US$253.30.</li> <li>On the risk side, the same summary flags that margins and historical earnings quality are still limited by the current loss making status, so investors weighing the discount to DCF fair value and targets are effectively being asked to judge how comfortable they are with that trade off.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/63cgf9ms-flut-recent-prediction-market-volatility-will-unlock-buying-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Flutter Entertainment on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If the mix of bullish and cautious views still feels unresolved, now is a good moment to check the data yourself and decide where you stand.

The latest tariff shock adds volatility but does not directly change the near term focus on stabilizing Search and reigniting growth at Care.com. The biggest risk right now remains pressure on traffic and monetization across key brands, especially as Google driven sessions and click through rates evolve.</p> <p>The most relevant recent update here is IAC’s Q4 and full year 2025 results, which showed lower annual sales of US$2,393.19 million and a narrowed net loss of US$104.03 million. Against the backdrop of tariff driven stock pressure and segment revenue declines, those numbers keep investor attention squarely on whether cost discipline and portfolio mix can offset weaker Search and Care.com trends while the company continues its share repurchase program.</p> <p>Yet behind IAC’s diversified story, investors should recognize how much long term value still hinges on concentrated traffic and advertising risks...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac/t7nuw899-iac-share-repurchases-and-asset-sales-will-unlock-long-term-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on IAC (it's free!)</a></p><p>IAC's narrative projects $2.5 billion revenue and $85.5 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac/t7nuw899-iac-share-repurchases-and-asset-sales-will-unlock-long-term-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how IAC's forecasts yield a $47.33 fair value</a>, a 24% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"IAC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d51956b7-dbbc-4422-866d-da9fa4000e45/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>IAC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting IAC to reach about US$2.5 billion of revenue and US$238 million of earnings, yet the latest tariff shock and AI driven search risk they highlight could push both bullish and cautious views to reassess how secure those targets really are and what that means for you as a shareholder.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on IAC</a> - why the stock might be worth just $47.33!</p><h2>Form Your Own Verdict</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your IAC research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-iac/iac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free IAC research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate IAC's overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Contemplating Other Strategies?</h2><p>Every day counts.

This sits alongside the current €55.1 million loss on a sizeable €540.6 million revenue base, so optimists focus on the idea that a large existing operation has been slowly reducing its drag on the income statement.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to the pattern of annual loss reduction as a sign the model has been tightening over time, even though the latest trailing twelve month figures still show a loss.</li> <li>At the same time, the fact that revenue is already over half a billion euros while the company remains unprofitable challenges any bullish view that scale alone is enough to flip earnings quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, Azerion's mix of a sizeable revenue base and ongoing losses has led some investors to question how long it could take for that gradual loss reduction to materially change the picture for earnings focused portfolios. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/ENXTAM/AZRN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Azerion Group.</strong></a> <h2>Low 0.2x P/S against sector averages</h2> <ul> <li>The analysis data flags Azerion trading on a P/S of 0.2x, compared with about 2x for the wider European Interactive Media &amp; Services group and 3.6x for peers. This means the market is valuing each euro of Azerion's revenue at a fraction of the level implied for many competitors.</li> <li>Bulls often argue that a low P/S ratio like 0.2x on €540.6 million of trailing revenue leaves room for upside if profitability improves. That view, however, has to be balanced against the fact that Azerion is currently loss making and that the very low multiple suggests investors are already heavily discounting those revenues.\n    <ul> <li>The contrast between a sub 1x P/S and ongoing net income losses of €55.1 million means the valuation gap could be reflecting concern about how efficiently that revenue converts into profit.</li> <li>On the other hand, the size of the discount to industry and peer P/S levels is exactly what bullish investors point to as the potential reward if the income statement eventually lines up more cleanly with the top line.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF fair value far above €0.97 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The supplied discounted cash flow model points to a DCF fair value of about €5.52 per share versus the current share price of roughly €0.97. This is a very large gap between the model output and where the stock is actually trading.</li> <li>Supporters of a more optimistic stance see that gap as a key part of the bullish case. At the same time, the fact that Azerion remains unprofitable with a trailing loss of €55.1 million on €540.6 million of revenue is a clear reminder that any DCF output is being applied to a company that still needs to close the distance between its revenue and its costs.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish angle is that if the multi year pattern of around 4% annual loss reduction continues, the current price near €0.97 could already reflect a lot of pessimism compared with the €5.52 DCF fair value figure.</li> <li>The counterpoint is that as long as the income statement shows continuing losses, the market can remain cautious even when model based values point much higher, so the valuation gap and the loss profile have to be weighed together.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The key near term catalyst is how well new acquisitions integrate into that aftermarket cash flow engine, while the biggest risk remains its leveraged balance sheet. The latest guidance raise and defense strength do not materially change that risk profile, but they may reinforce confidence in the underlying cash generation story.</p> <p>The most relevant development here is TransDigm’s declaration of nearly US$10.00 billion in remaining M&amp;A capacity after three recent deals. That level of “acquisition firepower” directly ties into the company’s long running playbook of buying cash generative aerospace businesses to feed its aftermarket revenue base. It also interacts with leverage risk, because any sizeable dealmaking from this point is likely to be funded, at least in part, through additional borrowing.</p> <p>But while the acquisition story is compelling, investors should also be aware of how TransDigm’s already high leverage and interest costs could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-tdg/transdigm-group/f88hh54b-analysts-adjust-transdigm-group-outlook-amid-aftermarket-strength-and-softer-oem-demand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on TransDigm Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>TransDigm Group's narrative projects $10.8 billion revenue and $2.5 billion earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Solventum (SOLV) has just wrapped up FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$1.998 billion, Basic EPS of US$0.36 and trailing twelve month EPS of US$8.94, alongside a very large one off gain that helped push earnings up 224.8% over the past year. Over the last few quarters the company has seen revenue move between US$2.070 billion and US$2.161 billion, while trailing twelve month net income excluding extra items has shifted from US$479 million in FY 2024 Q4 to US$1.56 billion in FY 2025 Q4. This leaves investors focused on how much of that uplift is flowing through to sustainable margins versus one time items.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\"

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Trailing US$1.6b profit, but heavily boosted by one off gain</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Solventum generated about US$8.3b of revenue and US$1.6b of net income excluding extra items, with that period also including a very large US$1.5b one off gain that inflates the headline profit story.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that this strong trailing net margin of 18.7% sits alongside a five year EPS trend that has declined about 8.5% a year, which means:\n    <ul> <li>Bulls pointing to current profitability and a DCF fair value of about US$149.45 need to factor in how much of the recent US$1.6b profit is repeatable once the US$1.5b gain is stripped out.</li> <li>At the same time, the bullish view that efficiency programs and portfolio changes can support higher quality earnings is not directly confirmed or disproved by these figures, since the data shows strong recent margins but also weaker multi year EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Have a look at how bullish investors connect these numbers to their long term story for Solventum: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/qd1r9o06-update-for-solventum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Solventum Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Low 8.3x P/E and US$74.20 price versus US$149.45 DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>Solventum trades at about US$74.20 per share on a trailing P/E of 8.3x, compared with a DCF fair value estimate of roughly US$149.45 and peer and industry P/E averages around 33.5x and 30.9x respectively.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view that the stock looks inexpensive on several measures meets some pushback from the fundamentals, because:\n    <ul> <li>The big gap between the current price and DCF fair value is based on earnings that include the US$1.5b one off gain, so any comparison that uses trailing profit is sensitive to that single event.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 1.1% a year and expected earnings growth of 5.32% a year are both below broader US market expectations, which is a different tone from the idea that the business is on a strong structural growth path.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Interest coverage flagged as a major financial risk</h2> <ul> <li>Risk analysis highlights that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, even after a year in which reported earnings grew very sharply and trailing net margin reached 18.7%.</li> <li>Bears argue that this weak interest coverage, together with modest revenue forecasts, could limit how much the company benefits from cost savings and portfolio changes, because:\n    <ul> <li>Even with trailing twelve month net income of about US$1.6b, the fact that interest is still flagged as a major risk suggests a meaningful portion of that profitability is not easily available for debt service once you adjust for the US$1.5b gain.</li> <li>Bearish analysts also expect revenue to fall 1.9% a year and margins to narrow toward 4%, which, if they were to occur, would put even more pressure on interest coverage than the already cautious risk flag implies.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors focus on these pressure points to build a much more cautious case around Solventum's outlook: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/kjfk0l1t-update-for-solventum\" rel=\"noopener

However, locking in long‑term drilling support may marginally de‑risk execution and orebody knowledge, which matters for a company with no revenue, limited cash runway and a share price that has already moved very sharply higher.</p> However, investors also need to weigh how funding terms and limited cash runway could pressure future flexibility.\n\nMontage Gold's shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-mau/montage-gold-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how much higher they are than fair value</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-mau/montage-gold-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:MAU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b885ab19-30ec-490c-bf4b-165661c0cf33/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:MAU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Five fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly CA$4.90 to CA$49, underlining just how far apart expectations sit.

The affirmed US$2.21 quarterly dividend signals continuity but does not materially change the near term picture, where the key catalyst is evidence that margins are stabilizing and the biggest risk remains further strain from Medicare funding and utilization trends.</p> <p>Among recent developments, the ViVE 2026 presentation on health equity and digital initiatives stands out. These efforts tie directly to one of the few potential bright spots in the story: using data, automation and virtual care to improve efficiency and reduce waste. If effective, they could partially offset reimbursement and cost headwinds, which is exactly what many investors are watching for as they reassess the stock’s risk reward profile.</p> <p>Yet behind the steady dividend, there is a growing concern that persistent Medicare funding changes and higher care intensity could materially pressure earnings that investors should be aware of...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-unh/unitedhealth-group/uf7ivz2w-analyst-views-mixed-as-unitedhealth-group-price-target-rises-amid-improved-outlook-and-ongoing-challenges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on UnitedHealth Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>UnitedHealth Group's narrative projects $501.1 billion revenue and $20.0 billion earnings by 2028.
