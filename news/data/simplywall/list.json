Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Another way to think of that is that for every AED1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn AED0.21 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It hasn't been the best quarter for <strong>Victory Securities (Holdings) Company Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HKG:8540</a>) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time.    But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years).  In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 321%. Impressive!  So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> During the last half decade, Victory Securities (Holdings) became profitable.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.

The latest quarterly update confirmed steady revenue growth and highlighted continued investment in AI, but also revealed a meaningful dip in net income, making profitability trends the most important near-term catalyst, with wage and margin pressures remaining the top risk. On balance, recent news does not fundamentally alter these priorities, but keeps the spotlight on execution and margin sustainability.\n</p> <p> Among Cognizant’s recent announcements, the expanded partnership with Rubrik to provide Business Resilience-as-a-Service is especially relevant. As AI adoption broadens and clients’ operational risks rise, offerings that directly address data integrity and continuity could help Cognizant shift more business toward high-value, recurring revenue streams, supporting both the company’s growth catalysts and its focus on resilient margins.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be especially aware of ongoing wage inflation and staffing retention pressures, as these could quickly weigh on margins if AI-driven productivity gains do not keep pace with costs...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-ctsh/cognizant-technology-solutions/u8hfi0xz-large-deal-wins-and-ai-will-drive-momentum-despite-visa-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Cognizant Technology Solutions (it's free!)</a></p><p>Cognizant Technology Solutions is projected to reach $23.5 billion in revenue and $2.9 billion in earnings by 2028.

This marks a major swing highlighting the forecasted shift from losses to meaningful profitability.\n  </li> <li> According to the analysts' consensus view, this margin improvement is set against the backdrop of projected earnings growth to $19.8 million and EPS of $0.54 by September 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This turnaround is anticipated to be powered by steady revenue gains and cost control, helping net operating income outpace the pace of acquisition-related expenses.</li> <li>Margin guidance assumes disciplined capital management continues, with no major shocks from tenant transitions or unexpected G&amp;A inflation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Consensus narrative notes that a focus on secondary and tertiary markets, where leasing activity and property demand support higher occupancy, should help both margin expansion and long-term stability for shareholder returns.\n    <ul> <li>Maintaining above-average occupancy and smooth operator transitions are key consensus factors meant to underpin revenue and dividend growth in the years ahead.</li> </ul> See why analysts believe CHCT’s margin forecast could be a game-changer for the narrative: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Community Healthcare Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Reliance on Capital Recycling Adds Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li> One risk flagged in filings is that CHCT is funding planned $146 million of acquisitions by recycling capital from asset sales, rather than tapping equity or additional debt. Any delay or discount on asset sales could directly limit portfolio expansion and future earnings growth.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative highlights that this reliance on disciplined capital recycling over new borrowing is intended to optimize capital deployment now that interest rates are elevated, but\n    <ul> <li>Persistent dependence on asset sales brings execution risk, especially if proceeds fall short or are delayed, potentially impacting accretion to earnings and funds available for dividends.</li> <li>The current environment makes it harder to source quality acquisitions with attractive yields, intensifying the need to get capital cycling exactly right for growth to materialize as forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Gap: DCF Fair Value Versus Peer Discounts</h2> <ul> <li> Shares trade at $14.43, markedly below the DCF fair value of $59.85, and CHCT’s price-to-sales ratio of 3.3x sits below the US Health Care REITs industry average (4.8x) yet above that of its closest peers (2.7x), showing mixed signals for value-focused investors.\n  </li> <li> Analysts' consensus view points to the 17.9 price target, which is 20.9% above current levels, but flags that for this valuation to hold up, CHCT must reach $148.8 million in revenues and a forward PE ratio of 33.7x by 2028. This trajectory is only justifiable if margin and capital allocation assumptions prove accurate.\n    <ul> <li>The wide spread between fair value, analyst targets, and peer multiples creates both opportunity and skepticism. Value seekers are betting on a sustained turnaround, while doubters point to financial position and execution risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Community Healthcare Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own take on these results?

This approach is commonly used for growth companies, as it attempts to capture both current performance and future potential.</p> <p>For Semrush Holdings, the company reported free cash flow of $31.0 million over the last twelve months. Analysts forecast this figure growing to $75.1 million by 2026. Beyond the analyst forecast window, cash flows are further projected by extrapolation, reaching estimates as high as $189.8 million by 2035, according to industry growth rates and Simply Wall St methodology.</p> <p>By discounting these future cash flows to their present value, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $16.81 per share. With the share price currently trading at a substantial 56.4% discount to this intrinsic value, the stock appears considerably undervalued based on its future cash flow potential.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Semrush Holdings is undervalued by 56.4%.

The P/S ratio allows investors to assess how much they are paying for each dollar of the company’s sales. This makes it particularly useful for growth-oriented businesses and for firms reinvesting profits back into expansion.</p> <p>Typically, higher growth expectations and lower risk profiles justify higher P/S multiples. Companies facing headwinds or with slower growth should trade at a lower P/S. Benchmarks help provide context but should not be the only consideration in determining a fair value for a stock.</p> <p>Currently, Semrush Holdings trades at a P/S ratio of 2.63x. This is below both the industry average of 5.24x and the peer average of 3.05x, suggesting the stock is trading at a discount relative to comparable software companies. However, Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” for Semrush is calculated at 5.07x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary metric that reflects not just industry and peer multiples but also incorporates Semrush’s earnings growth prospects, industry dynamics, profit margins, company size, and specific risk factors. This holistic approach provides a more tailored benchmark than simple peer or sector comparisons.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 5.07x with the company’s current 2.63x P/S reveals a meaningful gap. This indicates that Semrush Holdings could be substantially undervalued at present levels based on this comprehensive framework.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Semrush Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a short, structured way for you to clearly state your view on a company, describing the story behind its numbers and what you believe about its future revenue, earnings, margins, and ultimately its fair value.</p> <p>Unlike traditional valuation models, Narratives connect your perspective on Semrush Holdings’s business outlook directly to a financial forecast and a justifiable fair value. This makes it much easier to see <em>why</em> a company might be worth more (or less) than the current share price. Anyone can build a Narrative in minutes on Simply Wall St’s Community page, a platform used by millions of investors worldwide.</p> <p>Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by comparing your personal Fair Value (driven by your story, not just the default numbers) to the current market price, and they automatically update as new reports or news emerge. This keeps your investment view relevant and informed at all times.</p> <p>For example, some investors believe Semrush Holdings will unlock significant growth through AI-powered enterprise solutions, projecting a fair value above $13.00. Others remain cautious about competitive pressures and tighter marketing budgets, putting their fair value closer to $9.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Semrush Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse <strong>BioInvent International AB (publ)'s (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STO:BINV</a>)</strong> business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment.   BioInvent International AB (publ), a clinical-stage company, discovers and develops immuno-modulatory antibodies for the treatment of cancer in Sweden, Europe, the United States, and internationally.    The kr2.0b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of kr429m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of kr292m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven.    Many investors are wondering about the rate at which BioInvent International will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?”  In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><p> According to the 2 industry analysts covering BioInvent International, the consensus is that breakeven is near.   They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of kr198m in 2026.   The company is therefore projected to breakeven  just over a year from now.    How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2026? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 51% year-on-year, on average,    which is rather optimistic!  If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/139682-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798510469\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BINV Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of BioInvent International's upcoming projects,  though,  take into account  that by and large   biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow.   This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for BioInvent International </a></span></p><p> Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. BioInvent International currently has no debt on its balance sheet,  which is quite unusual for a cash-burning  biotech,   which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity.  This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.   </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> There are key fundamentals of BioInvent International which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

In fact, HAKI Safety increased the number of shares on issue by 9.1% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares.  Therefore, each share now receives a smaller portion of profit.  To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to <em>per share</em> value.  Check out HAKI Safety's historical EPS growth by <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clicking on this link</a>. </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Is Dilution Impacting HAKI Safety's Earnings Per Share (EPS)? </h2><p> Unfortunately, HAKI Safety's profit is down 57% per year over three years.    The good news is that profit was up 2.6% in the last twelve months.   On the other hand, earnings <em>per share</em> are pretty much flat, over the last twelve months.      So you can see that the dilution has had a bit of an impact on shareholders.   </p><p> In the long term, earnings <em>per share</em> growth should beget share price growth.  So it will certainly be a positive for shareholders if HAKI Safety can grow EPS persistently.   However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit.  For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow. </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On HAKI Safety's Profit Performance</h2><p> Each HAKI Safety share now gets a meaningfully smaller slice of its overall profit, due to dilution of existing shareholders.      Because of this, we think that it may be that HAKI Safety's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     If you'd like to know more about HAKI Safety as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    For example, HAKI Safety has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs </strong>(and 1 which is concerning)</a> we think you should know about.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of HAKI Safety's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 26% shows it's noticeably less attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that MVV Energie's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of MVV Energie revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its low P/E, given they look worse than current market expectations.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-mvv1/mvv-energie-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for MVV Energie</strong></a> (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> If these <strong>risks are making you reconsider your opinion on MVV Energie</strong>, explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/206/big-green-snowflakes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of high quality stocks</a> to get an idea of what else is out there. </p></div>",

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Arjo to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Arjo's Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Arjo's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Arjo's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential!    On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Arjo has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore these.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Arjo's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in.  But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%.  For example, the <strong>Graphite India Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:GRAPHITE</a>) share price has soared 258% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.    And in the last month, the share price has gained 16%.      </p><p> Since the stock has added ₹14b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During the five years of share price growth, Graphite India moved from a loss to profitability.   That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.  </p><p> You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882655-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798692283\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:GRAPHITE Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies.  But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.  Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Graphite India's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">earnings, revenue and cash flow</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR).  The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, Graphite India's TSR for the last 5 years was 292%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Graphite India shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   That's including the dividend.    However, that falls short of the 31% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.       While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Take risks, for example - Graphite India has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Indian exchanges.</em></p></div>",

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.

Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Swedencare to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-secare/swedencare-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Swedencare's Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Swedencare's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Swedencare's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!      The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future.  At Simply Wall St, we have analyst estimates which <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-secare/swedencare-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you can view by clicking here</a>. </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Swedencare's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

The last month tops off a massive increase of 250% in the last year.   </p><p> Even after such a large jump in price, Nelly Group may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 20.3x, since almost half of all companies in Sweden have P/E ratios greater than 24x and even P/E's higher than 36x are not unusual.  However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> Recent times have been quite advantageous for Nelly Group as its earnings have been rising very briskly.   It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Nelly Group </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"pe-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/100601859-pe-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark-2/1761799324139\" width=\"1640\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:NELLY Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure> Although there are no analyst estimates available for Nelly Group, take a look at this <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>data-rich visualisation </a>to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Is There Any Growth For Nelly Group?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like Nelly Group's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 119% gain to the company's bottom line.   Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The <strong>Icelandair Group hf.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ICE:ICEAIR</a>) share price has fared very poorly over the last month, falling by a substantial 27%.    The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 23% in that time.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Icelandair Group hf's P/S ratio of 0.2x, since the median price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio for the Airlines industry in Iceland is also close to 0.4x.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",
