This dramatically outpaced the company’s 1% annualized earnings growth over the past five years.

This highlights a clear valuation discount for investors at the current share price of $36.24.</li> <li>The current comparison to sector norms supports the idea that, even with short-term profit boosts, the market awaits more consistent evidence of durable earnings before awarding a valuation closer to industry multiples.\n    <ul> <li>While discounted pricing can appear attractive, it underscores how investors tend to approach such valuations carefully when underlying profit drivers rely on non-recurring events.</li> <li>This context positions the present multiple as a potential opportunity or simply a reflection of ongoing skepticism related to earnings quality.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit.  Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Tamilnad Mercantile Bank</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/banks/nse-tmb/tamilnad-mercantile-bank-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:TMB</a>). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   Over the last three years, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank has grown EPS by 5.9% per year.   That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.   </p><p> It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth.   Our analysis has highlighted that Tamilnad Mercantile Bank's revenue <em>from operations</em> did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business.     While we note Tamilnad Mercantile Bank achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 7.7% to ₹31b.  That's encouraging news for the company!   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

So check Tamilnad Mercantile Bank's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/banks/nse-tmb/tamilnad-mercantile-bank-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">balance sheet strength</a>, before getting too excited.  </p><h2>Are Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?</h2> <p> It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners.  Tamilnad Mercantile Bank followers will find comfort in knowing that insiders have a significant amount of capital that aligns their best interests with the wider shareholder group.     Holding ₹7.2b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   At 9.1% of the company, the co-investment by insiders fosters confidence that management will make long-term focussed decisions.   </p> <p> It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest.  Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed.    Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Tamilnad Mercantile Bank with market caps between ₹35b and ₹142b is about ₹35m.  </p><p> The CEO of Tamilnad Mercantile Bank only received ₹7.8m in total compensation for the year ending March 2025.  First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders.   CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders.  It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally. </p> <h2> Should You Add Tamilnad Mercantile Bank To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> As previously touched on, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank is a growing business, which is encouraging.   The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, but the pleasant picture gets better than that.  Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least.     If you think Tamilnad Mercantile Bank might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/banks/nse-tmb/tamilnad-mercantile-bank-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company</a>. </p><p> Although Tamilnad Mercantile Bank certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

This jump was partly driven by a non-recurring $50.6 million gain, highlighting the boost from one-off items rather than purely operational performance.</li> <li>Supporting the narrative that operational momentum is strong, profit margins remain far above typical industry levels.\n    <ul> <li>The significance of the $50.6 million one-time gain means some of the headline profitability may not repeat, tempering optimism that all of the margin improvement is sustainable.</li> <li>It is noteworthy that even excluding the one-off, Solstad Maritime’s margin stands well above historic sector averages, keeping the underlying bullish case alive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rapid Five-Year Profit Growth Outpaces Market</h2> <ul> <li>Reported earnings have increased at 77.3% per year over the past five years, surging to 93.4% in the latest year, sharply ahead of both historical norms and the broader Norwegian market’s pace.</li> <li>This growth trajectory amplifies value-focused arguments, especially for those bullish on turnaround stories.\n    <ul> <li>With an 18.8% annual earnings growth forecast, Solstad’s story remains above the market average but below the 20% threshold, adding nuance to the bullish long-term view.</li> <li>At the same time, critics point to the uncertainty in maintaining such rapid expansion, especially as the one-off gain is unlikely to recur and ongoing growth forecasts have moderated slightly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Ultra-Low 3.1x P/E Compounds Valuation Appeal</h2> <ul> <li>Solstad Maritime trades at 3.1x earnings, compared to the industry average of 6.2x and peer average of 11.9x. The current NOK17.86 share price stands far below the DCF fair value of NOK145.54, illustrating a steep valuation discount even after its strong profit surge.</li> <li>The prevailing market view suggests this deep discount provides a margin of safety for investors willing to bet on continued profit delivery.\n    <ul> <li>Some of the appeal is cushioned by ongoing risks around non-recurring income and a financial position not rated as strong, which can justify lower market multiples for now.</li> <li>Still, trading below both sector peers and even analyst price targets adds to Solstad Maritime’s standing as a value opportunity, provided operational momentum continues.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This steep valuation gap and outsized profit margins mean investors watching for renewed sector momentum will be eyeing Solstad's operational follow-through in coming quarters.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/None\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Solstad Maritime</a> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Imerys (ENXTPA:NK) remains in the red, with losses worsening at an annual rate of 43.6% over the past five years. Looking ahead, earnings are forecast to climb 17.67% per year, and the company is projected to swing to profitability in the next three years. This growth is expected to outpace average market growth. However, revenue is expected to rise just 4.1% annually, trailing behind the French market’s 5.6% benchmark. As a result, investors are left to weigh turnaround potential against slow top-line growth and ongoing financial risks.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\"

10.6% in three years according to analyst projections, highlighting Imerys' potential for a dramatic turnaround from persistent losses to meaningful profitability.</li> <li>Consensus narrative notes that this margin expansion is expected to be driven by a combination of Imerys' innovation in high-value sustainable materials, ongoing operational efficiency measures, and the ramp-up of projects like EMILI lithium.\n    <ul> <li>Strategic focus on eco-friendly products and new applications such as minerals for battery storage and lightweighting is seen as key to driving pricing improvements and margin growth as end-market demand recovers.</li> <li>Cost savings from divesting low-margin businesses and securing favorable trade policies are regarded as bolstering competitive standing and maintaining resilient cash flows, which supports the case for a profitable swing.</li> </ul> </li> <li> The latest earnings reinforce analysts' case for Imerys as a margin expansion story, with the full consensus narrative explaining how profitability could ramp up as market conditions improve. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/drjq7bzf-emili-lithium-and-ev-demand-will-shape-future-markets-2jqx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Imerys Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>EMILI Project Raises Long-Term Risk Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The EMILI lithium project is facing commercial delays until at least 2030, with project CapEx increased by 80% to €1.8 billion and lithium prices needing to rise 30 to 40 percent just to reach break-even, casting doubt on near-term returns and straining Imerys' balance sheet.</li> <li>Bears argue that this creates multiple compression points for the stock, given how much of Imerys’ future growth is linked to the EMILI project's success. \n    <ul> <li>The combination of delayed market entry, elevated leverage at 2.5x EBITDA, and exposure to fluctuating commodity prices amplifies the risk of ongoing losses and limits the company’s credit flexibility for future initiatives.</li> <li>Critics highlight unresolved litigation in the US and dependency on European protectionist trade measures as further challenges, reasoning that any regulatory or market shocks could weigh on long-term earnings and dividend potential.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Discount to DCF Fair Value and Industry Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Imerys trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.5x, which is half the 1x industry average, and its current share price of €21.38 sits at a 37 percent discount to its DCF fair value of €34.22, signaling significant upside potential if profit forecasts are met.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view emphasizes that this valuation gap is underpinned by expectations for revenue to rise 3.6 percent annually and earnings to reach €405.1 million by 2028, with a target PE ratio of 7.4x that remains below broader European Basic Materials industry averages.\n    <ul> <li>One notable point is that, while the business faces structural headwinds, Imerys' favorable valuation compared to peers could attract investors focusing on a turnaround and eventual profitability.</li> <li>However, the cautious consensus highlights the need for confidence in margin forecasts and successful project execution, particularly as any setbacks could quickly erode the discount-based opportunity.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth,

This highlights a squeeze on profitability despite a strong long-term average earnings growth of 17.7% per year.\n  </li> <li> Margin compression stands out as a concern since bulls see past earnings quality as a bedrock for future growth, but the current figure grounds optimism:\n    <ul> <li>Margin pressure could test how well Nisshin Seifun Group can defend its earnings trajectory, especially as revenue growth of 1.6% per year is expected to lag the market average of 4.5%.</li> <li>Even with robust historic growth, headline margins matter given steady cost increases. Lower margin safety may limit flexibility for navigating future headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Sits Above Market</h2> <ul> <li> Nisshin Seifun Group’s share price of 1,741.50 trades at a discount to the DCF fair value of 1,930.82, and is also below the analyst target price of 2,125.00.\n  </li> <li> A significant gap between current price and fair value strongly supports the outlook of upside potential, but this discount must be weighed against the slower projected sales growth:\n    <ul> <li>Share price appears attractive versus both DCF and analyst targets, introducing a margin of safety for value-focused investors.</li> <li>However, since price-to-earnings multiples remain higher than peer and sector averages, the stock may be exposed if growth fails to outpace those expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Durability Faces Minor Risk</h2> <ul> <li> The sustainability of the dividend is noted as a minor risk in the latest filing, but there are no major flagged risks affecting core earnings or financial health.\n  </li> <li> While investors often depend on stable payouts in staple sectors, the combination of moderating profit margins and slowing sales raises questions about long-term payout sustainability:\n    <ul> <li>Still, the absence of significant risk warnings supports the case for ongoing resilience, especially given the company's record of high-quality earnings.</li> <li>With no immediate red flags, watchful investors may focus on whether margins can recover enough to support both growth and shareholder returns.</li> </ul> </li> <li> The latest numbers highlight tension between reliable income and profit pressures.

This could pave the way for smoother, more predictable cash flows as margins climb.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that if Quaker delivers this margin improvement, it could justify analyst projections for earnings to swing from a loss of $7.1 million today to $531.8 million by 2028.</li> <li>Consensus narrative also flags that this trajectory relies heavily on the success of streamlined operations and ongoing demand growth in the automation and greener industry segments.</li> </ul> See if the margin rebound will stick or fall short by reading the full consensus perspective and what could shift the margin story in our latest breakdown. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/iq9ih1og-sustainable-chemistries-and-asia-expansion-will-empower-manufacturing-automation-ko1p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Quaker Chemical Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2>Net Leverage Climbs to 2.6x EBITDA</h2> <ul> <li>After recent acquisitions, Quaker Chemical’s net leverage reached 2.6x trailing EBITDA, reflecting higher debt and adding financial risk to the equation.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that:\n    <ul> <li>Elevated leverage and increased interest expenses may restrain future investment and share repurchases. This tightens financial flexibility at a time when macroeconomic and regional challenges are already weighing on performance.</li> <li>A restructuring program is in place to lower costs, but this comes with elevated short-term spending. The path to healthier margins and more available cash could therefore be bumpy and drawn-out.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Shows Wide Gap at $255.48</h2> <ul> <li>Quaker Chemical’s current share price of $138.89 is well below the DCF fair value of $255.48, creating a significant theoretical upside even after factoring in its above-peer price-to-sales multiple of 1.3x versus the industry average of 1.1x.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights a tension:\n    <ul> <li>The apparent discount to fair value provides a cushion. However, analysts' consensus price target sits closer at $157.60, signaling cautious optimism that depends on positive earnings momentum materializing.</li> <li>Investors will need conviction not just on a discounted valuation, but also on whether revenue and margin gains can actually be delivered in a tough competitive and cost environment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iq9ih1og-sustainable-chemistries-and-asia-expansion-will-empower-manufacturing-automation-ko1p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Quaker Chemical on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different take on what the data reveals?

The recent strong revenue performance and upward revision of adjusted earnings guidance have shifted near-term sentiment positively, but the most important catalyst, Medicaid margin recovery, remains exposed to ongoing uncertainties in rate adjustments and medical cost inflation, while the biggest risk continues to be policy-related volatility. This news reinforces the business fundamentals, but policy developments could still play a material role in future earnings swings.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the updated full-year 2025 guidance stands out. Centene's move to raise its adjusted EPS outlook to at least US$2.00 per share directly supports investor focus on operational turnaround as a catalyst. This is particularly relevant given pressures from recent impairment charges and ongoing Medicaid rate discussions, signaling management's continued emphasis on restoring earnings quality and margin stability.</p> <p>By contrast, what may surprise some investors is the risk if enhanced premium tax credits are not preserved...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-cnc/centene/49m8wf4o-analysts-lift-centene-price-target-on-margin-recovery-but-warn-of-lasting-sector-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Centene (it's free!)</a></p><p>Centene's outlook anticipates $195.6 billion in revenue and $2.1 billion in earnings by 2028.

Earnings climbed 20.2% over the last twelve months, well above the company's five-year average of 10.7% annual growth, and earnings quality remains high. Despite this consistent historic performance, the stock trades at a significant premium, with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 23.6x, much higher than both peer and industry averages. The current share price of ¥9,710 also sits far above estimated fair value. Looking ahead, analysts forecast a decline in earnings of -1.7% per year over the next three years, with revenue growth expected to slow to 1.8% per year, lagging the broader Japanese market’s 4.5% rate. Investors face the twin challenges of high valuation and muted earnings outlook, though the company’s strong growth record remains a bright spot.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-1949/sumitomo-densetsultd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Sumitomo DensetsuLtd.</a> <p>The next section puts these numbers side by side with the most widely held narratives for Sumitomo Densetsu Ltd., showing where consensus matches up and where investor stories might get shaken up.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p><p> To get a sense of who is truly in control of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PRUDENT</a>), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business.  And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 58% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> As market cap fell to ₹106b last week, insiders would have faced the highest losses than any other shareholder groups of the company.    </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudent Advisory Services. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Prudent Advisory Services </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761972942585\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Ownership Breakdown November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudent Advisory Services?</h2><p> Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. </p> <p> Prudent Advisory Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudent Advisory Services' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761972943724\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Prudent Advisory Services is not owned by hedge funds.      From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Sanjay Shah (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 55% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.      Additionally, the company's CEO Shirish Patel directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.   </p><p> While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Prudent Advisory Services</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. </p><p> Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. </p> <p> Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company.   Given it has a market cap of ₹106b, that means insiders have a whopping ₹61b worth of shares in their own names.  It is good to see this level of investment. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check here to see if those insiders have been selling any of their shares. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.   While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. </p> <h2>Private Company Ownership</h2><p> Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 6.7%, of the company's shares.   It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. </p> <p> I always like to check for a <strong>history of revenue growth</strong>.

This would support sustainable growth even if the core market faces low or moderate expansion.</li> <li>Ongoing investment in automation, such as smart safes and digital monitoring, is expected to diversify revenues and enable margin expansion as Loomis competes for recurring, higher-margin business outside traditional cash handling.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Analysts see Loomis' bold profit margin goals as credible, but continued progress is critical as competition intensifies and sector headwinds persist. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/g0wxnuwh-high-security-logistics-and-automation-will-unlock-new-markets-uu36\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Loomis Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>EPS Set to Nearly Double by 2028</h2> <ul> <li>Earnings per share are projected to increase from the current SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 3.1 billion (SEK 40.29 per share) by September 2028, outpacing projected revenue growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags a constructive outlook for EPS growth driven by:\n    <ul> <li>Strategic expansion into higher-margin logistics and tech-driven services diversifies Loomis’ revenue, reducing reliance on mature cash-in-transit markets.</li> <li>Resilient demand in core markets, combined with operational streamlining and restructuring, underpins Loomis' ability to lift earnings even if underlying revenue trends remain only modestly positive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount: 70% Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>Loomis trades at SEK384, well below its DCF fair value of SEK1,285.80 and attractively below the peer Price-to-Earnings ratio (14.9x vs. 19.7x).
