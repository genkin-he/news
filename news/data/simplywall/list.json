That means that even when the share price was higher than kr20.85 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future.  In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important.   As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.     </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr5.6m for 254.99k shares.  But they sold 128.00k shares for kr3.2m.     Overall, ITAB Shop Concept insiders were net buyers during the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests.   Insiders own 12% of ITAB Shop Concept shares, worth about kr634m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The ITAB Shop Concept Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.    However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, ITAB Shop Concept insiders feel good about the company's future.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing ITAB Shop Concept.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if DXC Technology is a bargain right now? Let’s take a closer look beneath the headlines to see if this stock could be flying under the radar.</li> <li>Despite a rough patch, shares have dropped 3.2% in the past week, are down 5.1% over the past month, and have fallen an eye-catching 34.5% so far this year. Investors are curious if this signals greater risk or uncovers an opportunity.</li> <li>These declines follow several headlines about DXC Technology’s ongoing strategic shifts and industry partnerships, both of which have stirred up speculation about the company’s future direction. Significant organizational changes and sector trends have added more complexity to the story, fueling both skepticism and hope in the market.</li> <li>Right now, DXC Technology scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> on our undervaluation checks.

This approach aims to reveal what a business is really worth today, based solely on its ability to generate cash in the future.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology’s current Free Cash Flow sits at approximately $909.5 Million. Analysts provide direct projections for the next five years, and thereafter, Simply Wall St extrapolates further using reasonable industry estimates. By 2027, forecasted Free Cash Flow is around $650.43 Million, with a ten-year projection pointing to roughly $514.09 Million by 2035. Despite a moderate decline over time, these numbers show a steady cash-generating foundation.\n</p> <p> According to the DCF model using these cash flow estimates, the fair value per share comes out to $27.43. This is 52.8% higher than the current share price. This suggests the stock is significantly undervalued by the market.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests DXC Technology is undervalued by 52.8%.

Since it compares a company’s current share price against its earnings per share, the PE ratio gives investors a quick sense of how the market is valuing its profitability.\n</p> <p> Of course, what qualifies as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors. Companies with faster earnings growth or lower risk typically deserve higher PE ratios, while those facing slower growth or more uncertainty tend to trade on lower multiples.\n</p> <p> DXC Technology currently trades at a PE ratio of just 6.1x. This stands out sharply against the Information Technology industry average of 29.3x and the average among direct peers at 20.7x. Such a discount hints that investors may have concerns, but it could also point to untapped value.\n</p> <p> Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” for DXC Technology is 18.7x. The Fair Ratio is calculated with a more holistic view than just industry or peer averages. It factors in the company’s unique risk profile, growth prospects, profit margins, and market capitalization, offering a more comprehensive indication of a reasonable valuation multiple for this business specifically.\n</p> <p> When we compare DXC Technology’s actual PE of 6.1x to its Fair Ratio of 18.7x, the shares look strongly undervalued in a multiple-based evaluation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:DXC PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/01cae35e-7765-4441-9380-6df0f878fcc2/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:DXC PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1405 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your DXC Technology Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personalized investment story, where you combine your outlook on a company, such as its future revenue, earnings, and margins, with what you believe to be its fair value based on your own reasoning or research.\n</p> <p> Narratives bridge the gap between stories and spreadsheets, linking your perspective about DXC Technology’s business prospects directly to a financial forecast and a resulting fair value estimate. Best of all, Narratives are designed to be easy to use and are available for everyone on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share their views.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly determine whether now might be a good time to buy or sell by comparing your Fair Value to the current Price, helping you make decisions based on your specific expectations rather than just the market consensus or analyst targets.\n</p> <p> Because Narratives update automatically when new news or earnings reports are released, your investment thesis stays fresh and relevant as the situation changes. For example, some investors see strong AI and cloud partnerships as reasons to assign a fair value of $18.00 per share, while cautious investors note ongoing revenue declines and set their fair value at just $14.00. This demonstrates how Narrative tools empower you to act on the view that fits you best.\n</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for DXC Technology? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-dxc/dxc-technology/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/01cae35e-7765-4441-9380-6df0f878fcc2/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:DXC Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

One possibility is that the P/S is low because investors think this respectable revenue growth might actually underperform the broader industry in the near future.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.    </p> Although there are no analyst estimates available for Erika Carmel-Tech, take a look at this <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>data-rich visualisation </a>to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> Is There Any Revenue Growth Forecasted For Erika Carmel-Tech?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the industry for P/S ratios like Erika Carmel-Tech's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> If we review the last year of revenue growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 21%.   Still, revenue has fallen 47% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing.  Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the industry, which is predicted to deliver 21% growth in the next 12 months, the company's downward momentum based on recent medium-term revenue results is a sobering picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, we think shrinking revenues are unlikely to lead to a stable P/S over the longer term, which could set up shareholders for future disappointment.  There's potential for the P/S to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its top-line growth.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Erika Carmel-Tech's P/S? </h2><p> Erika Carmel-Tech's stock price has surged recently, but its but its P/S still remains modest.      Using the price-to-sales ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> Our examination of Erika Carmel-Tech confirms that the company's shrinking revenue over the past medium-term is a key factor in its low price-to-sales ratio, given the industry is projected to grow.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio.  Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Before you take the next step, you should know about the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/healthcare/tase-erka/erika-carmel-tech-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for Erika Carmel-Tech</strong></a> that we have uncovered.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Erika Carmel-Tech's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.  While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> collection of companies boasting high return on equity</a>, or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> this list of stocks with significant insider holdings</a> to be useful.  </p></div>",

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.    However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For Yoram Naveh Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> According to our data, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has a market capitalization of ₪15b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth ₪3.3m over the year to December 2024.   That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!      We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this more detailed historical graph</a> of earnings, revenue and cash flow.  </p> <h2>Has Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.  That's why we did some digging and identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings</strong></a> that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a different set of stocks.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of interesting companies. </a> </p></div>",

Recent large data center wins and a robust order funnel highlight this trend.
