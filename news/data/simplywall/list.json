            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse <strong>BioInvent International AB (publ)'s (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">STO:BINV</a>)</strong> business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment.   BioInvent International AB (publ), a clinical-stage company, discovers and develops immuno-modulatory antibodies for the treatment of cancer in Sweden, Europe, the United States, and internationally.    The kr2.0b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of kr429m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of kr292m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven.    Many investors are wondering about the rate at which BioInvent International will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?”  In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><p> According to the 2 industry analysts covering BioInvent International, the consensus is that breakeven is near.   They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of kr198m in 2026.   The company is therefore projected to breakeven  just over a year from now.    How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2026? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 51% year-on-year, on average,    which is rather optimistic!  If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/139682-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798510469\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BINV Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of BioInvent International's upcoming projects,  though,  take into account  that by and large   biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow.   This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for BioInvent International </a></span></p><p> Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. BioInvent International currently has no debt on its balance sheet,  which is quite unusual for a cash-burning  biotech,   which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity.  This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden. This aspect reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.   </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> There are key fundamentals of BioInvent International which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

In fact, HAKI Safety increased the number of shares on issue by 9.1% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares.  Therefore, each share now receives a smaller portion of profit.  To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to <em>per share</em> value.  Check out HAKI Safety's historical EPS growth by <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clicking on this link</a>. </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Is Dilution Impacting HAKI Safety's Earnings Per Share (EPS)? </h2><p> Unfortunately, HAKI Safety's profit is down 57% per year over three years.    The good news is that profit was up 2.6% in the last twelve months.   On the other hand, earnings <em>per share</em> are pretty much flat, over the last twelve months.      So you can see that the dilution has had a bit of an impact on shareholders.   </p><p> In the long term, earnings <em>per share</em> growth should beget share price growth.  So it will certainly be a positive for shareholders if HAKI Safety can grow EPS persistently.   However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit.  For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow. </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On HAKI Safety's Profit Performance</h2><p> Each HAKI Safety share now gets a meaningfully smaller slice of its overall profit, due to dilution of existing shareholders.      Because of this, we think that it may be that HAKI Safety's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     If you'd like to know more about HAKI Safety as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    For example, HAKI Safety has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs </strong>(and 1 which is concerning)</a> we think you should know about.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of HAKI Safety's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 26% shows it's noticeably less attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that MVV Energie's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of MVV Energie revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its low P/E, given they look worse than current market expectations.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-mvv1/mvv-energie-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for MVV Energie</strong></a> (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> If these <strong>risks are making you reconsider your opinion on MVV Energie</strong>, explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/206/big-green-snowflakes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of high quality stocks</a> to get an idea of what else is out there. </p></div>",

We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.

Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Arjo's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential!    On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During the five years of share price growth, Graphite India moved from a loss to profitability.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, Graphite India's TSR for the last 5 years was 292%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Graphite India shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   That's including the dividend.    However, that falls short of the 31% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.       While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Take risks, for example - Graphite India has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Indian exchanges.</em></p></div>",

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.

Because of this, we think Neobo Fastigheter's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 23% in that time.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Icelandair Group hf's P/S ratio of 0.2x, since the median price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio for the Airlines industry in Iceland is also close to 0.4x.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

The early response was not positive, with shares down 2.3% to ₹356 in the past week.       It was a pretty negative result overall, with revenues of ₹17b missing analyst predictions by 2.0%. Worse, the business reported a statutory loss of ₹1.20 per share, a substantial decline on analyst expectations of a profit.     Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

If met, it would imply a decent 8.2% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Mahindra Logistics is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of ₹7.42 per share.       In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ₹70.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹7.08 in 2026.        So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential following these results.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/transportation/nse-mahlog/mahindra-logistics-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Mahindra Logistics </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 8.1% to ₹389, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Mahindra Logistics analyst has a price target of ₹560 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at ₹279.   This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Mahindra Logistics' past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/industrials/logistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's clear from the latest estimates that Mahindra Logistics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 17% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 14% p.a. over the past five years.    By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year.  It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Mahindra Logistics to grow faster than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.  </p><p> Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.   We have estimates - from multiple Mahindra Logistics analysts - going out to 2028, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/transportation/nse-mahlog/mahindra-logistics-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/transportation/nse-mahlog/mahindra-logistics-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for Mahindra Logistics</strong></a> (1 is concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.  </p></div>",

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a <em>base</em> of capital employed that's also declining.  This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking.  And from a first read, things don't look too good at <strong>Together Pharma</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/media/tase-tgtr/together-pharma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:TGTR</a>), so let's see why.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

The formula for this calculation on Together Pharma is: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.0052 = ₪375k ÷ (₪152m - ₪80m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Together Pharma has an ROCE of 0.5%.</strong> In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 13%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/media/tase-tgtr/together-pharma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Together Pharma </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/media/tase-tgtr/together-pharma-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/54033193-roce-1-dark-2/1761798331571\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:TGTR Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Historical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Together Pharma's ROCE against it's prior returns.

If current liabilities hadn't increased as much as they did, the ROCE could actually be even lower.   And with current liabilities at these levels, suppliers or short-term creditors are effectively funding a large part of the business, which can introduce some risks.     </p> <h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> In short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence.      Unsurprisingly then, the stock has dived 88% over the last  five years, so investors are recognizing these changes and don't like the company's prospects.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in.  But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can <em>make</em> more than 100%.  For example, the <strong>First International Bank of Israel Ltd</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/banks/tase-fibi/first-international-bank-of-israel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:FIBI</a>) share price has soared 192% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.   We note the stock price is up 1.7% in the last seven days.      </p><p> With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During five years of share price growth, First International Bank of Israel achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year.    This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 24% average annual increase in the share price.   This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  We note that for First International Bank of Israel the TSR over the last 5 years was 281%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> First International Bank of Israel shareholders are up 47% for the year (even including dividends).  But that was short of the market average.    On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 31% over half a decade  This suggests the company might be improving over time.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr18.76 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.   Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.    </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr151m for 7.95m shares.  On the other hand they divested 5.73k shares, for kr135k.     In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).</a> </p> <h2> Insider Ownership Of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria </h2><p> For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders.  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.   Insiders own 29% of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria shares, worth about kr596m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria Tell Us? </h2><p> It is good to see recent purchasing.    And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence.   However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious.     When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low.  Nice!

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin.  We can see that <strong>Formula Systems (1985) Ltd.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:FORTY</a>) does use debt in its business.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Why Does Debt Bring Risk? </h2><p> Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy.  Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2025 Formula Systems (1985) had debt of US$501.7m, up from US$472.7m in one year.    On the flip side, it has US$406.2m in cash leading to net debt of about US$95.5m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/386267-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798420891\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:FORTY Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Balance Sheet? </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Formula Systems (1985) had liabilities of US$1.19b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$540.9m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$406.2m in cash and US$883.2m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it has liabilities totalling US$444.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, Formula Systems (1985) has a  market capitalization of US$2.24b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Formula Systems (1985) </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). </p> <p> Formula Systems (1985)'s net debt is only 0.30 times its EBITDA.  And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 15.1 times over.  So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt.        Also good is that Formula Systems (1985) grew its EBIT at 12% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt.       The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Formula Systems (1985) will need earnings to service that debt.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Over the most recent three years, Formula Systems (1985) recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax.  This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> The good news is that Formula Systems (1985)'s demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler.   And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening.      Zooming out, Formula Systems (1985) seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us.  After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.    <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Formula Systems (1985) </a>, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.   </p> <p> If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our list of net cash growth stocks</a> without delay. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company.  As with many other companies <strong>NEPON Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:7985</a>) makes use of debt.

Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> How Much Debt Does NEPON Carry? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NEPON had debt of JP¥1.76b at the end of June 2025, a reduction from JP¥1.95b over a year.    However, it does have JP¥790.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about JP¥972.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883647-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798465515\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7985 Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At NEPON's Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NEPON had liabilities of JP¥2.46b due within 12 months and liabilities of JP¥995.0m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had JP¥790.0m in cash and JP¥1.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by JP¥1.11b.   </p><p> This is a mountain of leverage  relative to its  market capitalization of JP¥1.40b.  Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for NEPON </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While we wouldn't worry about NEPON's net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.7, we think its super-low interest cover of 1.8 times is a sign of high leverage.   It seems that the business incurs large depreciation and amortisation charges, so maybe its debt load is heavier than it would first appear, since EBITDA is arguably a generous measure of earnings.   So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately.       One redeeming factor for NEPON is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of JP¥44m, over the last twelve months.     When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is NEPON's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow.    Over the last year, NEPON recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect.  That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Neither NEPON's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt.   But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience.       Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think NEPON's debt poses some risks to the business.  So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
