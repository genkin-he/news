The latest earnings beat and return to profitability strengthen the case that scale and higher storage attachment can support margins, but the biggest near term swing factor is still access to affordable capital, while long term policy uncertainty around incentives remains a key overhang. This quarter’s results do not remove those risks, but they do improve Sunrun’s financial footing.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is Sunrun’s completion of the PG&amp;E Local PeakShift Power season, where over 1,000 customer systems delivered nearly 1,200 hours of highly accurate dispatch. Paired with storage attachment rates reaching 71% by year end 2025, this grid services performance gives more substance to the idea that batteries and virtual power plants could become a meaningful earnings driver, potentially offsetting some pressure from expiring tax credits and higher financing costs over time.</p> <p>Yet while the profit rebound is encouraging, investors should also be aware that concentrated policy risk around solar tax credits could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sunrun (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sunrun's narrative projects $2.9 billion revenue and $465.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun/puusfyum-run-supportive-policy-changes-and-market-demand-will-drive-mixed-outcomes-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Sunrun's forecasts yield a $22.74 fair value</a>, a 11% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa2a4c7-de78-47ca-906e-c5edae8a6116/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RUN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Before this surprise profit, the most bearish analysts assumed almost flat revenue growth near US$2.1 billion and no profitability, so their far more cautious view of Sunrun’s financing and policy risks may shift meaningfully as investors reassess those assumptions.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-run/sunrun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Sunrun</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 32% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The new 2026 revenue guidance of US$3.05–3.15 billion reinforces that diversification story but does not materially change the near term focus on execution in higher margin categories or the key risk around ongoing pricing and regulatory pressures.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement here is the nationwide opioids settlement, which commits Amneal to up to US$88.5 million in cash payments and up to US$177.4 million in naloxone product. That settlement helps clarify a major legal overhang just as management is asking investors to weigh its revenue outlook and pipeline against elevated leverage and the cost of maintaining compliance and quality across a broad portfolio.</p> <p>Yet behind this clearer revenue outlook and legal visibility, investors should still be aware of...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals/3tt90axt-amrx-recent-fda-approvals-and-pipeline-launches-will-drive-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Amneal Pharmaceuticals (it's free!)</a></p><p>Amneal Pharmaceuticals’ narrative projects $3.5 billion revenue and $207.9 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals/3tt90axt-amrx-recent-fda-approvals-and-pipeline-launches-will-drive-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Amneal Pharmaceuticals' forecasts yield a $15.20 fair value</a>, a 5% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-amrx/amneal-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AMRX 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/de8755ce-faf4-4170-8a24-89d67d81be0e/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>AMRX 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$11.94 to about US$70 per share, showing how far apart individual views on Amneal’s potential can be.

The model used here is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, which first applies analyst forecasts and then extends those cash flows further out using additional assumptions by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>The projections used in the model include Free Cash Flow of $154.6 million in 2026 and $219.0 million in 2028, with further years out to 2035 based on extrapolated estimates, all in $. When these projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $58.38 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of $25.14, this DCF estimate suggests a difference of around 56.9% between the modelled intrinsic value and the current market price.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED (based on this DCF model)</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests National Energy Services Reunited is undervalued by 56.9%.

This makes it a useful cross check alongside a DCF model. What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on what the market expects for future earnings growth and how risky those earnings are, with higher expected growth or lower perceived risk usually supporting a higher multiple.</p> <p>National Energy Services Reunited currently trades on a P/E of about 49.6x. That sits above both the Energy Services industry average of roughly 26.6x and the peer group average of about 32.7x. This suggests the market is applying a richer multiple than these broad comparison points.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the stock is 25.9x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it ties the multiple to these fundamentals, the Fair Ratio can offer a more tailored reference point than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>When set against the current P/E of 49.6x, the Fair Ratio of 25.9x points to the shares trading on a higher multiple than this framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you set out your story for National Energy Services Reunited, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see the Fair Value that falls out of those assumptions so you can compare it with the current share price.</p> <p>Instead of only relying on a single P/E or DCF number, a Narrative combines your view of the business with a live model. It updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive, and is available on the Community page where millions of investors share their own versions.</p> <p>For example, one National Energy Services Reunited Narrative might align with the bullish analyst fair value of US$30.00, built around confidence in hydraulic fracturing capacity and MENA contracts. Another could sit nearer the cautious US$10.00 view that focuses on regional concentration and energy transition risks. Seeing those side by side can help you decide whether the current US$25.14 price is above or below the story you find most convincing.</p> <p>For National Energy Services Reunited, here are previews of two leading National Energy Services Reunited narratives that may help frame the discussion:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/lj4o0x5w-rising-mena-demand-will-boost-oilfield-service-expansion-mfij?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 National Energy Services Reunited Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 16.1% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 19.65% a year</p> <ul> <li>Supports a higher fair value case built around hydraulic fracturing scale in Saudi Arabia, contract visibility across MENA and higher profit margins tied to technology and efficiency gains.</li> <li>Assumes National Energy Services Reunited can sustain robust revenue growth and margin expansion, with future earnings and P/E considered consistent with a US$30.00 anchor valuation.</li> <li>Notes meaningful risks from oilfield concentration, regional exposure and capital intensity, so the optimistic outcome still depends on execution and stable operating conditions.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited/1sh65zqm-revenue-recovery-and-sector-rebound-will-drive-long-term-shareholder-returns?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 National Energy Services Reunited Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this more cautious narrative: US$22.14 per share</p> <p>Current price vs this fair value: about 13.5% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.93% a year</p> <ul> <li>Frames the story around solid MENA contracts and Jafurah exposure, but anchors fair value closer to US$22.14, even with updated analyst targets around US$30.</li> <li>Builds in steady revenue growth and margin improvement, while assuming a more modest future P/E multiple compared with the bullish view.</li> <li>Highlights contract concentration, capital demands, working capital strain and long term energy transition as key risks that could keep the share price nearer this fair value.</li> </ul> <p>Viewed together, these narratives provide two different sets of assumptions for National Energy Services Reunited that can be compared with the current US$25.14 share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for National Energy Services Reunited? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/NESR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-nesr/national-energy-services-reunited\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7f4533ec-72e9-4bee-b095-b8fa053aca99/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:NESR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

It reflects both what the market thinks of those earnings today and how it is weighing the risks around them.</p> <p>Higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk usually support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tend to pull a “normal” or “fair” P/E lower. CACI International currently trades on a P/E of about 25.4x. That sits above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x, but below the peer group average of around 28.0x.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for CACI is 27.2x, which is its proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E might be given the company’s earnings characteristics, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This can be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for factors that can differ meaningfully between companies. With the current P/E of 25.4x sitting modestly below the Fair Ratio of 27.2x, the multiple suggests the stock may be undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-caci/caci-international/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1429557d-de3e-47fa-b954-56434f5f9dd9/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

For you as a shareholder, the timing matters because management is pairing the dividend move with a larger buyback authorization and a 10 year gas sales contract to a Midwest power plant, which together point to confidence in future cash generation and demand visibility. The contract ties a slice of production to a single large customer, which can smooth volumes compared with fully spot exposure.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Range Resources Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The long term power-plant contract supports the narrative that regional demand from power and data center loads can underpin Range Resources’ Marcellus-focused gas strategy.</li> <li>The step up in shareholder returns, including the dividend increase and expanded repurchase program, could test the narrative if capital needs for drilling and processing expansions turn out higher than expected.</li> <li>The specific 10 year offtake agreement to a Midwest power plant, and its contract terms, are not fully captured in the broader narrative around LNG exports and data center demand.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0cxwm1v1-rrc-medium-term-demand-from-lng-exports-and-datacenters-will-drive-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Range Resources</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A larger recurring cash dividend reduces flexibility if future drilling or processing costs rise faster than expected.</li> <li>⚠️ Concentration in Appalachia and reliance on power and LNG-linked demand leave Range Resources exposed if regional prices or regulatory conditions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A higher dividend combined with a US$1.5b buyback capacity signals that recent free cash flow levels have given the board confidence in returning capital.</li> <li>🎁 The 10 year gas supply agreement offers long term volume visibility that many peers such as EQT and Chesapeake Energy may not have to the same contract-specific extent.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how the new dividend compares with free cash flow over the next few quarters, especially as Range Resources spends US$650m to US$700m on its 2026 capital program. The key questions are whether the company keeps covering the dividend and buybacks from cash generated, how liquids stay above 30% of production as guided, and whether the Midwest contract meaningfully affects realized pricing. It is also worth tracking any changes in analyst views on the stock, given the recent cluster of Hold ratings and target tweaks, to see if this capital return move changes perceptions of risk and return.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Range Resources, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/RRC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Range Resources</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $343.7 million. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2030, with free cash flow projections moving from a loss of $146 million in 2026 and $13 million in 2027, to positive cash flows of $143 million in 2028, $231 million in 2029 and $313 million in 2030. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extrapolates further free cash flow estimates out to 2035 using its own growth assumptions.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $23.63 per share. Compared with the recent share price around $3.79, this implies the stock is about 84.0% undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iovance Biotherapeutics is undervalued by 84.0%.

Slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower one. That is why it helps to look at Iovance Biotherapeutics in the context of both its industry and its own fundamentals.</p> <p>Iovance Biotherapeutics currently trades on a P/S of 5.93x. This sits below the Biotechs industry average of 12.58x and also below the peer average of 6.82x provided. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for the company is 4.19x, which is an estimate of the P/S multiple that might be reasonable given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Compared with simple peer or industry comparisons, the Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored to the company’s profile.</p> <p>Putting that together, Iovance Biotherapeutics’ actual P/S of 5.93x is above the Fair Ratio of 4.19x, which points to the shares pricing in a richer multiple than this framework suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/af2848b1-cfd3-42ac-adb3-fafd0b7d60eb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:IOVA P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This allows you to compare that fair value with the current share price to help decide if the stock looks attractive or stretched on your assumptions.</p> <p>Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as company announcements, earnings or analyst revisions appear, you are not locked into a static view. You can quickly see how fresh data shifts the fair value output linked to your story.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, one investor might build a cautious Narrative anchored around a US$1.00 fair value while another might build an optimistic Narrative around US$20.00. By setting out the revenue, earnings and P/E assumptions behind each, you can decide which version feels closer to your own view or adjust the inputs to create something in between.</p> <p>For Iovance Biotherapeutics, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Iovance Biotherapeutics Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/13svd0s7-amtagvi-and-new-til-will-meet-aging-global-demand?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$17.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 78% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 56.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes Amtagvi adoption, broader patient access, and efficiency gains support higher revenue and a turnaround from losses to profit over the next few years.</li> <li>Builds in a higher profit margin and a future P/E of 75.10x, which is well above the current US Biotechs industry P/E referenced earlier in the article.</li> <li>Anchors on a Fair Value of US$17.00, based on bullish analyst assumptions for revenue of US$1.0b and earnings of US$126.3m by 2028, discounted back at about 7.11%.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iova/iovance-biotherapeutics/jv6qnzu7-rising-interest-rates-and-dilution-will-stifle-til-progress?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iovance Biotherapeutics Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$2.00 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value versus the recent US$3.79 share price: about 89% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 43.28% a year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes slower commercialization, high costs, complex distribution, and pressure from drug pricing scrutiny and interest rates, with continued execution risk.</li> <li>Uses a lower profit margin of 3.20% and a future P/E of 50.65x, while still baking in material revenue growth from Amtagvi and the pipeline.</li> <li>Arrives at a Fair Value of US$2.00 per share, reflecting a cautious view that the market may be pricing in more growth and profitability than these assumptions support.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame the recent US$3.79 share price between a bullish fair value of US$17.00 and a bearish fair value of US$2.00.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Sysmex shares are now priced attractively or still have further to fall, this article walks through what the current share price might be implying about the company's value.</li> <li>The stock last closed at ¥1,467, after a 9.6% move over the past 7 days, a modest 0.3% return over 30 days, and longer term returns of a 4.4% decline year to date, a 44.9% decline over 1 year, a 45.0% decline over 3 years, and a 58.1% decline over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Sysmex has focused on its position in the healthcare sector and how investors are reassessing companies in this space, especially those with established products and global reach. This backdrop helps frame why the share price has shifted recently and why some investors are rechecking their assumptions about what a fair price looks like today.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Sysmex currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>, meaning it screens as undervalued on half of the metrics we track.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is ¥27,423.60 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations point to projected free cash flow of ¥50,425.75 million by the year ending March 2030, with a series of annual projections between now and 2035 that Simply Wall St has discounted back to today.</p> <p>When all of those projected cash flows are added and discounted, the model arrives at an estimated fair value of ¥1,567.57 per share. Compared with the recent market price of ¥1,467, the DCF output implies Sysmex trades at about a 6.4% discount to this estimate, which places it in the “roughly in line” bucket rather than looking extremely cheap or expensive.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Sysmex is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

When investors expect stronger growth or see lower risk, they are usually willing to accept a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to justify a lower P/E.</p> <p>Sysmex currently trades on a P/E of 20.4x. That is close to the Medical Equipment industry average of 15.5x and very similar to the peer average of 20.5x, so on simple comparisons the stock looks roughly in line with similar names rather than clearly cheap or expensive.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might make sense for Sysmex given its earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk factors. This is more tailored than a straight peer or industry comparison because those benchmarks do not adjust for company specific strengths or weaknesses. For Sysmex, the Fair Ratio is 26.6x, which is higher than the current 20.4x P/E, suggesting the shares trade below this estimate of fair value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You will often see very different takes on Sysmex. For example, one Narrative might assume a much higher fair value than today’s price, while another assumes a much lower one, reflecting different expectations for its future.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Sysmex? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSE/6869\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/jp/healthcare/tse-6869/sysmex-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/4bfd7ddf-83f1-49f8-bedf-8070df38967e/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:6869 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
