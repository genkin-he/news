The new US$1.00 billion buyback may support near term earnings per share and capital returns, but it does not materially change the key risk that slowing digital audience growth or weaker real estate activity could weigh on future revenue and margins.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development alongside the buyback is News Corp’s continued dividend of US$0.10 per share for the half year to December 31, 2025. Taken together, the dividend and repurchase authorization highlight a heavier emphasis on returning cash to shareholders at a time when digital real estate, data services, and subscription businesses remain central to the company’s growth and earnings story.</p> <p>But while higher capital returns may look appealing, investors also need to be aware of how concentrated earnings have become in a smaller set of core segments, and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-nwsa/news/m1rw3d8h-digital-information-and-real-estate-will-shape-a-strong-future-s4oy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on News (it's free!)</a></p><p>News’ narrative projects $9.3 billion revenue and $754.0 million earnings by 2028.

It helps you compare the share price with the company’s profit today, without getting too deep into complex models.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative P/E range.</p> <p>NVIDIA currently trades on a P/E of 35.86x. That sits below the Semiconductor industry average of 43.84x and well below the peer average of 87.49x, which indicates the stock is priced more cautiously than many direct peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for NVIDIA is 54.79x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be appropriate given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because it weighs these company specific drivers, the Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 35.86x with the Fair Ratio of 54.79x suggests the shares trade below that fair range.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/08830e11-eecd-4a85-982d-b0ae1dfd6f7a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 19 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your NVIDIA Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are Simply Wall St stories that link your view of a company like NVIDIA to a set of numbers, a forecast and a Fair Value you can compare with the current share price.</p> <p>Each Narrative lets you spell out the story you believe in, then attach concrete assumptions such as future revenue growth, profit margins, discount rates and a future P/E, so the company’s story, the forecast and the valuation are all joined up in one place.</p> <p>On the Simply Wall St Community page, millions of investors publish these Narratives for NVIDIA, and you can see how different views translate into very different Fair Values, from about US$67.95 at the cautious end through to roughly US$346.28 at the optimistic end, with others like US$114.03, US$149.35, US$201.70, US$248.40 and US$271.52 sitting in between.</p> <p>Because Narratives continuously refresh when new data, earnings or news are added to the platform, you can quickly see whether your Fair Value still stacks up against NVIDIA’s live market price. This can help you decide if the stock now looks expensive, cheap or about in line with the story you believe.</p> <p>For NVIDIA, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, each Narrative links a clear story about the business to concrete numbers, so you can see how someone gets from their assumptions to a Fair Value per share. Here is how one bullish and one more cautious view stack up using that framework.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/391kfoxw-nvda-expanding-ai-demand-will-drive-major-data-center-investments-through-2026?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$253.02 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 30.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 30.90%</p> <ul> <li>The consensus style bull Narrative, titled \"NVDA: AI Infrastructure Supercycle Will Drive Multi-Year Data Center Leadership\", centers on NVIDIA as a core supplier for AI infrastructure, with demand coming from hyperscalers, sovereign AI projects and a widening range of industries.</li> <li>It leans on assumptions such as analyst forecasts for revenue to compound, higher profit margins over the next few years, a future P/E of 35.58x and a discount rate of around 10.49% to reach a Fair Value around US$253 per share.</li> <li>The author highlights both supportive factors such as platform leadership and full stack offerings, and risks such as export controls, custom accelerators from large customers, supply chain concentration and energy or regulatory constraints on large scale AI buildouts.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/81hhflx5-enterprise-hardware-segment-to-drive-sales-as-ai-takes-over?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$141.74 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 25.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 17.2%</p> <ul> <li>This Narrative, which applies a Fair Value around US$141.74, still sees NVIDIA well positioned in areas such as data centers, gaming GPUs, automotive platforms and Omniverse, but pairs that view with more conservative long term growth and margin assumptions.</li> <li>The author models a lower net margin of 40%, a future P/E of 60x and revenue growth of 17.2%, while also flagging factors that could restrain the outcome, including competition from AMD and Intel, pricing sensitivity for consumer GPUs, regulatory hurdles for deals and possible supply chain disruption.</li> <li>The update section adds NVLM 1.0 as a possible extra growth angle around open source multimodal models and a wider AI ecosystem, but treats it as upside optionality rather than something that changes the valuation inputs today.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two Narratives frame a realistic range of views that are both grounded in detailed assumptions rather than broad labels like \"cheap\" or \"expensive\".

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Carter's (CRI) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$925.5 million and basic EPS of US$1.76, alongside net income of US$64.2 million. This puts a clear spotlight on how effectively it is turning sales into profit. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$859.7 million and EPS of US$1.71 in Q4 2024 to US$925.5 million and EPS of US$1.76 in Q4 2025. Trailing twelve month revenue of US$2.9 billion and EPS of US$2.53 set the broader earnings backdrop. For investors, the latest results put the focus squarely on how sustainable these margins look as the business moves through the next phase of its cycle.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\"

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 3.2%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, Carter's net profit margin sits at 3.2%, compared with 6.3% a year earlier, and trailing twelve month net income is US$91.8 million on US$2.9b of revenue.</li> <li>Bears argue that margin pressure will stick because tariffs and cost inflation are lifting the effective duty rate into the high 30% range and Carter's is leaning on broad price increases to offset this, which they see as risky for a price sensitive young family customer base.\n    <ul> <li>This concern lines up with the drop in trailing margin from 6.3% to 3.2%, as higher duties and input costs can compress earnings even when revenue, at about US$2.9b, remains relatively stable over the last twelve months.</li> <li>Critics also point to the plan to close about 150 North American stores and reduce office based roles by roughly 15% as a sign the current store fleet and cost base are under pressure, and they question whether planned US$45 million of savings will be enough to offset those headwinds and support higher profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Carter's has seen EPS across 2025 quarters swing from US$0.01 in Q2 to US$1.76 in Q4, and bears are watching whether future cost savings truly reverse the visible squeeze in margins or simply keep earnings roughly in line with recent levels. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/x04win8h-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Carter's Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue Growth Slow, Earnings Forecasts Higher</h2> <ul> <li>Forecasts point to revenue growing around 1.1% per year while earnings are expected to grow about 9.7% per year, compared with five year earnings that have declined roughly 15% per year.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view think this gap between modest revenue growth and faster earnings growth can hold, because they see several levers working in Carter's favor, including digital channel expansion, store rationalization and product simplification.\n    <ul> <li>They highlight plans to reposition Carter's, OshKosh, Little Planet and Otter Avenue as primary brands on Amazon and other wholesale platforms, which they believe can lift higher value assortments and support Wholesale segment earnings even if total company revenue climbs only a little above the current US$2.9b level.</li> <li>Bulls also point to the planned US$45 million in annual productivity savings and the reduction of 20% to 30% of product choices, arguing that better inventory quality and a more efficient cost base can help translate low single digit revenue growth into the 9.7% earnings growth that is currently projected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to weigh this slow top line outlook against the earnings growth forecasts, it can help to see how bullish analysts connect Carter's cost actions and channel mix to their longer term story. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/k2mo6ka2-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Carter's Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 13.3x Versus DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>Carter's trades on a P/E of 13.3x compared with peers at 27.8x and the US Luxury industry at 21x, while a DCF fair value of US$13.94 sits well below the current share price of US$33.39.</li> <li>Consensus style analysis suggests this mix of low relative P/E and a DCF fair value below the market price gives investors two very different signals to weigh, especially when set alongside the long run earnings record.\n    <ul> <li>On one hand, the 13.3x P/E is lower than both peers and the broader US market at 19.6x, which is consistent with the idea that the stock appears inexpensive compared with similar companies even though trailing twelve month EPS is US$2.53 on net income of US$91.8 million.</li> <li>On the other hand, the DCF fair value of US$13.94 and the roughly 15% per year five year earnings decline highlight that, despite the lower P/E, longer term profit trends and cash flow estimates have been weaker, which is why some analysts are more cautious about how much upside is left from here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether THOR Industries is offering good value at its current share price, or if the recent weakness is a warning sign, this article walks through the key numbers so you can judge for yourself.</li> <li>The stock closed at US$96.13, with returns of a 15.4% decline over 7 days, a 14.1% decline over 30 days and an 8.8% decline year to date. The 1 year return sits at a 1.1% decline and the 3 year return at 11.1%.</li> <li>These moves sit against a backdrop where THOR Industries has remained a well-followed name in the recreational vehicle space, with investors watching how its end markets and order trends evolve. Even without a single recent headline driving the share price, the stock's pullback and mixed longer term returns are prompting fresh questions about what a fair price really looks like now.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, THOR Industries scores 4 out of 6 for potential undervaluation, giving it a current value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4</a>.

It is essentially asking what THOR Industries’ future cash generation is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For THOR Industries, the model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, starting from last twelve months free cash flow of about US$356.2 million. Analyst and extrapolated projections then step this forward, with free cash flow estimates such as US$272.1 million in 2026 and US$609.9 million in 2035, all in US$. Simply Wall St only takes direct analyst inputs for the earlier years, with later years extrapolated to build a full 10 year path.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows back to today results in an estimated intrinsic value of about US$108.19 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$96.13, the model implies the stock is 11.1% undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests THOR Industries is undervalued by 11.1%.

It rolls expectations about future growth and perceived risk into a single number, since higher growth or lower risk often line up with a higher “normal” P/E, while lower growth or higher risk tend to justify a lower one.</p> <p>THOR Industries is trading on a P/E of 18.01x. That sits close to the Auto industry average P/E of 18.98x, and below the peer group average of 21.45x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 18.65x for THOR Industries. This figure reflects factors such as the company’s earnings profile, profit margin, industry, market cap and risk characteristics, rather than just a simple comparison with peers.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can be more informative than looking at raw industry or peer multiples alone. With the current P/E of 18.01x versus a Fair Ratio of 18.65x, THOR Industries appears modestly undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:THO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2f032b8c-b6dd-4481-9a58-556393e7be3f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:THO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might assume stronger conditions and produce a fair value comfortably above it, showing how different perspectives can coexist on the same stock.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for THOR Industries? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/THO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-tho/thor-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:THO 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2f032b8c-b6dd-4481-9a58-556393e7be3f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:THO 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest Q4 2025 numbers and record US$978 million in full-year earnings, alongside a higher US$0.18 dividend and completed US$46.1 million buyback, reinforce the short term catalyst around capital returns and balance sheet strength, rather than fundamentally altering the story. The recent share price surge and a price target only modestly above the market suggest expectations are already elevated, which makes execution on 2026 production plans and projects like La Colorada Skarn more important.

The latest full‑year 2025 numbers fit that story: modest revenue growth, slightly higher EPS and another dividend affirmation suggest the short term catalysts still revolve around incremental earnings progress and ongoing capital returns rather than big growth surprises. With the share price up strongly over the past year and the stock already trading at a premium multiple, this earnings beat looks more like confirmation than a game changer. The bigger swing factors remain structural: the company’s negative equity position, reliance on strong franchisee economics and a dividend that is not well covered by free cash flow.</p> However, one of these structural issues could quickly matter more than the latest EPS uptick.\n\nWinmark's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 47% below fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-wina/winmark/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out if it's a bargain</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-wina/winmark\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"WINA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/33e0522f-da6e-4dde-a0e1-1c6d17f1b8cc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>WINA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> A single Simply Wall St Community fair value estimate sits at US$310.07, below recent trading levels.

The model applies an Average Return on Equity of 14.28% and a Cost of Equity of SEK12.56 per share. The gap between these two is the Excess Return, calculated at SEK16.19 per share, which is what this approach treats as value created over and above the required return.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value used in the model is SEK201.21 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. Combining these inputs produces an Excess Returns intrinsic value of roughly SEK569 per share. Compared with the recent share price of SEK347.8, this framework points to the stock trading at a 38.9% discount, which screens as undervalued on this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Swedbank is undervalued by 38.9%.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher “normal” P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull a fair P/E lower.</p> <p>Swedbank currently trades on a P/E of 11.92x. That sits slightly above the Banks industry average of 11.09x and also above the peer group average of 11.49x, so on simple comparisons the shares are not screening as cheap. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 12.02x for Swedbank. This is the P/E level suggested after factoring in elements like its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a straight peer or industry comparison because it is tailored to the company rather than relying on broad group averages.</p> <p>Set against the current P/E of 11.92x, the Fair Ratio of 12.02x is very close, which points to the shares being priced roughly in line with this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d68ba17d-9030-4dd5-bcd5-1c64af8b3dbf/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about Swedbank linked to concrete numbers like your own fair value, revenue, earnings and margin assumptions. All of these are updated in real time on Simply Wall St’s Community page as new news or results arrive. This way you can instantly see how your Fair Value compares to the current price and decide whether the share looks appealing, whether you prefer a cautious view closer to SEK 213.52 per share or a more optimistic stance around SEK 390 per share.</p> <p>For Swedbank, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Swedbank Narratives:</p> <p>First is a more optimistic take that leans toward a higher fair value and assumes that Swedbank can keep turning its retail and corporate banking footprint into steady business across Sweden and the Baltics.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/pvtd2lw8-long-term-digital-and-sustainability-trends-will-support-a-stronger-banking-franchise?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Swedbank Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 390.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this narrative: 10.8% below the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 5.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish view is based on Swedbank executing on its 15/27 plan, using stronger customer engagement and tighter cost control to support earnings through a lower cost to income ratio.</li> <li>It also relies on steady volume growth in core lending, including Swedish mortgages and Baltic lending, together with rising contributions from savings, pensions and asset management fees.</li> <li>This narrative assumes investors will be comfortable with Swedbank trading on a future P/E of 14.6x on 2029 earnings, with earnings projected at SEK 36.0b and a discount rate of 6.24% used to bring those numbers back to today.</li> </ul> <p>The second is a more cautious narrative that points to a lower fair value and focuses on what happens if interest income and revenue do not keep pace with current expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/d2z4fsdh-swedbank-kommer-oka-langsiktigt-tack-vare-hogkonjuktur?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Swedbank Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 213.52 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this narrative: 62.8% above the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 6.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>This bearish view starts from the idea that Swedish mortgage rates could settle nearer 3% from around 4.5%, which would feed through to lower interest income from mortgages and a smaller total revenue base.</li> <li>In this scenario, Swedbank’s total revenue moves from SEK 74.4b to SEK 63.0b, partly offset by about 10% growth in other services tied to the policy rate.</li> <li>From there, the narrative outlines a path where revenue recovers over three years to SEK 88.0b, but the starting point is a lower fair value of SEK 213.52 per share, which is based on a future P/E of 7.79 and a higher discount rate of 8.92%.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two narratives frame the current price between a more optimistic SEK 390.00 view and a more cautious SEK 213.52 view, allowing you to consider which set of assumptions comes closer to how you see Swedbank’s earnings power and risk profile.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The Music Valley Heavy Rare Earths acquisition, alongside the US$1.0 million Fermi Critical Minerals stake, reinforces that story by adding heavy rare earth and uranium exposure on top of Colosseum’s gold and rare earth potential. In the near term, though, the key catalysts still look familiar: drill results, approvals and any progress toward defining mineable resources. The 300,000 new shares are a routine capital move and, relative to Dateline’s history of sizeable equity raisings, unlikely to shift the dial on their own. What does change is the risk mix: more projects, in more commodities, with the same unprofitable, highly diluted base.</p> However, this broader opportunity set also brings a funding and dilution risk that investors should not overlook.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-dtr/dateline-resources-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on Dateline Resources</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-dtr/dateline-resources-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:DTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3dfef5e3-30f1-4058-825e-2b78010cbbdf/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:DTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> With six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community all clustering at A$0, you are seeing how widely opinions can differ when a company has minimal revenue and no profits.

Over the last few quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$10.96b in Q4 2024 to between US$8.5b and US$12.8b through 2025, while basic EPS ranged from US$3.20 to US$6.65 in that period. This gives investors a clear view of how earnings have tracked alongside the top line.

earnings slip to US$4.8b while revenue holds at US$46.7b</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Deere generated about US$46.7b in revenue and US$4.8b in net income, compared with US$51.5b revenue and US$7.1b net income in the prior 12 month snapshot, highlighting that profit has softened more than sales.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to precision agriculture tech and automation as future earnings drivers, yet the recent margin picture shows some friction:\n    <ul> <li>Net profit margin over the last year is 10.3%, down from 13%, even as analysts expect earnings to grow about 15.8% a year.</li> <li>That contrast supports the idea that higher margin software and automation could help over time, but it also shows that optimistic views are leaning on forecasts while recent profitability has moved the other way.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Consistent revenue but softer earnings often get optimistic and skeptical investors looking at different parts of the story, so it is worth seeing how Deere’s tech push and margin trends line up in the detailed narratives: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/DE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Deere.</strong></a></p> <h2>Premium 35.3x P/E meets DCF fair value of US$687.87</h2> <ul> <li>Deere trades on a trailing P/E of 35.3x versus peer and US Machinery industry averages of 27.5x and 28.4x, while its current share price of US$629.71 sits below the DCF fair value estimate of US$687.87 and the analyst price target of US$665.33.</li> <li>Some investors argue that paying up for Deere is justified by expected earnings growth, but the numbers cut both ways:\n    <ul> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 15.8% a year is slightly higher than the US market’s 15.6%, which supports the idea of a quality growth profile.</li> <li>At the same time, paying a premium P/E while net margins have moved from 13% to 10.3% means the optimistic stance leans heavily on those growth and margin expansion forecasts playing out.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are trying to figure out whether that premium multiple fits the optimistic case, it can help to see how bullish investors are framing Deere’s long term story and where they think earnings can go from here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"

Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Cash flow coverage of debt flagged as key risk</h2> <ul> <li>One of the clearest red flags in the recent analysis is that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow over the last 12 months, even though net income over that period was US$4.8b and margins were 10.3%.</li> <li>More cautious investors highlight that heavy reliance on financing and incentives could strain Deere if conditions stay tough, and this cash flow data gives that view some support:\n    <ul> <li>The major risk called out is specifically weak cash coverage of debt, not just lower earnings, which ties directly to how resilient the balance sheet is during slower patches.</li> <li>With revenue growth over the last year at 2.3%, below the broader US market’s 10.3%, skeptics focus on whether modest top line expansion plus softer margins leaves less flexibility to strengthen cash generation relative to debt.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For anyone weighing that more cautious angle,
