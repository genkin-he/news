That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 8.1% in total.  So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.   </p> <p> Turning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 11%  each year as estimated by the two analysts watching the company.  With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth  per year, that's a disappointing outcome. </p><p> With this information, we are not surprised that Otter Tail is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. </p><p> We've established that Otter Tail maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> Plus, you should also learn about these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-ottr/otter-tail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs we've spotted with Otter Tail</strong></a> (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant).  </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a low P/E. </a> </p></div>",

Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 46%, which means that First Community Bankshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.    </p><p> The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 10.9%.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.52 in 2015 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.24.      This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.1% a year over that time.     Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.    </p> <h2>First Community Bankshares Could Grow Its Dividend</h2> <p> The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time.     We are encouraged to see that First Community Bankshares has grown earnings per share at 6.5% per year over the past five years.       Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.    </p> <h2>In Summary</h2> <p> Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable.       While First Community Bankshares is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.  Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Perhaps the market is expecting the current trend of poor revenue growth to continue, which has kept the P/S suppressed.

Still, lamentably revenue has fallen 10% in aggregate from three years ago, which is disappointing.  So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing revenue over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the three analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 2.5% over the next year.  Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 37%, which is noticeably more attractive. </p><p> With this in consideration, its clear as to why Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S is falling short industry peers.  Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's P/S? </h2><p> While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> As expected, our analysis of Alpha and Omega Semiconductor's analyst forecasts confirms that the company's underwhelming revenue outlook is a major contributor to its low P/S.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in revenue isn't great enough to justify a higher P/S ratio.

Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$2.7b, statutory earnings were in line with expectations, at US$3.04 per share.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/294167-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1762001295097\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:OSK Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Oshkosh's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$11.0b in 2026. This reflects an okay 6.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 18% to US$12.38.        Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$11.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.50 in 2026.        The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Oshkosh </a></span></p> <p> The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$150, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations.        That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets.  There are some variant perceptions on Oshkosh, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$185 and the most bearish at US$119 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Oshkosh shareholders.    </p> <p> Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/industrials/machinery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates.     We would highlight that Oshkosh's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 9.8% p.a. growth over the last five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.4% annually.  Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Oshkosh is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates.        Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Oshkosh. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple Oshkosh analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-osk/oshkosh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Oshkosh </a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p></div>",

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 31% in total over the last three years.  Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 15% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> With this information, we can see why Neo-Concept International Group Holdings is trading at a P/E lower than the market.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From Neo-Concept International Group Holdings' P/E? </h2><p> Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Neo-Concept International Group Holdings maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.     </p><p> Don't forget that there may be other risks.

MGP Ingredients is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business.  In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.   </p><p> According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year.   If the dividend extends its recent trend, estimates say the dividend could reach 22%, which we would be comfortable to see continuing.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-mgpi/mgp-ingredients/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/288133-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1762001450868\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:MGPI Historic Dividend November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-mgpi/mgp-ingredients\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for MGP Ingredients </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past.      Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $0.05 total annually to $0.48.      This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25% a year over that time.     Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.    </p> <h2>Dividend Growth Potential Is Shaky</h2> <p> With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future.      MGP Ingredients' EPS has fallen by approximately 12% per year during the past five years.  This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future.   On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.    </p> <h2>MGP Ingredients' Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable</h2> <p> Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year.       The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great.      This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.  </p><p> Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.  Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>Limbach Holdings</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:LMB</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.  To calculate this metric for Limbach Holdings, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.21 = US$46m ÷ (US$343m - US$123m) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Thus, <strong>Limbach Holdings has an ROCE of 21%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Limbach Holdings </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/263324968-roce-1-dark-2/1762001534848\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:LMB Return on Capital Employed November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Limbach Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.  If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-lmb/limbach-holdings/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">free analyst report for Limbach Holdings </a>. </p><h2> What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us </h2><p> We like the trends that we're seeing from Limbach Holdings.    The numbers show that in the last  five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 21%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 109%.  This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.   </p> <p> One more thing to note, Limbach Holdings has decreased current liabilities to 36% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors.  This tells us that Limbach Holdings has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.   </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> To sum it up, Limbach Holdings has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last  five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Limbach Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Results overall were solid, with revenues arriving 2.3% better than analyst forecasts at US$134m. Higher revenues also resulted in substantially lower statutory losses which, at US$0.01 per share, were 2.3% smaller than the analysts expected.     Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company.

This would reflect a decent 16% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 70% to US$0.18.       Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$596.3m and US$0.22 per share in losses.         While the revenue estimates were largely unchanged, sentiment seems to have improved, with the analysts upgrading their numbers and making a favorable reduction in losses per share in particular.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-atrc/atricure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for AtriCure </a></span></p> <p> There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$51.44, suggesting that reduced loss estimates are not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation.        It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean.  There are some variant perceptions on AtriCure, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$64.00 and the most bearish at US$40.00 per share.   Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await AtriCure shareholders.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the AtriCure's past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/healthcare/medical-equipment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that AtriCure's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 18% over the past five years.    Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 8.4% per year.  So it's pretty clear that, while AtriCure's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on AtriCure.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  Importantly, <strong>Astrana Health, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ASTH</a>) does carry debt.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Astrana Health's Net Debt? </h2><p> As you can see below, Astrana Health had US$413.6m of debt at June 2025, down from US$442.0m a year prior.    On the flip side, it has US$342.1m in cash leading to net debt of about US$71.4m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/4634897-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762001677961\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqCM:ASTH Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Astrana Health's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, Astrana Health had liabilities of US$459.7m due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$444.7m due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of US$342.1m and US$369.4m worth of receivables due within a year.   So its liabilities total US$192.9m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  </p><p> Since publicly traded Astrana Health shares are worth a total of US$1.59b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Astrana Health </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While Astrana Health's low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.72 suggests only modest use of debt, the fact that EBIT only covered the interest expense by 3.5 times last year does give us pause.  But the interest payments are certainly sufficient to have us thinking about how affordable its debt is.        Shareholders should be aware that Astrana Health's EBIT was down 27% last year.   If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Astrana Health can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-asth/astrana-health/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, Astrana Health generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 84% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect.  That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Astrana Health's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better.   In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow.        We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like Astrana Health commonly do use debt without problems.     Considering this range of data points, we think Astrana Health is in a good position to manage its debt levels.  Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it.     There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down.   For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you'd have done very well indeed.   Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed. </p><p> Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether <strong>Corvus Pharmaceuticals</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:CRVS</a>) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn.   In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'.  We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Long Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Runway? </h2><p> You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash.   As at June 2025, Corvus Pharmaceuticals had cash of US$74m and no debt.   Importantly, its cash burn was US$29m over the trailing twelve months.   Therefore, from June 2025 it had 2.6 years of cash runway.    Importantly,  analysts think  that Corvus Pharmaceuticals will reach cashflow breakeven in 4 years.   That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly, it may well look to raise more cash.    The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/279359732-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762002107107\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGM:CRVS Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Corvus Pharmaceuticals </a></span></p> <h2> How Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Burn Changing Over Time? </h2><p> Because Corvus Pharmaceuticals isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business.  Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation.     With the cash burn rate up 36% in the last year, it seems that the company is ratcheting up investment in the business over time.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway.    Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our analyst forecasts for the company</a>. </p> <h2> How Easily Can Corvus Pharmaceuticals Raise Cash? </h2><p> While Corvus Pharmaceuticals does have a solid cash runway, its cash burn trajectory may have some shareholders thinking ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash.    Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business.  Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth.  By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate). </p><p> Since it has a market capitalisation of US$578m, Corvus Pharmaceuticals' US$29m in cash burn equates to about 5.0% of its market value.    That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.  </p><h2> How Risky Is Corvus Pharmaceuticals' Cash Burn Situation? </h2><p> It may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way Corvus Pharmaceuticals is burning through its cash.  For example, we think its cash runway suggests that the company is on a good path.   Although its increasing cash burn does give us reason for pause, the other metrics we discussed in this article form a positive picture overall.     One real positive is that  analysts are forecasting  that the company will reach breakeven.    After taking into account the various metrics mentioned in this report, we're pretty comfortable with how the company is spending its cash, as it seems on track to meet its needs over the medium term.     Taking a deeper dive, we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crvs/corvus-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> 3 warning signs for Corvus Pharmaceuticals</strong></a> you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.   </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of interesting companies,</a> and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/31433/healthy-growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this list of stocks growth stocks (according to analyst forecasts)</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if United Airlines Holdings stock is a bargain right now?

The aim is to reflect what those future dollars are worth in present terms. This approach helps investors determine if the current share price is justified by long-term fundamentals.</p> <p>United Airlines Holdings generated Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $2.61 billion over the last twelve months. According to analyst estimates and Simply Wall St's extrapolated projections, this figure is expected to steadily grow, potentially reaching approximately $7.39 billion in annual FCF by 2035. While analysts offer forecasts for the next five years, the remaining years in this ten-year outlook are estimated using internal models to account for evolving market dynamics.</p> <p>Based on these projections, the DCF model calculates a fair value of $189.20 per share. This is significantly above the recent share price, implying that United Airlines Holdings trades at a 50.3% discount according to this method. This sizeable gap suggests the stock may offer strong value for long-term investors.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests United Airlines Holdings is undervalued by 50.3%.

It offers a quick snapshot of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings. This makes it especially relevant when evaluating established businesses that have a consistent earnings track record.</p> <p>The PE ratio is not just a number. It is shaped by investor expectations for future growth and the level of risk associated with those earnings. Companies expected to grow quickly usually justify higher PE ratios, while more volatile or risk-prone companies often trade at lower multiples.</p> <p>Currently, United Airlines Holdings is trading at a PE ratio of 9.2x. This is almost identical to the average for the Airlines industry, which stands at 9.1x, and well below the broader peer average of 18.0x. While these comparisons are helpful, they do not fully account for company-specific factors such as United’s growth outlook, profit margins, or overall risk profile.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio comes in. The Fair Ratio for United Airlines Holdings is 13.9x. This figure is built from factors such as projected earnings growth, market cap, industry dynamics, profit margins, and risk. This tailored benchmark helps investors get a clearer, more personalized view of value, rather than relying solely on blunt industry averages or peer numbers.</p> <p>With United’s current PE ratio (9.2x) sitting noticeably below its Fair Ratio (13.9x), the stock looks undervalued on this measure. This suggests there may be upside for investors seeking value relative to the company’s unique profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-ual/united-airlines-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:UAL PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2fba0452-6017-43aa-8779-6dc48dbc2799/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:UAL PE Ratio as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1410 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your United Airlines Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is more than just numbers; it is your own story or perspective about a company, backed up with your assumptions about fair value, growth, and future profitability. Narratives connect what you believe about a company’s future to a specific financial forecast and then translate that into an actionable fair value.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's Community page, used by millions of investors, Narratives make it easy and accessible to create, share, and explore different outlooks for United Airlines Holdings. They help you decide whether to buy or sell by showing how your Fair Value compares to the current Price, giving you the confidence to act while also tracking how your thinking changes over time.</p> <p>Whenever new events or earnings updates occur, Narratives are updated dynamically, so your analysis always stays relevant. For example, while one investor may construct a Narrative reflecting a bullish fair value of $156, optimistic about United's margin expansion and brand strength, another may take a more cautious view, with a fair value of just $43, focusing on risks like industry pressures or cost challenges.</p> <p>This approach empowers you to invest based on your own view of United Airlines Holdings and understand exactly what would need to happen in both the business and the stock price for your Narrative to succeed.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for United Airlines Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-ual/united-airlines-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:UAL Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2fba0452-6017-43aa-8779-6dc48dbc2799/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:UAL Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This quarter’s earnings update showed higher revenue and net income, along with a substantial 24% jump in cloud annual recurring revenue, a clear signal of relevance in high-demand areas of cybersecurity. For the short term, this cloud growth is the biggest catalyst, potentially boosting both visibility and recurring revenues, particularly after Radware exceeded its Q3 revenue expectations. However, key risks remain. The stock still trades at a premium to both peers and the broader software sector, and a large one-off gain influenced past results, raising questions about the quality of earnings. Regional variability such as bright spots in the Americas but declines in EMEA is also a factor. Overall, the recent news helps strengthen the near-term growth story, but valuation and earnings consistency are issues investors can’t ignore.\nYet, reliance on one-off gains in profits is a concern investors should note.\n</p> Radware's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 20% below fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-rdwr/radware/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out if it's a bargain</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-rdwr/radware\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"RDWR Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e58cb083-3550-492b-9439-ce19f7278551/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>RDWR Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Six distinct fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community stretch from US$14.53 up to US$32.78 per share.

With a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 16% and multi-year gains surpassing 60%, the stock is making its mark among materials sector peers.</p> <p>If DIC’s steady run has you watching for next big movers, now is a smart time to broaden your outlook and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Yet with this recent upswing and notable long-term gains, the real question now is whether DIC remains undervalued or if the market has already priced in all future growth, which could leave little room for further upside.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 12.3x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>DIC’s shares recently changed hands at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.3x. This makes it appear more attractively valued than both its peers and the wider Japanese chemicals industry. For investors, this is a clear signal that the company is being priced at a discount compared to the competition and the sector’s own average.</p> <p>The P/E ratio measures how much the market is willing to pay for one unit of the company’s earnings. It is widely used to gauge whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its earnings power and is especially useful in mature sectors such as chemicals where earnings are a key driver of value. A lower P/E suggests the market is either overlooking potential upside or discounting the company’s growth prospects.</p> <p>Looking closer, DIC’s 12.3x multiple is not only below the JP Chemicals industry average of 13x, but it also trades at a substantial discount to the peer group, where the average P/E is 23x. Regression-based fair value models estimate DIC’s fair P/E at 14.8x. This indicates there may be room for re-rating if market perceptions improve and earnings trends hold steady.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4631/dic-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for DIC</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 12.3x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, unexpected shifts in industry demand or slower than anticipated earnings growth could quickly challenge this undervaluation story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4631/dic-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this DIC narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: What Does Our DCF Model Say?</h2> <p>Switching perspectives, the SWS DCF model offers a different angle.

This gap shines a light on optimism for structural shifts and company-specific catalysts that could change the outlook.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The closure of the de minimis loophole and the introduction of new tariffs are making fast fashion and new apparel imports more expensive. This increases the relative value proposition and attractiveness of secondhand platforms like ThredUp, which should support further customer acquisition and drive strong revenue growth.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> A week ago, <strong>NETGEAR, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:NTGR</a>) came out with a strong set of third-quarter numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock.      Revenues and losses per share were both better than expected, with revenues of US$185m leading estimates by 6.9%. Statutory losses were smaller than the analystsexpected, coming in at US$0.17 per share.      This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This would be a satisfactory 2.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.      Losses are expected to hold steady at around US$0.90.       Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$716.4m and US$1.28 per share in losses.         While the revenue estimates were largely unchanged, sentiment seems to have improved, with the analysts upgrading their numbers and making a very promising decrease in losses per share in particular.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for NETGEAR </a></span></p> <p> There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$36.33, suggesting that reduced loss estimates are not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation.        There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business.  Currently, the most bullish analyst values NETGEAR at US$40.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$29.00.   As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/tech/communications\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's also worth noting that the years of declining revenue look to have come to an end, with the forecast stauing flat to the end of 2026. Historically, NETGEAR's top line has shrunk approximately 16% annually over the past five years.    Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 9.9% annually.  Although NETGEAR's revenues are expected to improve, it seems that it is still expected to grow slower than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year.        On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for NETGEAR going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> You can also see our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-ntgr/netgear/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> analysis of NETGEAR's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.'  So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company.  We note that <strong>The Generation Essentials Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-tge/generation-essentials-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:TGE</a>) does have debt on its balance sheet.  But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/us-transformative-artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI is about to change healthcare.

Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is Generation Essentials Group's Debt? </h2><p> You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2025 Generation Essentials Group had US$230.2m of debt, an increase on US$91.7m, over one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of US$35.8m, its net debt is less, at about US$194.4m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-tge/generation-essentials-group/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/1928813961-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1762001820653\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:TGE Debt to Equity History November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Generation Essentials Group's Balance Sheet? </h2><p> We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Generation Essentials Group had liabilities of US$87.0m falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$319.5m due beyond that.   On the other hand, it had cash of US$35.8m and US$7.31m worth of receivables due within a year.   So its liabilities total US$363.4m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.  </p><p> This deficit casts a shadow over the US$71.3m company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals.   So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt.  At the end of the day, Generation Essentials Group would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-tge/generation-essentials-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Generation Essentials Group </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). </p> <p> Weak interest cover of 1.8 times and a disturbingly high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.6 hit our confidence in Generation Essentials Group like a one-two punch to the gut.  This means we'd consider it to have a heavy debt load.        Worse, Generation Essentials Group's EBIT was down 33% over the last year.   If earnings keep going like that over the long term, it has a snowball's chance in hell of paying off that debt.      When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Generation Essentials Group will need earnings to service that debt.  So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-tge/generation-essentials-group/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this graph of its long term earnings trend</a>. </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow.    Over the last three years, Generation Essentials Group reported free cash flow worth 3.9% of its EBIT, which is really quite low.  That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> On the face of it, Generation Essentials Group's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year.    And even its interest cover fails to inspire much confidence.      Considering everything we've mentioned above, it's fair to say that Generation Essentials Group is carrying heavy debt load.  If you play with fire you risk getting burnt, so we'd probably give this stock a wide berth.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-tge/generation-essentials-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 5 warning signs for Generation Essentials Group </strong> </a> (of which 2 can't be ignored!) you should know about.    </p> <p> At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this poor revenue performance will turn the corner.  You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.    </p> Keen to find out how analysts think Wave Life Sciences' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-wve/wave-life-sciences/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report is a great place to start</a>. <h2> Do Revenue Forecasts Match The High P/S Ratio?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the industry for P/S ratios like Wave Life Sciences' to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 15% decrease to the company's top line.   However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow revenue by an impressive 133% in total over the last three years.  Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would definitely welcome the medium-term rates of revenue growth.   </p> <p> Looking ahead now, revenue is anticipated to climb by 24% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company.  Meanwhile, the rest of the industry is forecast to expand by 29% each year, which is noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's alarming that Wave Life Sciences' P/S sits above the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen.  There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/S falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Shares in Wave Life Sciences have seen a strong upwards swing lately, which has really helped boost its P/S figure.      It's argued the price-to-sales ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. </p><p> We've concluded that Wave Life Sciences currently trades on a much higher than expected P/S since its forecast growth is lower than the wider industry.  When we see a weak revenue outlook, we suspect the share price faces a much greater risk of declining, bringing back down the P/S figures.  At these price levels, investors should remain cautious, particularly if things don't improve.     </p><p> Plus, you should also learn about these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-wve/wave-life-sciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs we've spotted with Wave Life Sciences</strong></a> (including 1 which is significant).  </p><p> Of course, <strong>profitable companies with a history of great earnings growth are generally safer bets</strong>.

Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again.     With many analysts covering the stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.  However, what if the stock is still a bargain?  Let’s take a look at Embecta’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Embecta is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average.  We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 9.33x is currently well-below the industry average of 27.66x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers.   However, given that Embecta’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-embc/embecta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Embecta </a></span></p> <h2> What does the future of Embecta look like? </h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-embc/embecta/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/714010553-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1762001963803\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NasdaqGS:EMBC Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.   Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.    Embecta's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.   </p> <h2>What This Means For You</h2> <p><strong>Are you a shareholder?</strong> Since EMBC is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to  accumulate more of your holdings  in the stock. With  an optimistic  outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as  financial health  to consider, which could explain the current price multiple. </p><p><strong>Are you a potential investor?</strong> If you’ve been keeping an eye on EMBC for a while, now might be the time  to enter the stock.  Its  prosperous  future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy EMBC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as  the track record of its management team,  in order to make a well-informed  assessment. </p> <p> If you want to dive deeper into Embecta, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a major selloff in <strong>Avantor, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-avtr/avantor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:AVTR</a>) shares in the week since it released its third-quarter report, with the stock down 23% to US$11.82.        Things were not great overall, with a surprise (statutory) loss of US$1.04 per share on revenues of US$1.6b, even though the analysts had been expecting a profit.      This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-avtr/avantor/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/403055588-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1762002070069\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:AVTR Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Following last week's earnings report, Avantor's 16 analysts are forecasting 2026 revenues to be US$6.58b, approximately in line with the last 12 months.      Earnings are expected to improve, with Avantor forecast to report a statutory profit of US$0.55 per share.       Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.77b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.64 in 2026.        The analysts seem less optimistic after the recent results, reducing their revenue forecasts and making a real cut to earnings per share numbers.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-avtr/avantor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Avantor </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target fell 6.1% to US$13.80, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates.         There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business.  Currently, the most bullish analyst values Avantor at US$19.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$12.00.   As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.    </p> <p> Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/healthcare/life-sciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates.     From these estimates it looks as though the analysts expect the years of declining revenue to come to an end, given the flat forecast out to 2026. That would be a definite improvement, given that the past five years have seen revenue shrink 0.5% annually.    Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 6.0% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, although revenues are improving, Avantor is still expected to grow slower than the industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results.        Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business.       The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Avantor's future valuation.  </p><p> With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Avantor. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.   We have estimates - from multiple Avantor analysts - going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-avtr/avantor/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-avtr/avantor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Avantor</strong></a> that you should be aware of.  </p></div>",
