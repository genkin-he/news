Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Another way to think of that is that for every AED1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn AED0.21 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It hasn't been the best quarter for <strong>Victory Securities (Holdings) Company Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HKG:8540</a>) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time.    But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years).  In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 321%. Impressive!  So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> During the last half decade, Victory Securities (Holdings) became profitable.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it’s gotten too pricey? Let’s dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco’s new store openings and bold expansion plans. These moves reinforce its reputation for consistent growth. The excitement around its international push and updated membership offerings has investors debating whether recent price moves reflect new opportunities or fresh risks.</li> <li>Costco currently lands a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. By several standard checks, this suggests it may be fully valued or even pricey right now. Let’s break down exactly how we arrive at that score in the next section and, even more importantly, look at what makes for a smarter way to judge value that goes beyond traditional methods.</li> </ul> <p>Costco Wholesale scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_low_value_score\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full valuation breakdown</a>.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Costco Wholesale Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates the true value of a company by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today. In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today’s dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco’s intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company’s current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company’s share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry’s average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco’s stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco’s PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco’s case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco’s current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco’s current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio. This means that, even after considering Costco’s growth, margins, and market-leading position, the stock appears to be overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1382 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers—such as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks—to your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company’s real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Afrimat's Profit Performance</h2><p> We'd posit that Afrimat's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item.      Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Afrimat is showing <strong>2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 1 of those is significant...   </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Afrimat's profit.   But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   If Neobo Fastigheter doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.   </p><p> <strong>Note:</strong> we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-neobo/neobo-fastigheter-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Neobo Fastigheter</a>. </p> <h2>Our Take On Neobo Fastigheter's Profit Performance</h2><p> Because unusual items detracted from Neobo Fastigheter's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter.      Because of this, we think Neobo Fastigheter's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The <strong>Icelandair Group hf.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ICE:ICEAIR</a>) share price has fared very poorly over the last month, falling by a substantial 27%.    The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 23% in that time.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Icelandair Group hf's P/S ratio of 0.2x, since the median price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio for the Airlines industry in Iceland is also close to 0.4x.  While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/S ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.    </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Icelandair Group hf </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ps-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/29621915-ps-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark-2/1761799171799\" width=\"1640\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ICSE:ICEAIR Price to Sales Ratio vs Industry October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3> What Does Icelandair Group hf's P/S Mean For Shareholders? </h3><p> Revenue has risen firmly for Icelandair Group hf recently, which is pleasing to see.   Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>FireFly Metals (ASX:FFM) just revealed further high-grade drilling results at its Green Bay Copper-Gold Project, confirming an 800 metre core where two mineralisation zones converge.

Its 1-month share price return sits at 31.8%, with a remarkable 98.9% rise year-to-date. Short-term momentum is clearly building, and the company’s 3-year total shareholder return of 172.9% shows how investor interest can gather pace when exploration milestones suggest deeper value may be unlocked.</p> <p>If you’re keen to expand your shortlist beyond resources, now’s a smart time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But with FireFly’s share price already surging following recent drilling results, does the stock still offer value at current levels?

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly’s elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project. Unless rapid progress and commercialisation materialise, such a premium can be hard to sustain.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, negative earnings and reliance on optimistic asset valuations mean that any operational setbacks could quickly pressure FireFly Metals’ premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FireFly Metals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Deep Discount on SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-book ratio suggests FireFly Metals is expensive compared to its industry, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.
