Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

The robust third quarter results reinforce management’s operational momentum, yet execution risk in new markets, especially the continued losses in China and the early stage of U.K. operations, remains the key short-term catalyst and the biggest risk. These recent results do not fundamentally shift the balance of these risks and catalysts.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the ramp-up of Hong Kong’s ePension business stands out as the most relevant development. This initiative is closely linked to iFAST’s recurring revenue ambitions and operational leverage, as onboarding moves toward completion. Efficient execution here could support ongoing profit and margin improvements, but the risk lies in managing rising expenses without delay.\n</p> <p> However, it’s important to remember that not all drivers of growth are within management control, particularly if...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/sg/diversified-financials/sgx-aiy/ifast-shares/jg59binl-digital-banking-and-ai-integration-will-expand-global-reach-kacr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on iFAST (it's free!)</a></p><p>iFAST's narrative projects SGD716.4 million revenue and SGD163.0 million earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Qnity Electronics (Q.WI) stock has caught the attention of investors recently. This has prompted closer examination of its current value and how recent trading trends might influence the company’s future trajectory.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-q.wi/qnity-electronics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Qnity Electronics.</a></p> <p>After a slow start to the year, Qnity Electronics has seen its share price slip 0.74% in the past day and fall 1.32% year-to-date. This recent price movement highlights a period of caution, and it may also set the stage for renewed interest should sentiment shift or fundamentals improve in the future.</p> <p>If you’re interested in what other names could be gaining traction, it’s a great time to broaden your radar and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Qnity Electronics losing ground so far this year, investors are left wondering whether the recent weakness signals an undervalued opportunity or if the market has already accounted for any future growth prospects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Book of 0%: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Qnity Electronics currently reports a negative price-to-book ratio of 0%, as the company is unprofitable. With shares closing last session at $94.04, this figure signals the market is assigning no premium to the business’s net assets in its current loss-making state.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio helps investors gauge whether a stock is valued above or below the value of its stated net assets. For Qnity Electronics, a 0% ratio shows that the company's liabilities completely offset its assets, reflecting a period of unprofitability and minimal tangible book value. In fast-evolving sectors like semiconductors, this can suggest the market is either discounting near-term risks or expecting a turnaround to take time.</p> <p>This dynamic raises the question: has the market already baked in all pessimism regarding future growth, or is there hidden value if profits rebound?</p> <p>Comparing to the broader semiconductor industry, Qnity Electronics’ price-to-book of 0% is exceptionally low. Most peers trade at a positive multiple, so this stands out as a warning signal for now. Without additional fair ratio benchmarks, it is difficult to project what level the market could move toward if fundamentals improve.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-q.wi/qnity-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 0% (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, limited transparency on growth drivers and continued losses could continue to weigh on sentiment.

After a solid run over the past three months, momentum has faded, with a 1-day move of -2.68% ending at €58.16. The one-year total shareholder return sits at just 2.6%. Overall, performance has turned sluggish, hinting that short-term risks may now be more top of mind than long-term growth potential.</p> <p>If you want to broaden your search and spot the next wave of opportunities, now is a great time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares trading meaningfully below analyst targets, some investors may wonder if the recent selloff has created an undervalued entry point.

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat. While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant. This EUR 60 million investment is central to Metsä Board’s strategy of boosting product quality and supporting its transition to fossil-free production, underscoring the company’s push for cost efficiency and alignment with long-term sustainability trends that underpin revenue recovery prospects.\n</p> <p> But with European demand still sluggish and restructuring ongoing, investors should be mindful that even well-executed upgrades cannot fully offset...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fi/materials/hel-metsb/metsa-board-oyj-shares/pd0x5y6d-cost-efficiency-and-fiber-packaging-will-drive-long-term-success-dfbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Metsä Board Oyj (it's free!)</a></p><p>Metsä Board Oyj’s narrative projects €2.1 billion revenue and €124.4 million earnings by 2028.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Despite big moves in the sector and recent expansion of its power management and imaging technology portfolio, ON Semiconductor’s 1-year total shareholder return has slumped to -30.2%. Its 5-year total return is still up nearly 99%.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

Over the last five years, the company has grown earnings at a 7.5% annual rate, and forward-looking estimates peg earnings expansion at 8.9% per year, which is slower than the broader US market's expected 15.6% annual pace. Revenue is projected to climb 4.3% annually, which also trails the national benchmark. Notably, the most recent year’s earnings growth of 0.6% came in below the company’s five-year average. While the ongoing record of profit growth stands out, investors face a premium-priced stock, as Sherwin-Williams trades at 33.1x earnings, well above both industry and peer averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-shw/sherwin-williams\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Sherwin-Williams.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers under the microscope, comparing Sherwin-Williams’ results to the most widely held narratives in the market.

It also follows a long run of robust long-term growth, so many investors are simply reassessing risks and expectations at these higher valuations.</p> <p>If you're curious how other parts of the market are performing right now, it's a smart moment to broaden your scope and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>The question now is whether O'Reilly Automotive's recent slide reveals an overlooked value, or if the market is simply factoring in all the growth that is yet to come.

O'Reilly's strategic emphasis on inventory and distribution capabilities, including a plan to increase average inventory per store by 5% in 2025, positions the company to maintain high availability and service levels. This approach will likely lead to sustained or increased revenue growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n8vnl9et-inventory-improvements-and-store-expansions-will-boost-retail-presence-welv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to see what powers this optimistic valuation?

While the recent foundry orders showcase solid customer traction and reinforce product differentiation, they do not materially alter the biggest short-term catalyst, broad-based order momentum in advanced packaging, nor do they meaningfully reduce Veeco’s largest risk of customer and geographic concentration.\n</p> <p> The October 2025 announcement of multiple new orders for WaferStorm, WaferEtch, and AP300 systems is the most relevant recent development, as these platforms underpin Veeco’s push into high-growth advanced packaging and next-generation device manufacturing. This aligns closely with the catalyst surrounding demand strength in high-performance computing and silicon photonics, marking continued validation of Veeco’s core technology in critical markets.\n</p> <p> But despite these positive signals, investors should keep in mind the continued risk if future orders remain concentrated in just a few customers or regions...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-veco/veeco-instruments/ntgzg4es-macroeconomic-uncertainty-will-compress-semiconductor-industry-margins-vi0n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Veeco Instruments (it's free!)</a></p><p>Veeco Instruments' outlook anticipates $782.0 million in revenue and $66.0 million in earnings by 2028.
