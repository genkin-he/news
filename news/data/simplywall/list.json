This suggests long term momentum while shorter term sentiment has cooled after earnings and guidance.</p> <p>If this mix of strong results and cautious sentiment has you looking around the sector, it could be a moment to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a source of other grid focused opportunities tied to electrification and building systems.</p> <p>With shares down over the past quarter yet trading at what looks like roughly a 20% intrinsic discount and close to 30% below analyst targets, is Acuity now mispriced, or is the market already accounting for all the future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 22.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Acuity last closing at $301.59 and the most followed narrative pointing to a fair value of $391.25, the gap between price and projected value is hard to ignore.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The recent acquisition of QSC, which improves Acuity's capabilities in built space management and cloud connectivity, is expected to contribute to future sales growth and margin expansion in the Acuity Intelligence Spaces segment.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/9obif0ug-ayi-margin-expansion-and-operational-efficiencies-will-support-balanced-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how one acquisition and a step up in electronics, pricing, and overseas reach feed into that fair value?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Viavi Solutions' share price still lines up with its fundamentals, this article will walk through what the current market price might be implying about value.</li> <li>At a last close of US$29.71, the stock has recent returns of 7.9% over 7 days, 41.3% over 30 days, 63.7% year to date, 165.7% over 1 year and 177.4% over 3 years, compared with 91.2% over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage has focused on Viavi Solutions' position within communications test and measurement and its role in supporting network build outs and technology rollouts. This helps frame how investors might think about the business backdrop to these returns. Commentary has also highlighted how investors are paying closer attention to companies exposed to connectivity and network infrastructure, which can influence how the market prices risk and potential.</li> <li>Despite these share price moves, Viavi Solutions holds a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>, so we will look at what different approaches like P/E, multiples and cash flow based estimates suggest about the current price. We then finish with a broader way of thinking about value that can round out those numbers.</li> </ul> <p>Viavi Solutions scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_low_value_score\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full valuation breakdown</a>.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Viavi Solutions Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model looks at the cash Viavi Solutions is expected to generate in the future and discounts those projections back to today using a required rate of return. The idea is to estimate what all those future cash flows are worth in today's dollars.</p> <p>For Viavi Solutions, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $74.64 million. Analyst and extrapolated projections, provided in the model, run out to 2035 and show free cash flow estimates reaching $536.31 million in that year, all expressed in US$ and then discounted back to the present.</p> <p>Pulling those discounted cash flows together, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$29.42 per share. Against a recent market price of US$29.71, the DCF suggests the stock is around 1.0% overvalued, which is a very small gap and well within any reasonable margin of error.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>Viavi Solutions is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher P/S multiple. In contrast, slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull that “normal” range down.</p> <p>Viavi Solutions currently trades on a P/S of 5.53x. That sits above both the Communications industry average P/S of 1.92x and the peer average of 2.91x, so the market is attaching a richer sales multiple than these broad benchmarks.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Viavi Solutions is 6.07x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/S might be given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks. Because it looks at these company level characteristics rather than just simple peer or industry comparisons, it can give a more tailored sense of what “fair” could look like.</p> <p>Putting that beside the current 5.53x P/S, Viavi Solutions is priced below the 6.07x Fair Ratio on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St's Community page you can use Narratives to write the story behind your numbers for Viavi Solutions. You can link your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast and fair value, then compare that fair value with the current price to help decide when to buy or sell. The Narrative automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. Different investors can, for example, plug in a more optimistic view closer to the US$26.07 fair value with higher assumed growth and margins, or a more cautious view closer to US$12.00 with tighter assumptions and a lower P/E, even though both are using the same company and data.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Viavi Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/VIAV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-viav/viavi-solutions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/60159ccf-24da-4367-a61f-bab4fb6b4742/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:VIAV 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new C$650 million senior notes broaden its funding options but do not obviously alter the near term balance between its key upside catalyst (capital deployment into attractive investments or buybacks) and its main risk around earnings sensitivity to interest rates and catastrophe losses; the impact looks incremental rather than transformational for now.</p> <p>In that context, Fairfax’s recent update that it repurchased 572,266 shares for about C$946.84 million under its latest buyback is particularly relevant. Together with the fresh long dated debt, this pairing of issuance and repurchases highlights how the company is actively managing its capital structure around the current catalysts and risk profile, even if the exact mix between debt reduction, new investments, and future buybacks is still to be determined.</p> <p>But investors should also be aware that if interest rates reverse, the same balance sheet that benefits Fairfax today could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares/bvw1rr5q-share-repurchases-and-preferred-redemptions-will-drive-outperformance-amid-currency-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Fairfax Financial Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>Fairfax Financial Holdings' narrative projects $41.8 billion revenue and $2.9 billion earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares/bvw1rr5q-share-repurchases-and-preferred-redemptions-will-drive-outperformance-amid-currency-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Fairfax Financial Holdings' forecasts yield a CA$2708 fair value</a>, a 15% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:FFH 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/edb5d400-0098-4b2e-af68-888f673ce731/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:FFH 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were already assuming about US$41.9 billion of revenue and US$3.8 billion of earnings by 2028, so this fresh C$650 million in long term funding could either reinforce that upbeat story or challenge it, depending on how you feel about interest rate risk and capital deployment.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Fairfax Financial Holdings</a> - why the stock might be worth over 2x more than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your Fairfax Financial Holdings research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/insurance/tsx-ffh/fairfax-financial-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free Fairfax Financial Holdings research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate Fairfax Financial Holdings' overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Seeking Other Investments?</h2><p>These stocks are moving-our analysis flagged them today.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>CubeSmart (CUBE) has just wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$282.7 million and basic EPS of US$0.34, while trailing twelve month revenue sits at US$1.1 billion and EPS at US$1.46, giving investors a clear read on the top and bottom line heading into the new year. Over recent periods, the company has seen revenue move from US$268.5 million and EPS of US$0.45 in Q4 2024 to US$282.7 million and EPS of US$0.34 in Q4 2025, alongside trailing twelve month EPS shifting from US$1.73 in Q4 2024 to US$1.46 in Q4 2025. With that mix of higher revenue, modest EPS growth over the longer run and margin compression, this result set puts the focus firmly on how durable CubeSmart’s earnings power really is.</p> <a

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Squeezed As Net Income Softens</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, net income moved from US$391.2 million at a 36.6% margin a year ago to US$333.8 million at a 29.7% margin, so more revenue is now translating into a smaller share of profit.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about stable occupancy and cost control supporting stronger earnings over time, yet\n    <ul> <li>the step down in net income from US$391.2 million to US$333.8 million sits alongside that 6.9 percentage point margin compression, which shows costs have taken a larger bite out of revenue over the last year,</li> <li>so anyone leaning on the bullish angle of gradually improving margins needs to square that with the recent data that points to pressure on profitability instead.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Up, EPS Growth Lagging Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month revenue is US$1.1b, growing 4.8% per year compared with the broader US market at 10.3% per year, while EPS growth is 0.8% per year, also well below the US market at 15.6% per year.</li> <li>Bulls highlight resilient demand in dense urban markets and a steady storage need across housing cycles, and that story lines up only partly with the numbers\n    <ul> <li>because the 4.8% revenue growth rate points to a business that is expanding, but not at the pace of the wider market at 10.3% per year,</li> <li>and EPS growth running at 0.8% per year, against 15.6% for the US market, suggests that even with occupancy support, earnings power has not kept up with broader equity benchmarks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On this set of figures, bulls argue CubeSmart’s slower growth still rests on sticky demand, but you can see how the recent margin squeeze complicates that story before you read the full case in <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 CubeSmart Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation, Yield And Balance Sheet Tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$41.14, CubeSmart is trading on a P/E of 28.1x, below a peer average of 37x and slightly below the industry at 29.7x, with a 5.15% dividend yield and a DCF fair value of about US$59.08 indicating a sizeable gap to that modelled value.</li> <li>Skeptics point to balance sheet strain and slower growth, and the data gives them some clear talking points\n    <ul> <li>since one of the key risks flagged is that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow over the last 12 months, which sits awkwardly beside a valuation case built on a DCF fair value of US$59.08 that is well above the current price,</li> <li>and when you pair modest revenue growth of 4.8% per year and 0.8% EPS growth with that 5.15% yield, it underlines that investors are being compensated with income while also taking on a balance sheet that is working harder to support the capital structure.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears often focus on that debt coverage risk alongside slower growth, so if you want to see how far that concern goes, the full case is laid out in <a

Keep an eye on how SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales moves, since inflation in healthcare and other store expenses has already been a pressure point. It is also worth tracking how the DIY segment behaves if tariffs or inflation stay elevated, and how O'Reilly's execution compares with peers like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts on inventory availability, delivery times, and digital ordering.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for O'Reilly Automotive, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ORLY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for O'Reilly Automotive</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Pritzker after more than two decades in the role.</li> <li>The move comes alongside public mention of Pritzker's past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</li> <li>Hyatt has appointed current CEO Mark S. Hoplamazian as the new Chairman, concentrating leadership in a single figure.</li> <li>The transition highlights both succession planning and governance considerations for the company.</li> </ul> <p>For you as an investor, the key point is that Hyatt Hotels operates as a global hospitality company, with its results closely tied to travel demand, corporate bookings, and leisure trends. Leadership shifts at a company like this can matter because capital allocation, brand priorities, and risk oversight typically flow through the boardroom.</p> <p>The decision to move Mark S. Hoplamazian into the Chairman role suggests Hyatt is aiming for continuity while addressing reputational and governance questions head on. As you assess NYSE:H, this kind of transition is worth watching for any changes in board composition, disclosure practices, or long term direction that could affect how the company is run.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-h/hyatt-hotels/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hyatt Hotels</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

For you as an investor, that concentrates decision making in one person, which can speed up responses on issues like capital allocation, portfolio reshaping, and expansion into markets such as India, where Hyatt has talked about a larger long term footprint. At the same time, combining the roles can raise governance questions about independent challenge in the boardroom, especially when reputational risk has just been put in the spotlight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Hyatt Hotels Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The leadership handover to Hoplamazian could support execution of Hyatt’s asset light approach and development pipeline, because the same leader is setting strategy and overseeing the board that signs off on transactions and new projects.</li> <li>Concentrating the Chairman and CEO roles may challenge the governance pillar of the narrative, as some investors prefer separate roles when a company is pursuing large-scale expansion and complex acquisitions.</li> <li>Pritzker’s explicit reference to reputational issues linked to his past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and his focus on stewardship, may not be fully captured in prior narratives that center more on hotel growth and operating performance than on brand and governance risk.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/jbrfz0ry-h-expanding-luxury-openings-and-buybacks-will-drive-hospitality-leadership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Hyatt Hotels</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ The combination of Chairman and CEO roles can reduce independent oversight, which matters when the company is balancing growth projects, debt obligations, and brand risk in a competitive set that includes Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, and IHG.</li> <li>⚠️ The public mention of Pritzker’s past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell introduces a reputational angle that could affect stakeholder perception and potentially influence how partners, guests, or regulators view the company.</li> <li>🎁 Leadership continuity, with a long serving CEO stepping into the Chair role, can help maintain consistency in Hyatt’s asset light approach and its push into markets such as India without a disruptive change at the top.</li> <li>🎁 The board’s emphasis on stewardship and succession planning may support long term stability, which can be important when management is managing a global pipeline and competing with other large operators for owners and franchisees.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how Hyatt’s board structure evolves, including any moves to reinforce independent oversight around Hoplamazian. Watch for disclosures on reputational and governance topics in future filings or shareholder communications, and whether the company adjusts its risk oversight frameworks. On the business side, track how consistently leadership executes on the asset light model and development goals while managing financial risks that analysts have already flagged. Comparing Hyatt’s progress against large peers over the next few years can help you judge whether this leadership setup is helping or hindering execution.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Hyatt Hotels, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/H\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Hyatt Hotels</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $41.1 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations feed into a ten year path where projected free cash flow reaches $177.2 million in 2030, with intermediate years such as 2026 to 2029 ranging from $60.6 million to $145.7 million before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back and added up, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $29.19 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $25.01, this implies the stock is roughly 14.3% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Warby Parker is undervalued by 14.3%.

Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often go with a lower one.</p> <p>Warby Parker currently trades at a P/S of 3.51x. That sits above the Specialty Retail industry average P/S of 0.46x and below the peer group average of 5.32x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Warby Parker is 1.74x, which is its view of what the P/S could be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the sector because it tries to line up the multiple with the company’s own profile rather than broad group averages. With the current 3.51x P/S versus a Fair Ratio of 1.74x, the shares screen as trading above that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out a clear story for Warby Parker, link that story to your own revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, and end up with a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on Simply Wall St's Community page, used by millions of investors.</p> <p>A Narrative connects what you think is happening in the business to a financial forecast and then to a Fair Value. It updates automatically when new information like earnings or news, such as the appointment of a new CFO or progress on AI glasses, is added to the platform.</p> <p>For example, one investor might build a more optimistic Warby Parker Narrative with a Fair Value of US$32.00, while another might lean on a more cautious Narrative with a Fair Value of US$18.00. Comparing either of those to the latest market price can help you judge whether the stock looks expensive, cheap, or close to your own view of fair.</p> <p>For Warby Parker however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Warby Parker Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties a clear story to specific assumptions on revenue, margins and valuation. Use them as starting points, not answers, and decide which feels closer to how you see the business.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/ebv0lo7c-google-partnership-and-retail-expansion-will-unlock-new-market-opportunities-hp9u?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Warby Parker Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$27.25</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at US$25.01: around 8%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.78% per year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes expansion of retail stores, shop in shops and eye care services supports higher active customers, higher average revenue per customer and better margins over time.</li> <li>Bakes in an AI and wearable tech angle, including the Google partnership and digital tools, as a way to open up new, higher margin revenue streams and improve efficiency.</li> <li>Accepts execution and competition risks, but treats current pricing as broadly in line with analyst expectations for revenue of about US$1.2b and higher earnings over the next few years.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/y2hgxha2-update-for-warby-parker?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Warby Parker Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$18.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at US$25.01: around 39%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 13.63% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on the risk that AI glasses, heavy store growth and higher fixed costs do not translate into enough incremental profit, which could leave margins under pressure.</li> <li>Flags competition, insurance mix and reduced owned programs like home try on as potential headwinds for average revenue per customer and repeat engagement.</li> <li>Takes the low end of analyst price targets as a guide, viewing the current share price as baking in expectations that may be too optimistic relative to these risks.</li> </ul> <p>Both narratives use analyst style assumptions, but they reach very different conclusions on what counts as a reasonable price for the same cash flows. The real value for you is in deciding which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Warby Parker's growth, profitability and risk, then adjusting the numbers until the story and the valuation line up.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Warby Parker? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/WRBY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest earnings beat and 2026 revenue guidance support that thesis but do not materially change the key near term catalyst, which is continued provider growth and integration of recent acquisitions. The biggest risk remains that rising healthcare labor costs and staffing shortages could offset operating leverage and keep profitability constrained.</p> <p>The most relevant update here is management’s 2026 GAAP revenue outlook of US$2.35 billion to US$2.45 billion, issued alongside the strong 2025 results. That guidance aligns with Privia’s push to grow its provider base, integrate the acquired Evolent ACO business, and deepen its value‑based contracts, all of which tie directly into the short term catalyst of sustaining volume and earnings growth as its network expands.</p> <p>Yet investors should also be aware of how higher physician and staff costs could pressure margins if...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nasdaq-prva/privia-health-group/c5qcoms5-aging-us-demographics-and-ai-adoption-will-transform-healthcare-services-e65t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Privia Health Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>Privia Health Group's narrative projects $2.7 billion revenue and $75.9 million earnings by 2028.

This suggests investor enthusiasm is building around Tyra’s clinical progress.</p> <p>If this biotech story has caught your eye, it could be a good moment to look at other healthcare names too. You could start with our screener of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">27 healthcare AI stocks</a>.</p> <p>With Tyra trading at US$33.31 and sitting below an average analyst price target of about US$49.29, the key question is whether recent optimism leaves more upside on the table or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Preferred Price-to-Book of 6.3x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a P/B basis, Tyra Biosciences looks expensive, with a 6.3x multiple versus a peer average around 5.1x and a wider US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x.</p> <p>The P/B ratio compares the company’s market value to its net assets on the balance sheet. For early stage biotech names with no revenue and ongoing losses, investors often lean on this multiple because traditional earnings based measures like P/E are not usable.</p> <p>With Tyra currently unprofitable, reporting a loss of $111.684m and a negative Return on Equity of 39.81%, a premium P/B suggests the market is paying more for each dollar of net assets than for many peers. Given that Tyra is also considered expensive relative to companies of similar size, this higher multiple can be seen as the market placing a higher value on its pipeline and FGFR focused platform. This is despite earnings still being negative and not forecast to turn profitable over the next 3 years.</p> <p>Compared with both its direct peer set P/B of 5.1x and the broader US Biotechs P/B of 2.7x, Tyra’s 6.3x stands out as materially higher. That is a strong relative premium that relies heavily on investor confidence in future execution rather than current financials.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-tyra/tyra-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 6.3x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, the story could change quickly if clinical trial data disappoints or if funding conditions tighten, especially given the ongoing losses and lack of current revenue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-tyra/tyra-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Tyra Biosciences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If this feels like a bullish setup, it is worth checking the underlying data yourself and deciding how comfortable you are with the current risk profile.

RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back program reflects how retailers and brands are trying to keep customers engaged, and measurable performance marketing tools remain a key focus across the sector.</p> <p>The exit from Games Publishing removes a more content heavy, project driven activity from the NasdaqGS:ZD portfolio and aligns the company more tightly with its existing core operations. Together, these developments may influence how the business allocates capital across segments and how steady or variable its future revenue mix may look.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nasdaq-zd/ziff-davis/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ziff Davis</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>For Ziff Davis, RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back rollout looks like an attempt to steady the Tech &amp; Shopping segment after an 18% Q4 revenue decline linked to weaker search traffic and affiliate commissions. A guaranteed 1% cash back across more than 4,000 merchants, some funded directly by RetailMeNot, gives retailers a clearer, performance based offer and could help shift the business mix from pure traffic driven affiliate revenues toward more direct, relationship based marketing spend. That may matter if search referrals remain pressured or if competitors such as Groupon and Honey keep pushing aggressive offers to retailers and brands.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Ziff Davis Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on RetailMeNot and exiting Games Publishing aligns with the narrative that Ziff Davis is concentrating on higher margin, recurring digital services and performance marketing, in line with its emphasis on SaaS like and subscription based revenue streams.</li> <li>The weak Q4, flat to slightly negative near term revenue commentary, and Tech &amp; Shopping headwinds challenge the idea that all core verticals can easily support ongoing revenue and margin expansion without further pressure.</li> <li>The Guaranteed Cash Back program and the decision to fully exit Games Publishing, while retaining rights to potential future performance payments, add more detail on how management is reacting to traffic shifts and AI driven content changes, which is not fully captured in the earlier high level growth narrative.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/sxkxg2vh-cloud-based-solutions-and-digital-advertising-will-drive-future-markets-bs1w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Ziff Davis</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Q4 2025 net income fell sharply to US$0.37 million from US$64.09 million a year earlier, which shows how quickly profitability can compress when key segments weaken and one off items hit results.</li> <li>⚠️ The 18% revenue decline in Tech &amp; Shopping and management’s decision to defer 2026 guidance highlight uncertainty around search traffic trends, AI content licensing outcomes, and how quickly the company can adjust its model.</li> <li>🎁 Full year 2025 revenue of US$1.45b versus US$1.40b a year earlier, strong free cash flow, and US$174 million in buybacks, including 30.48% of shares repurchased since 2020, show that Ziff Davis is using cash generation to reshape its capital structure.</li> <li>🎁 Growth in Health &amp; Wellness, Connectivity, and Cybersecurity &amp; Martech, helped by AI powered data tools and increased pharma ad spend, suggests the company has businesses that are less dependent on search engine referrals than Tech &amp; Shopping.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>As a shareholder or potential investor, you may want to watch how quickly RetailMeNot’s Guaranteed Cash Back program translates into steadier Tech &amp; Shopping revenue, especially if search referral volumes stay under pressure. The company’s ongoing talks around AI content licensing with large platforms could influence both traffic and monetization, so any updates there will matter. It is also worth tracking whether management continues to exit or shrink lower return activities, similar to Games Publishing, and how that affects margins and earnings over the next few quarters. Finally, with share repurchases already reducing the share count by more than 10% in 2025, future capital allocation decisions, including any extension of the buyback program, will likely remain a key part of the story.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Ziff Davis, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ZD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Ziff Davis</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

An extended license would keep its fields in play for longer, and this is occurring at a time when European governments are focused on energy security and stable domestic supply. The news directly connects BlueNord's operational footprint with long dated policy support from Denmark.</p> <p>If the license extension proceeds, it could lengthen BlueNord's production horizon and support the long term planning of capital spending and field development.

The company has just reported its highest quarterly production on record, outlined full year guidance around 25,000 barrels per day, and highlighted the Tyra hub’s maximum potential at about 30,000 barrels per day once stable operations are in place. At the same time, BlueNord has extended its US$1.4b reserve based lending facility to 2031 and added an Accordion option of up to US$400m. This gives the company additional financial flexibility for future commercial opportunities tied to these assets. For you, the key link is that a longer license life, more visible production from Tyra, and longer dated debt maturity all point to BlueNord framing the DUC as a core, cash generative hub that can support dividends, such as the proposed NOK 42.84 per share for Q4 2025, and ongoing investment. This is particularly relevant when you compare BlueNord with other North Sea focused players such as Aker BP, Harbour Energy or Var Energi, where field lives, license terms and financing arrangements also shape the long term profile.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The BlueNord Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The potential license extension supports the narrative’s focus on Tyra and the DUC as long term production anchors that can underpin revenue and support BlueNord’s aim of returning a high share of operating cash flow to shareholders.</li> <li>Analysts in the narrative highlight high debt and financial obligations as a constraint, and while the extended lending facility provides flexibility, a longer license life could encourage further investment that keeps leverage and interest costs in focus.</li> <li>The narrative puts most of the emphasis on Tyra’s redevelopment and gas price assumptions, whereas the invitation to extend the DUC license to 2050 introduces a regulatory and policy dimension that may not be fully captured in those earlier expectations.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f5b80muw-tyra-redevelopment-and-north-sea-gas-will-secure-long-term-stability-1v14\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for BlueNord</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that earnings are expected to decline by an average of 2.5% per year over the next 3 years, which could limit how much value BlueNord can extract from a longer DUC license period.</li> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are described as not well covered by earnings, so more capital spending on extended field life or new projects could stretch the balance sheet if cash flows do not track expectations.</li> <li>🎁 The company is assessed as trading at a very large discount to an estimate of its fair value, which means investors are currently paying a low price relative to that model if the long term DUC opportunity is realised.</li> <li>🎁 BlueNord has recently become profitable and is proposing a sizeable dividend for Q4 2025, so a longer production horizon from the DUC may support its stated intention to return a high share of operating cash flow to shareholders.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you will want to watch how negotiations with the Danish authorities progress, particularly any conditions around emissions, investment commitments or decommissioning that come with a license extension to 2050. Track whether Tyra can move from ramp up to stable production near the 30,000 barrels per day potential described by management, and how that compares to the 25,000 barrels per day guidance that already includes planned shutdowns. It is also worth monitoring how BlueNord uses its extended US$1.4b lending facility and US$400m Accordion option, and whether dividend plans such as the NOK 42.84 per share proposal remain aligned with production, cash flow and debt metrics. For context, comparing BlueNord’s capital returns, leverage and license life with peers like Aker BP, Harbour Energy and Var Energi can help you assess how differentiated this DUC opportunity really is.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for BlueNord, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/OB/BNOR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for BlueNord</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

It is a way of asking what you might reasonably pay now for those projected future dollars.</p> <p>For XPEL, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The company’s last twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $58.9 million. Analyst inputs and Simply Wall St extrapolations suggest Free Cash Flow of $57.9 million in 2026, rising in steps to a projected $242.4 million in 2035, all in $. These amounts are discounted back to today using a required return, which results in an estimated intrinsic value per share of about $126.69.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price around $42.62, the DCF output implies XPEL is trading at a 66.4% discount to this intrinsic value, which indicates a materially undervalued stock on this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests XPEL is undervalued by 66.4%.

A higher or lower P/E usually reflects what the market expects for future earnings growth and how much risk investors feel they are taking on.</p> <p>XPEL currently trades on a P/E of about 23x. That sits below the peer group average of roughly 24.9x and slightly above the Auto Components industry average of about 20.7x. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a “Fair Ratio” of 20.6x for XPEL, which is the P/E level it might trade on given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, size, industry and key risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio approach can be more informative than comparing only with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the specific characteristics of the company rather than assuming all businesses in the same group deserve the same multiple. With XPEL at 23x versus a Fair Ratio of 20.6x, the shares screen as somewhat expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-xpel/xpel/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:XPEL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/358cfe36-d2c1-426c-b8a4-35a170d548cd/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:XPEL P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce Narratives, which are simple stories you create about XPEL that tie your view of its business, revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and a fair value. You can compare that fair value to today’s price to help you decide whether you see the stock as attractive or not. You can then keep that view alive on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share Narratives that update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. In XPEL’s case you might, for example, align with a more optimistic community Narrative that sees fair value closer to US$55, or instead with a more cautious Narrative closer to US$38. By choosing which story feels more realistic to you, you turn scattered data into a clear, numbers backed view you can act on.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for XPEL? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/XPEL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-xpel/xpel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:XPEL 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/358cfe36-d2c1-426c-b8a4-35a170d548cd/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:XPEL 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $16.9 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2030, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further. Within that, projected free cash flow in 2030 is $479.7 million, with interim figures for 2026 to 2035 ranging from $1.5 million to $704.3 million, all in dollar terms.</p> <p>Discounting these projected cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $189.83 per share.

Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can often support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower, more cautious range.</p> <p>Immunocore currently trades on a P/S of 4.09x. That sits below the Biotechs industry average P/S of 12.43x and also below the peer average of 15.83x that Simply Wall St uses for similar companies. Simply Wall St also calculates a Fair Ratio of 7.80x, which is its view of an appropriate P/S once factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margin, market cap and company specific risks are taken into account.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is often more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for Immunocore’s own profile rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the current P/S of 4.09x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 7.80x, the preferred multiple suggests the shares are trading at a discount to that model.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-imcr/immunocore-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:IMCR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/edea9913-d917-4ad7-b10e-3a17b28ddda2/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:IMCR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St that comes through Narratives, where you set out your own story about Immunocore Holdings, connect it to explicit assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, and let the platform translate that into a financial forecast, a fair value, and a simple Fair Value vs Price view that updates as new news or earnings arrive. All of this is within the Community page used by millions of investors, so you can quickly see, for example, how one investor’s optimistic view of a fair value around US$100 based on faster growth and a higher P/E contrasts with another investor’s cautious fair value near US$24.92 that leans on slower growth and a lower multiple. You can then decide which story, if either, lines up with how you see the company today.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Immunocore Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/IMCR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-imcr/immunocore-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:IMCR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/edea9913-d917-4ad7-b10e-3a17b28ddda2/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:IMCR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
