Analyst estimates supply free cash flow projections through 2030, with 2030 projected at $850.3 million. Further annual figures out to 2035 are extrapolated by Simply Wall St rather than based on new analyst forecasts.</p> <p>When those projected cash flows are discounted back to today and aggregated, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $68.18 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $132.45, this implies the stock is 94.3% overvalued on this DCF view.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Entegris may be overvalued by 94.3%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENTG Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a2517e2d-a065-413c-b6d6-da75a000c443/chart/dcf?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENTG Discounted Cash Flow as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Entegris.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Entegris Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Entegris, the P/E ratio is a common way to think about value because it links what you pay for each share to the earnings the business is currently generating. In general, higher expected growth and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/E, while slower growth and higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative P/E being reasonable.</p> <p>Entegris is currently trading on a P/E of 85.40x. That sits above the semiconductor industry average of about 43.84x and above the peer group average of 51.05x, so the stock is priced at a higher multiple of earnings than many competitors. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio metric suggests a P/E of 41.49x might be more in line with Entegris’ characteristics.</p> <p>The Fair Ratio is Simply Wall St’s proprietary estimate of what a company’s P/E “should” be, taking into account factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk. Because it adjusts for these elements in one place, it can be more tailored than a straightforward comparison with peers or the sector average. On this basis, Entegris’ current P/E of 85.40x is above the Fair Ratio of 41.49x, which points to the shares screening as expensive on this earnings based approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ENTG P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a2517e2d-a065-413c-b6d6-da75a000c443/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ENTG P/E Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives on Simply Wall St let you attach your own story about Entegris to the numbers by linking your assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value to a clear forecast. You can then compare this with the current share price. Each Narrative lives on the Community page and updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. Narratives can accommodate very different views, for example one investor who sees Entegris as worth US$156.00 and another who sees fair value closer to US$75.00. This way, you can quickly see which storyline you agree with and how that lines up against today’s market price.</p> <p>For Entegris however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Entegris Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris/alu0nz2c-ai-and-5g-expansion-will-transform-semiconductor-manufacturing-worldwide?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Entegris Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish Narrative: US$156.00 per share</p> <p>Gap between fair value and last close: about 15.1% below this Narrative fair value, based on the Simply Wall St method for comparing US$132.45 to US$156.00</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this Narrative: 9.69% a year</p> <ul> <li>Leans on Entegris’ role in advanced semiconductor materials, with AI, advanced computing, 5G and IoT all feeding into higher wafer complexity and more Entegris content per chip.</li> <li>Assumes that global fab build outs and supply chain reshoring support multi year demand for Entegris’ high value consumables, while new products in areas like molybdenum deposition and advanced wet chemistries help lift margins.</li> <li>Accepts real risks around tariffs, cyclicality and the debt load, but still views a higher future P/E as reasonable if revenue, margins and earnings track the more optimistic analyst forecasts tied to a US$156 fair value.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris/a0id32tm-tariffs-and-regulatory-burdens-will-undercut-semiconductor-industry-prospects?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Entegris Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish Narrative: US$75.00 per share</p> <p>Percentage difference to last close: the last close price of US$132.45 sits about 76.6% above this Narrative fair value, using the Simply Wall St comparison between US$132.45 and US$75.00</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption in this Narrative: 6.13% a year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on tariff risk, regulatory pressure, higher compliance costs and competition, especially where Chinese retaliatory measures and regional price pressure could weigh on revenue and margins.</li> <li>Flags the cyclical nature of semiconductor capital spending and the risk that slower fab construction and potential commoditization in some product lines leave earnings more volatile than the current P/E suggests.</li> <li>Works off a lower P/E assumption and a US$75.00 fair value, arguing that if these risks play out, investors may be less willing to pay a premium multiple for Entegris even if earnings continue to grow.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how these stories are built out in full and compare the assumptions line by line, the Entegris Community page is where both Narratives sit side by side.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Entegris? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ENTG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-entg/entegris\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ENTG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a2517e2d-a065-413c-b6d6-da75a000c443/chart/quote-price?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ENTG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Yet the current trailing loss and the US$23.8 million loss in Q4 2025 show that the company is still in the loss making phase that those forecasts are trying to look past.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts in that balanced view are assuming earnings reach US$155.6 million by around 2028, compared with trailing 12 month losses of US$119.1 million, which is a big swing that has not shown up in the reported figures yet.</li> <li>Investors who lean on that consensus story may want to pay close attention to whether the recent revenue ramp from US$42.2 million in Q4 2024 to US$172.6 million in Q4 2025 actually starts to pull EPS out of the current US$0.42 loss on a trailing basis.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly losses narrow as revenue scales</h2> <ul> <li>Looking quarter by quarter in FY 2025, revenue moved from US$63.5 million in Q1 to US$172.6 million in Q4, while quarterly net losses went from US$32.9 million in Q1 to US$23.8 million in Q4 and basic EPS went from a US$0.13 loss in Q1 to a US$0.08 loss in Q4, so the loss per share is smaller even though the company is still not profitable.</li> <li>The bullish narrative leans heavily on Terronera and Kolpa lifting output and margins, and this pattern of higher quarterly revenue alongside a smaller loss per share in Q4 2025 is the kind of trend bulls point to when they argue that ramping production can eventually bridge the gap between US$119.1 million of trailing losses and the much higher earnings they are forecasting.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls are assuming revenue growth of 45.4% a year and margins moving from a 28.0% loss to a 42.0% margin, which is far ahead of the current trailing profile where losses have grown at a compounded rate over the last five years.</li> <li>That optimism contrasts with the fact that even at US$172.6 million of Q4 revenue, net income was still a loss of US$23.8 million, so anyone leaning toward the bullish view may want to see more quarters where higher production volumes translate into clear margin improvement.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Have the optimistic assumptions on Terronera, Kolpa and future margins really met the test of these numbers yet, or are bulls still mainly leaning on forecasts rather than results? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/odgcukto-update-for-endeavour-silver\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Endeavour Silver Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>DCF fair value far above CA$18.98 price</h2> <ul> <li>The provided signals show Endeavour Silver trading at CA$18.98 with a P/S of 8.8x, compared with an indicated DCF fair value of about CA$59.61 and peer and industry P/S levels of 14.4x and 9.8x respectively, so the shares are priced below that DCF figure and below the peer average multiple even while the business is loss making.</li> <li>Bears focus on the fact that Endeavour has been unprofitable over the last 12 months with losses having risen at a very large compounded rate over five years, and they question whether projects like Terronera, Kolpa and Pitarrilla can offset issues such as elevated all in sustaining costs, higher unit costs at Kolpa and balance sheet pressure from negative working capital and project debt.\n    <ul> <li>In the cautious narrative, earnings are only expected to reach US$169.1 million by around 2029 with margins at 23.6%, which is still a big step up from today’s trailing loss of US$119.1 million and basic EPS loss of US$0.42, so there is a gap between current performance and the earnings level implied even in the bearish case.</li> <li> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/buhzytf4-if-silver-reaches-dollar100-per-oz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Endeavour Silver on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Given the mix of optimism and caution running through these numbers, this is a good moment to move quickly and stress test the story for yourself.

The company also reports annual revenue growth of about 18% and net income growth that is very large relative to the prior year, while earnings remain in loss territory.\n</p> <p> For context, JinkoSolar designs and produces a wide range of photovoltaic products, including solar modules, wafers, cells, recovered silicon materials, and ingots, and also provides solar system integration, EPC services, energy storage systems, and solar power projects. As of December 31, 2024, it reports integrated annual capacity of 120 gigawatts for mono wafers, 95 gigawatts for solar cells, and 130 gigawatts for solar modules, serving customers in China, the United States, Mexico, Australia, Japan, multiple Middle Eastern markets, Europe, and other regions.\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-jks/jinkosolar-holding\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for JinkoSolar Holding.</a></p> <p> Recent trading has been soft, with a 1 day share price decline of about 4.4% and a year to date share price decline near 9.5%.

The fibrinogen concentrate launch in Europe, with a U.S. launch planned pending FDA approval, adds a potential additional revenue stream on top of the existing immunoglobulin franchise that the summary says helped drive the 7% revenue increase.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Grifols Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The successful fibrinogen launch and progress across plasma therapies fit with the idea that an expanding therapy portfolio and pipeline can support growth and margin improvement.</li> <li>At the same time, the narrative highlights high debt and pricing pressure as ongoing concerns. Even with higher net income, investors may still weigh how much room Grifols has to keep funding expansion and deleveraging.</li> <li>The specific contribution of the new fibrinogen product to mix and profitability is not clearly detailed in the narrative. As a result, this product launch may add a layer of potential that is not fully captured there.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/wizl45v0-expanding-global-plasma-network-will-unlock-new-potential-rifp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Grifols</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Analysts highlight that Grifols carries high leverage, which can limit flexibility if conditions become less favorable or if funding needs rise.</li> <li>⚠️ Pricing pressure and currency swings are identified as ongoing headwinds that could affect how much of the current earnings level is sustainable.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings grew strongly year on year, with net income moving from €157 million to €402 million, which supports the view that operations are currently trending in the same positive direction.</li> <li>🎁 The company has been growing profit or revenue and is described as having forecast earnings growth as well as a valuation that some models see as below estimated fair value.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how quickly the new fibrinogen concentrate gains traction in Europe and whether the FDA process in the U.S. stays on track. The pace and quality of free cash flow generation will also matter, because that feeds directly into any deleveraging plans and future investment capacity.

When you combine that with cautious full year guidance that fell short of analyst expectations, it helps explain why management may be prioritizing scale, service reach, and digital convenience to support future comparable sales and operating margins.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The O'Reilly Automotive Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The faster expansion and omnichannel plans line up with the narrative focus on inventory depth and distribution reach, which is framed as a way to keep service levels high and support same store sales resilience.</li> <li>Rising cost pressure in SG&amp;A, plus weaker DIY demand due to tariffs and inflation, pushes against the narrative assumption that margins can remain steady while the company continues to expand.</li> <li>The specific acceleration to 225 to 235 new stores in 2026 and the emphasis on professional strength are not fully captured in the earlier narrative, which focuses more on store growth generally and trade related sourcing shifts.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/n8vnl9et-orly-improving-supply-chain-will-drive-resilient-same-store-sales-strength\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for O'Reilly Automotive</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Higher SG&amp;A from inflation in healthcare, casualty claims, and store level costs could pressure O'Reilly's 19.5% operating margin if not offset by stronger sales or efficiency gains.</li> <li>⚠️ A weakening DIY segment, influenced by tariffs and inflation, may be a drag on growth if pro demand slows or if competitors like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts compete harder on price or service.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings grew by 6.3% over the past year and are forecast to grow 6.13% per year, which supports the idea that the dual market model and distribution network are still driving profit growth.</li> <li>🎁 The plan to add 225 to 235 stores in 2026 and the strong professional business create more touchpoints with customers, which can support same store sales and help spread fixed costs across a larger base.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch whether the 2026 store cohort and omnichannel investments translate into healthy comparable store sales across both DIY and professional customers, not just headline revenue growth. Keep an eye on how SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales moves, since inflation in healthcare and other store expenses has already been a pressure point. It is also worth tracking how the DIY segment behaves if tariffs or inflation stay elevated, and how O'Reilly's execution compares with peers like AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts on inventory availability, delivery times, and digital ordering.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for O'Reilly Automotive, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ORLY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for O'Reilly Automotive</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Leadership shifts at a company like this can matter because capital allocation, brand priorities, and risk oversight typically flow through the boardroom.</p> <p>The decision to move Mark S. Hoplamazian into the Chairman role suggests Hyatt is aiming for continuity while addressing reputational and governance questions head on.

Watch for disclosures on reputational and governance topics in future filings or shareholder communications, and whether the company adjusts its risk oversight frameworks. On the business side, track how consistently leadership executes on the asset light model and development goals while managing financial risks that analysts have already flagged.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Warby Parker at around US$25.01 is priced for its brand story or for its actual fundamentals? This article breaks down what the current share price may be implying about value.</li> <li>The stock has had a mixed run, with a 5.5% return over the past week, a 2.0% decline over the last 30 days, a 10.6% return year to date and a 1.1% return over the past year, while the 3 year return sits at 100.4%.</li> <li>Recent headlines around Warby Parker have focused on its position in the US eyewear retail market and its progress as an established direct to consumer brand. This helps frame how investors are thinking about growth opportunities and business risks. These themes are often front of mind for the market when a consumer name like this sees shifts in sentiment and share price.</li> <li>On our checklist based valuation model, Warby Parker currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 out of 6</a> on undervaluation checks.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $41.1 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations feed into a ten year path where projected free cash flow reaches $177.2 million in 2030, with intermediate years such as 2026 to 2029 ranging from $60.6 million to $145.7 million before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back and added up, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $29.19 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $25.01, this implies the stock is roughly 14.3% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Warby Parker is undervalued by 14.3%.

Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often go with a lower one.</p> <p>Warby Parker currently trades at a P/S of 3.51x. That sits above the Specialty Retail industry average P/S of 0.46x and below the peer group average of 5.32x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Warby Parker is 1.74x, which is its view of what the P/S could be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the sector because it tries to line up the multiple with the company’s own profile rather than broad group averages. With the current 3.51x P/S versus a Fair Ratio of 1.74x, the shares screen as trading above that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out a clear story for Warby Parker, link that story to your own revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, and end up with a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on Simply Wall St's Community page, used by millions of investors.</p> <p>A Narrative connects what you think is happening in the business to a financial forecast and then to a Fair Value. It updates automatically when new information like earnings or news, such as the appointment of a new CFO or progress on AI glasses, is added to the platform.</p> <p>For example, one investor might build a more optimistic Warby Parker Narrative with a Fair Value of US$32.00, while another might lean on a more cautious Narrative with a Fair Value of US$18.00. Comparing either of those to the latest market price can help you judge whether the stock looks expensive, cheap, or close to your own view of fair.</p> <p>For Warby Parker however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Warby Parker Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties a clear story to specific assumptions on revenue, margins and valuation. Use them as starting points, not answers, and decide which feels closer to how you see the business.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/ebv0lo7c-google-partnership-and-retail-expansion-will-unlock-new-market-opportunities-hp9u?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Warby Parker Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$27.25</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at US$25.01: around 8%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.78% per year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes expansion of retail stores, shop in shops and eye care services supports higher active customers, higher average revenue per customer and better margins over time.</li> <li>Bakes in an AI and wearable tech angle, including the Google partnership and digital tools, as a way to open up new, higher margin revenue streams and improve efficiency.</li> <li>Accepts execution and competition risks, but treats current pricing as broadly in line with analyst expectations for revenue of about US$1.2b and higher earnings over the next few years.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/y2hgxha2-update-for-warby-parker?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Warby Parker Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$18.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at US$25.01: around 39%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 13.63% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on the risk that AI glasses, heavy store growth and higher fixed costs do not translate into enough incremental profit, which could leave margins under pressure.</li> <li>Flags competition, insurance mix and reduced owned programs like home try on as potential headwinds for average revenue per customer and repeat engagement.</li> <li>Takes the low end of analyst price targets as a guide, viewing the current share price as baking in expectations that may be too optimistic relative to these risks.</li> </ul> <p>Both narratives use analyst style assumptions, but they reach very different conclusions on what counts as a reasonable price for the same cash flows. The real value for you is in deciding which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Warby Parker's growth, profitability and risk, then adjusting the numbers until the story and the valuation line up.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Warby Parker? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/WRBY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
