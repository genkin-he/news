            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Axactor (OB:ACR) reported that losses have accelerated over the last five years, growing at an average annual rate of 19.7%. However, revenue is forecast to expand by 16.7% per year, a pace that stands out against the broader Norwegian market's 2.8% annual growth. The company's Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x remains below key industry benchmarks. Investors will notice that despite sales momentum, persistent negative profitability and shares trading above the estimated fair value (NOK7.1 vs NOK4.24) frame a complex earnings picture.</p> <a

percentage points due to successful refinancing, and ongoing IT-driven cost reductions (‚Ç¨800,000 saved per quarter) are aiming to boost Axactor's free cash flow and net profitability.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, disciplined cost management and the rollout of digital collection platforms are set to drive margin gains, with net margins forecast to climb from -49.6% to 21.9% over the next three years.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative notes that new third-party collection contracts, especially in Norway, could accelerate revenue and margin growth in 2026‚Äì2027 if cost savings materialize as planned.</li> <li>What is surprising is that despite flat revenue growth in certain regions and recent margin pressure from onboarding costs, consensus expects efficiency initiatives and a larger addressable market to materially lift profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See where analysts agree and disagree on whether Axactor‚Äôs efficiency push is enough to drive sustainable profit improvements. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\"

Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Market Share Upside Tied to NPL Investments</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor is strategically investing in new non-performing loan (NPL) portfolios, aiming to capture a bigger share of Europe‚Äôs growing consumer debt market and capitalize on a strong NPL disposal pipeline.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that management‚Äôs pivot toward acquiring new NPLs, combined with proprietary analytics and IT upgrades, positions Axactor for improved collection performance and higher future revenues.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus view emphasizes the large-scale third-party collection contracts and recently extended debt maturities into 2027‚Äì2028 as supporting longer-term growth ambitions.</li> <li>Bears argue that if flat year-over-year gross revenues (down 9% overall, down 1% excluding the Spain sale) persist due to a more ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù market, hoped-for NPL-related gains could fall short.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Faces Profitability Hurdles</h2> <ul> <li>Axactor‚Äôs Price-To-Sales Ratio of 1.3x is lower than both its peer average (3x) and the broader Consumer Finance industry (1.7x), but the current share price (NOK7.1) still trades above DCF fair value (NOK4.24) and below the analyst target (NOK10.00), revealing a tension between quantitative cheapness and earnings uncertainty.</li> <li>Consensus narrative calls out that to justify the analyst target price, Axactor needs to grow annual revenue to ‚Ç¨317.5 million and convert losses of ‚Ç¨-67.6 million to ‚Ç¨69.5 million in profit within four years, a significant turnaround embedded into current forecasts.\n    <ul> <li>This expectation leans on higher margins, steady share count, and a future PE ratio of 5.1x, meaning risk remains if margin expansion or revenue targets are missed against industry headwinds and competition.</li> <li>Investors are encouraged to cross-check these optimistic forecasts against their own outlook, as the stock currently trades in the limbo between promising multiples and persistent losses.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and

Its current share price of 2772.00 is well below its DCF fair value estimate of 5237.79.</li> <li>Building on the prevailing market view, this discount highlights an under-the-radar opportunity for investors who focus on value rather than chasing momentum.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls argue that defensive infrastructure names like Yokogawa Bridge often attract a premium, so its current valuation could appeal to buyers seeking safety and capital preservation.</li> <li>On the other hand, some caution that the lack of a strong price premium may reflect low near-term excitement, leaving prospective investors to balance stability against potential for fast gains.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Sustainability Remains a Key Watchpoint</h2> <ul> <li>The primary risk flagged is around the sustainability of Yokogawa Bridge‚Äôs dividend, which moderates enthusiasm given the company‚Äôs otherwise steady performance trends.</li> <li>In line with the prevailing market view, this risk echoes a broader pattern seen in the infrastructure sector where headline profits are solid but payout ratios or future distributions require close monitoring.\n    <ul> <li>Loyal income-focused investors are attracted by the company‚Äôs stable record, yet persistent questions on dividend security could limit share price upside if not addressed.</li> <li>Ongoing improvements in profit margins may help mitigate this risk, but a clear dividend commitment will remain central for shareholder confidence going forward.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The company saw a 19.8% share price return over the last 90 days and a one-year total shareholder return of nearly 30%.

With a last close price of ¬•4,567, the market is valuing its earnings at a significant discount to both the broader market and its sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay today for a yen of current earnings. For established auto parts companies like Nifco, the P/E offers a clear lens into market expectations for future profit growth or risk.</p> <p>Nifco‚Äôs low P/E suggests investors may be underappreciating its recent profit surge. While the stock sits well below the peer average of 16.4x and the Japanese auto components industry average of 11.6x, its trailing earnings growth has been impressive. However, forecasts point to less optimistic profit trends in coming years. This could be tempering the multiple assigned by the market.</p> <p>It is helpful to compare this 9.4x P/E not only to competitors, but also to what analysts deem a ‚Äúfair‚Äù multiple for Nifco. The estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio is 8.4x, indicating the stock looks a bit expensive on this metric. The market‚Äôs enthusiasm may be pushing it closer to, or slightly above, its justified level based on recent performance and expected outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nifco</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 9.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower net income growth and a smaller discount to analyst price targets could weigh on sentiment if profitability does not meet expectations.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7988/nifco-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nifco narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Says \"Undervalued\"</h2> <p>Looking at Nifco through the lens of our DCF model tells a different story.

To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period.  This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. </p><p> Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive.  While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow.  To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive (India) has an accrual ratio of -0.16 for the year to September 2025.   That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit.    In fact, it had free cash flow of ‚Çπ14b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of ‚Çπ13.3b.    Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.  </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Profit Performance</h2><p> Happily for shareholders, Colgate-Palmolive (India) produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers.      Because of this, we think Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem!     And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Stove Kraft (NSE:STOVEKRAFT) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 36% over the last three months.   However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stove Kraft's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested.

Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of Stove Kraft's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE </h2><p> It is hard to argue that Stove Kraft's ROE is much good in and of itself.   An industry comparison shows that the company's ROE is not much different from the industry average of 8.9% either.   Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 10% seen by Stove Kraft over the last five years is not surprising.    </p><p> However, when we compared Stove Kraft's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 16% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9674015-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761871371113\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:STOVEKRAFT Past Earnings Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Stove Kraft is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Stove Kraft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> When we piece together Stove Kraft's low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (where it is retaining 75% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth.  This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Only recently, Stove Kraft stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we have mixed feelings about Stove Kraft.      While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> Korean Reinsurance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Korean Reinsurance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761871433884\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Korean Reinsurance is not owned by hedge funds.      Our data shows that In-Soon Jang is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding.       Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.      Additionally, the company's CEO Jong-Gyu Won directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.   </p> <p> On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.  </p> <p> While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Korean Reinsurance</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Korean Reinsurance Company.   It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful ‚Ç©446b stake in this ‚Ç©1.9t business.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Korean Reinsurance.   This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Korean Reinsurance better, we need to consider many other factors. </p> <p> <strong>I like to dive deeper</strong> into how a company has performed in the past.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making.  But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.  A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>).

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ‚Çπ342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ‚Çπ268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears‚Äô focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company‚Äôs financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine‚Äôs expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company‚Äôs inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine‚Äôs filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company‚Äôs current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company‚Äôs discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "title": "Jindal Steel Limited (NSE:JINDALSTEL) Just Reported Second-Quarter Earnings: Have Analysts Changed Their Mind On The Stock?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Investors in <strong>Jindal Steel Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:JINDALSTEL</a>) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.1% to close at ‚Çπ1,070 following the release of its second-quarter results.       It was a workmanlike result, with revenues of ‚Çπ117b coming in 4.9% ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share of ‚Çπ27.83, in line with analyst appraisals.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If met, it would imply a notable 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 110% to ‚Çπ56.56.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ‚Çπ566.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of ‚Çπ61.65 in 2026.        So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Jindal Steel </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target held steady at ‚Çπ1,093, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.        Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation.  There are some variant perceptions on Jindal Steel, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at ‚Çπ1,400 and the most bearish at ‚Çπ600 per share.   Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/materials/metals-mining\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's clear from the latest estimates that Jindal Steel's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 30% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.6% p.a. over the past five years.    Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 11% annually.  Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Jindal Steel is expected to grow much faster than its industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results.        Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   We have estimates - from multiple Jindal Steel analysts - going out to 2028, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> You should always think about risks though.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>SK hynix</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) √∑ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ‚Ç©32t √∑ (‚Ç©129t - ‚Ç©25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is.  As with many other companies <strong>PDS Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PDSL</a>) makes use of debt.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is PDS's Net Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2025 PDS had debt of ‚Çπ11.0b, up from ‚Çπ9.76b in one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of ‚Çπ10.5b, its net debt is less, at about ‚Çπ530.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/225670672-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761871252616\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PDSL Debt to Equity History October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is PDS' Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, PDS had liabilities of ‚Çπ29.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of ‚Çπ2.44b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of ‚Çπ10.5b and ‚Çπ14.2b worth of receivables due within a year.   So it has liabilities totalling ‚Çπ6.87b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, PDS has a  market capitalization of ‚Çπ52.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.    Carrying virtually no net debt, PDS has a very light debt load indeed.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for PDS </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> PDS has a very low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.15 so it is strange to see weak interest coverage, with last year's EBIT being only 2.4 times the interest expense.  So while we're not necessarily alarmed we think that its debt is far from trivial.        Unfortunately, PDS's EBIT flopped 13% over the last four quarters.  If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine PDS's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, PDS produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for PDS was the fact that it seems able handle its debt, based on its EBITDA, confidently.  However, our other observations weren't so heartening.   In particular, interest cover gives us cold feet.       When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about PDS's use of debt.  While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.
