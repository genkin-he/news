The February drill results and launch of a 50,000‑metre program, now guided by Objectivity’s data analytics, slot directly into the near‑term catalysts: an updated Mineral Resource Estimate and further definition of higher‑grade zones that could influence future economic studies. With the share price already up very sharply over the past year and equity financing heavily funding this work, the new assays look directionally supportive rather than thesis‑changing on their own. The bigger swing factors remain resource quality, permitting, and continued access to capital if drilling and studies take longer or cost more than expected.</p> However, investors should also weigh how reliant the story still is on fresh equity funding.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our comprehensive valuation report</a> raises the possibility that Omai Gold Mines is priced higher than what may be justified by its financials.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c6b53872-2855-4958-bf1d-0d4b71bd06c8/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Three Simply Wall St Community valuations span roughly US$9.70 billion to US$97.00 billion, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

The CEO transition to James O’Sullivan looks gradual and internally driven, so it is unlikely to materially change the near term focus on earnings growth and capital returns, but it does sit against the ongoing risk that insurance and wealth management face regulatory and competitive pressure.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the ongoing share repurchases of 7,700,000 shares for CA$368,000,000 between February and November 2025 stand out as most relevant, because they reinforce Power’s emphasis on capital discipline while earnings are forecast to grow at mid single digit rates.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering whether Dropbox is a bargain or just fairly priced at its current level? This article walks through what the numbers are saying about the stock's value.</li> <li>Dropbox shares last closed at US$24.43, with returns of a 1.2% decline over 7 days, 7.9% decline over 30 days, 9.3% decline year to date, 5.9% decline over 1 year, 18.2% over 3 years and 6.0% over 5 years, which may have some investors reassessing the balance between opportunity and risk.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Dropbox has focused on its position as a mature cloud storage and collaboration platform and how investors weigh that against other software names. This helps frame the recent share price performance. Alongside that, ongoing discussion about competition in cloud services and productivity tools has kept attention on how much value the market is currently willing to assign to Dropbox.</li> <li>On our framework, Dropbox scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6 valuation score</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about US$928.9 million. Analyst estimates and Simply Wall St extrapolations project free cash flow of roughly US$931.0 million in 2026 and US$1,296.6 million in 2035, with values between those years laid out in the ten year projection set.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$59.33 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$24.43, the DCF output suggests the stock trades at a 58.8% discount, which points to Dropbox looking undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Dropbox is undervalued by 58.8%.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Dropbox currently trades on a P/E of 11.59x. That sits well below the Software industry average of 25.78x and also below the peer group average of 22.86x. To sharpen this comparison, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 20.38x, which is the P/E level the model suggests for Dropbox given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple industry or peer comparison because it adjusts for Dropbox’s own characteristics instead of assuming it should trade exactly like the average software name. Setting the Fair Ratio of 20.38x against the actual 11.59x P/E implies the shares are pricing in a lower multiple than the model suggests might be appropriate.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:DBX P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d063deed-e62e-44b0-b653-07cd40ec368f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:DBX P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives on the Community page to attach your own story about Dropbox to a set of revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, link that story to a fair value, then compare it with the current price to help decide whether you see Dropbox as closer to the higher US$30 or lower US$20 fair value cases. The Narrative automatically updates as new news or earnings arrive so your view stays connected to the latest information rather than a static spreadsheet.</p> <p>For Dropbox, here are previews of two leading Dropbox narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/3dq9x53g-ai-dash-and-hybrid-work-will-redefine-digital-collaboration?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Dropbox Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 18.6% below the narrative fair value at the recent US$24.43 share price</p> <p>Revenue trend used in this narrative: 29.8% annual decline</p> <ul> <li>Assumes Dropbox successfully leans into AI led products like Dash and workflow tools for enterprises, supporting higher margins and long term cash generation.</li> <li>Builds in an expectation that share buybacks reduce the share count meaningfully, which supports earnings per share even with a soft revenue trend.</li> <li>Identifies long term potential if management can keep investing in AI tools while holding on to profitability, with churn, competition and a shrinking paid user base as key risks.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/99qpy6jn-teams-churn-and-ai-delays-will-depress-revenue?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Dropbox Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$20.00 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value: 22.2% above the narrative fair value at the recent US$24.43 share price</p> <p>Revenue trend used in this narrative: 157.2% annual decline</p> <ul> <li>Assumes elevated churn in Teams customers, reduced investment in non core lines and headwinds in outbound sales that keep pressure on revenue and earnings.</li> <li>Treats the shift from mature file storage into AI tools like Dash as a source of execution uncertainty, with slower contribution from new products and sensitivity to currency moves.</li> <li>Views the current price as demanding, based on a fair value anchor of US$20.00 that already factors in profitability, buybacks and some benefit from AI, while still highlighting competition and growth risk.</li> </ul> <p>These two narratives bracket the recent share price by using different assumptions about revenue trends, margins and how much credit Dropbox earns for its AI initiatives and capital returns. The useful next step is to decide which set of assumptions feels closer to how you see the business, or to shape your own view somewhere between the two.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Recent moves may reflect shifting views on Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' growth potential in rare disease treatments and how investors balance that against risks and valuation.</p> <p>If Rhythm Pharmaceuticals has caught your eye, it could be a good moment to see what else is setting the pace in the sector via our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 healthcare AI stocks</a>.</p> <p>With Rhythm trading at US$99.15, an intrinsic value estimate at a discount, and a sizeable gap to the US$141.80 analyst target, you have to ask: is this a genuine mispricing or is future growth already fully reflected?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 24.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' most followed valuation narrative pegs fair value at $131.50, comfortably above the recent $99.15 close. This raises clear questions about what is priced in around rare disease obesity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals enters late February 2026 as the leader in \"rare disease obesity,\" a niche that has remained remarkably insulated from the broader GLP-1 price wars. The company’s core asset, Setmelanotide, has seen rapid uptake in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and POMC deficiency, where traditional weight-loss drugs often fail.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>It is worth examining how a single rare disease franchise supports that higher fair value. The narrative leans heavily on scaling revenue, future margins and a shift to sustained profitability, and it is important to understand which specific cash flow assumptions are most influential.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $131.50 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_user_generated_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the story could change quickly if key Phase 3 programs disappoint, or if the current annual net loss of about US$197.7m forces fresh equity raises.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-rytm/rhythm-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Rhythm Pharmaceuticals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: rich sales multiple despite DCF upside</h2> <p>Our DCF model suggests Rhythm could be trading below future cash flow value at $448.88 per share, which supports the undervalued narrative.

The recent surge in returns and very low price to earnings multiple are attractive on the surface, but they also sit alongside large one off gains and a fund that generates limited recurring revenue. Saba Capital’s renewed push for a comprehensive strategic review adds a fresh near term catalyst around the discount to net asset value, fee structure, and even the fund’s offshore setup, but it also injects more uncertainty into an already volatile vehicle with a relatively inexperienced board. The activism could prove material, yet it may not change the core reality that ASA’s fortunes remain tightly tied to swings in gold equities.</p> However, one governance risk in particular is something investors should not ignore.\n\nASA Gold and Precious Metals' shares are on the way up, but could they be overextended? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how much higher they are than fair value</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/530981a7-5ecc-48bb-9ea8-c64c17ef3d80/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community currently has 1 fair value estimate around US$42.72, yet recent activism and governance turnover may matter more for ASA’s path than any single model suggests, so you should weigh multiple viewpoints.<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/diversified-financials/nyse-asa/asa-gold-and-precious-metals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore another fair value estimate on ASA Gold and Precious Metals</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as $42.72!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with this assessment?

The current 31.9% margin alongside trailing EPS of US$12.00 gives some backing to that bullish view, even as:\n    <ul> <li>Same restaurant sales growth in 2025 swung from a 1% decline in Q1 to positive growth of 3.8% and 3.6% in Q2 and Q3, showing mixed traffic trends beneath the margin stability.</li> <li>Net income over the last four quarters moved in a relatively tight range between US$1.9b and US$2.3b, which fits the idea of steady earnings but not rapid acceleration.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>McDonald's Future Earnings Per Share Growth</p> <h2>Store base tops 44,000 with mixed traffic</h2> <ul> <li>Total restaurants increased from 43,756 in Q1 2025 to 44,599 by Q3 2025, while same restaurant sales growth moved from a 1% decline in Q1 to gains of 3.8% in Q2 and 3.6% in Q3.</li> <li>Bears highlight the risk that declining low income traffic and market saturation could pressure U.S. revenues. The swing from a 1.5% decline in same restaurant sales in Q3 2024 to positive mid single digit growth in 2025 supports the idea that traffic is not uniformly weak, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The reliance on higher same restaurant sales growth to support future earnings means any renewed traffic softness could limit how much benefit McDonald's gets from its larger 44,000 plus store base.</li> <li>Concerns about market saturation and franchisee economics remain relevant, because unit growth from 42,819 restaurants in Q3 2024 to 44,599 in Q3 2025 needs to be matched by healthy guest counts to sustain systemwide sales.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Critics who focus on traffic risk may want to see how that concern stacks up against the numbers in the dedicated bear case for McDonald's, which digs into same restaurant sales trends, cost pressures, and unit growth assumptions. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 McDonald's Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Premium valuation above DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$333.01, McDonald's trades at a trailing P/E of 27.6x versus the US Hospitality industry average of 23.2x, sits below the peer average of 55.8x, and is above a DCF fair value estimate of about US$242.21.</li> <li>Supportive investors point to 5 year annual earnings growth of 8.3% and forecast earnings growth of roughly 6.8% per year. Those figures, combined with a 2.23% dividend yield and a 31.9% net margin, heavily support the bullish case that a premium P/E can be justified, even as:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the current share price of US$333.01 and the DCF fair value of about US$242.21 underlines the risk that some buyers are paying above modeled cash flow value.</li> <li>Forecast revenue growth of about 5.1% per year is not especially high, so a 27.6x P/E relies on confidence that margins and earnings growth near 6.8% can be maintained.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you're trying to decide whether that premium price tag fits with your own expectations for growth and cash generation, it can help to see how bullish investors frame the long term story around digital, margins, and capital returns in one place. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 McDonald's Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/8bb6ppxs-mcdonalds-a-fundamental-and-historical-valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for McDonald's on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Feeling torn between the bullish and cautious takes here?

(NYSE:OMF) is drawing increased attention for its role in consumer finance, and its presence in the Russell 1000 index reflects growing institutional interest.</li> <li>The company’s focus on personalized lending services is standing out against peers and reinforcing its position in the consumer finance segment.</li> <li>Recent stock data shows NYSE:OMF closed at $56.37, with a 1 year return of 14.6% and a 3 year return of 67.9%.</li> </ul> <p>For investors watching consumer lenders, OneMain Holdings sits at an interesting crossroads. The stock trades at $56.37 and has delivered a 14.6% return over the past year and a 67.9% return over the past 3 years, which helps frame how the market has been treating the stock so far. Its inclusion in the Russell 1000 index and the associated institutional presence add another layer of attention around the name.</p> <p>What is especially relevant now is how OneMain’s personalized lending approach is helping it stand out within consumer finance. As institutional holders stay engaged and the company continues to serve a broad base of borrowers, investors may focus on how that model compares with other listed lenders. This article looks at what that growing interest might mean for those tracking NYSE:OMF today.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-omf/onemain-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OneMain Holdings</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This indicates investors have been responding positively to both recent earnings news and earlier corporate moves.</p> <p>If Hafnia’s recent update has you looking at shipping and energy exposure more closely, it can be a good moment to broaden your search with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">98 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <p>With Hafnia trading at NOK 69.14 against an analyst price target of NOK 74.25 and an intrinsic value estimate that appears materially higher, the big question is whether this signals an opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 5.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>Hafnia’s most followed narrative puts fair value at NOK 73.33 versus the NOK 69.14 last close.

Ferguson’s involvement in large capital projects positions it well for continued growth in this diversified segment, which should help improve margins as the business scales.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bw4fdt4y-organic-share-gains-and-non-residential-strength-will-support-upside-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how a distributor earns a premium valuation tag? This narrative leans heavily on compounding revenue, thicker margins, and a future earnings multiple that assumes real staying power.

Using that approach, future cash flows line up closer to $219 per share, which makes the current $260.66 price appear expensive.

The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $1.27b. Analysts provide explicit Free Cash Flow estimates for the earlier years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out, with projected Free Cash Flow of $2.89b in 2030. Each of these future cash flows is discounted back to today and added together.</p> <p>On this basis, the DCF output suggests an estimated intrinsic value of US$28.51 per share, compared with the recent share price of US$18.36. That gap implies the stock is 35.6% undervalued according to this model. This indicates a meaningful margin between price and estimated value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coupang is undervalued by 35.6%.

It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are willing to pay today for one dollar of current earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E really depends on how the market views a company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while lower growth expectations or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E being reasonable.</p> <p>Coupang is trading on a P/E of 86x. That is well above the Multiline Retail industry average of 19.65x and also above the peer average of 28.99x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Coupang, which is 36.15x, estimates what P/E might be appropriate after considering factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry because it adjusts for those company specific drivers instead of assuming one size fits all. With Coupang’s actual P/E of 86x versus the Fair Ratio of 36.15x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This is a simple way for you to attach a clear story about Coupang’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a set of forecasts and a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to today’s price directly on Simply Wall St’s Community page, where Narratives are updated as new earnings or news arrives and can differ widely. For example, one Coupang Narrative may anchor around a fair value near the lower analyst end of about US$22.80 and another around the upper end near US$40.00. This gives you a structured way to decide how your own view lines up with the market.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Coupang? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CPNG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-cpng/coupang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/92fa9f91-b6f0-4e02-abd0-a65beee4a53c/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CPNG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The Renergen acquisition and production update put execution at the Virginia project front and center, with management openly targeting positive operational cash flow by late 2026. In that context, the Emerging Growth Virtual Conference appearance looks more like an investor-relations catalyst than a fundamental one: helpful for shaping the story, but unlikely on its own to change near-term cash burn, project timing, or balance sheet risk. With a volatile share price, rich price to book, and expectations of high revenue growth, the bigger questions still sit around delivering on operational milestones and managing funding needs without further eroding existing shareholders.</p> However, there is one financing and dilution risk here that investors really should understand.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on ASP Isotopes</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8686b2df-74f7-4596-899d-4091f07eee9a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> You are seeing ten different fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community, ranging from well under US$1 to very large upside estimates above US$70.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings at around US$253.37 still offers value after a strong run, you are not alone.</li> <li>The stock has returned 2.7% over the last 7 days, 15.8% over 30 days, 44.8% year to date and 113.5% over 1 year, with a very large 3 year and 5 year return of 268.1% and 300.7% respectively. This naturally raises questions about what is already priced in.</li> <li>These moves have kept MACOM in focus as investors reassess where it fits within the wider semiconductor space and what current optimism implies for future expectations. Recent coverage has largely revolved around its positioning in the sector and whether its share price performance is aligned with its fundamentals.</li> <li>Despite this strong share price history, MACOM currently scores 0 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown in our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation scorecard</a>.

It focuses on the cash the business may generate for shareholders rather than accounting earnings.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $151.8 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further figures out to 2035, including a projected free cash flow of $945.6 million in 2035.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $114.39 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $253.37, this output suggests the stock is 121.5% above this particular estimate of intrinsic value based on the model’s cash flow scenario.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings may be overvalued by 121.5%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. A higher P/E can reflect stronger expected growth or lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E can point to more muted growth expectations or higher uncertainty.</p> <p>MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings is trading on a P/E of 117.26x. That sits well above the Semiconductor industry average of 44.48x and also above the peer average of 39.25x. On the surface, that kind of gap suggests investors are paying a much higher price for each dollar of earnings than is typical for the sector or for similar companies.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for MACOM, at 38.30x, is designed to be a more tailored yardstick than a simple peer or industry comparison. It incorporates factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, margins, size and risk characteristics, then estimates what would be a reasonable P/E given those inputs. Because it looks at company specific drivers as well as its sector and market cap, it aims to be a more rounded guide to what might be considered a balanced valuation range.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 117.26x with the Fair Ratio of 38.30x points to MACOM trading well above that model based assessment.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might lean toward the more cautious US$160.00 fair value with 14.65% annual revenue growth, a 28.48% profit margin and a future P/E of 40.08x. By comparing each Narrative’s fair value with the current share price you can see which story, if any, lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Narratives:</p> <p>Each one takes the same business data and applies a different set of expectations, so you can quickly see which assumptions feel closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/i4lpvwos-ai-and-5g-demand-will-shape-future-semiconductor-landscape-02wu?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$255.73</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 0.9% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 16.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish case leans on MACOM’s exposure to AI, 5G, data center and SATCOM demand, with those end markets expected to support revenue growth and higher margins over time.</li> <li>It assumes that operational work at the RTP fab and across the manufacturing footprint eventually supports higher gross and operating margins, while R&amp;D and M&amp;A are used to support new optical and RF products.</li> <li>The fair value of about US$255.73 reflects those growth and margin expectations, together with a future P/E assumption and a discount rate of 10.53%, and sits close to where the shares most recently traded.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/91okis49-update-for-macom-technology-solutions-holdings?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 58.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 14.65% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bearish case focuses on execution and cycle risks, highlighting MACOM’s reliance on data center optical ramps, carrier capex and defense programs, and the possibility that new fab capacity is underutilized.</li> <li>It assumes revenue still grows and margins improve, but that the market may be assigning too high a P/E multiple relative to those earnings, especially if product ramps or customer programs are slower than expected.</li> <li>The fair value of US$160.00 is based on those more cautious assumptions and sits well below the recent share price, which implies that expectations embedded in the current price are demanding in this scenario.</li> </ul> <p>Putting these side by side shows how much the outcome for MACOM depends on your confidence in future growth, margin progress and capital deployment.
