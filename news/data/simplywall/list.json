Despite big moves in the sector and recent expansion of its power management and imaging technology portfolio, ON Semiconductor’s 1-year total shareholder return has slumped to -30.2%. Its 5-year total return is still up nearly 99%.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

The renewed optimism about a US-China trade truce could ease Levi's cost pressures, potentially becoming the most important short-term catalyst, while ongoing exposure to tariff fluctuations and slow progress in China remain significant risks. The overall impact of the recent news on these factors appears material for near-term profitability and international momentum.</p> <p>One recent announcement that stands out is the launch of the Blue Tab collection, aiming to reinforce Levi's product diversity by appealing both to premium shoppers and value seekers.

BioInvent International AB (publ), a clinical-stage company, discovers and develops immuno-modulatory antibodies for the treatment of cancer in Sweden, Europe, the United States, and internationally.    The kr2.0b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of kr429m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of kr292m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven.    Many investors are wondering about the rate at which BioInvent International will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?”  In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><p> According to the 2 industry analysts covering BioInvent International, the consensus is that breakeven is near.   They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of kr198m in 2026.   The company is therefore projected to breakeven  just over a year from now.    How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2026? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 51% year-on-year, on average,    which is rather optimistic!  If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/139682-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798510469\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BINV Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of BioInvent International's upcoming projects,  though,  take into account  that by and large   biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow.

BioInvent International currently has no debt on its balance sheet,  which is quite unusual for a cash-burning  biotech,   which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity.  This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden.

In fact, HAKI Safety increased the number of shares on issue by 9.1% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares.  Therefore, each share now receives a smaller portion of profit.  To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to <em>per share</em> value.  Check out HAKI Safety's historical EPS growth by <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clicking on this link</a>. </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Is Dilution Impacting HAKI Safety's Earnings Per Share (EPS)? </h2><p> Unfortunately, HAKI Safety's profit is down 57% per year over three years.    The good news is that profit was up 2.6% in the last twelve months.   On the other hand, earnings <em>per share</em> are pretty much flat, over the last twelve months.      So you can see that the dilution has had a bit of an impact on shareholders.   </p><p> In the long term, earnings <em>per share</em> growth should beget share price growth.  So it will certainly be a positive for shareholders if HAKI Safety can grow EPS persistently.   However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit.  For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow. </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On HAKI Safety's Profit Performance</h2><p> Each HAKI Safety share now gets a meaningfully smaller slice of its overall profit, due to dilution of existing shareholders.      Because of this, we think that it may be that HAKI Safety's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     If you'd like to know more about HAKI Safety as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 26% shows it's noticeably less attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that MVV Energie's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of MVV Energie revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its low P/E, given they look worse than current market expectations.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-mvv1/mvv-energie-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for MVV Energie</strong></a> (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> If these <strong>risks are making you reconsider your opinion on MVV Energie</strong>, explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/206/big-green-snowflakes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of high quality stocks</a> to get an idea of what else is out there. </p></div>",

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Arjo to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Arjo's Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Arjo's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Arjo's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential!    On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Arjo has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore these.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Arjo's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in.  But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%.  For example, the <strong>Graphite India Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:GRAPHITE</a>) share price has soared 258% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.    And in the last month, the share price has gained 16%.      </p><p> Since the stock has added ₹14b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During the five years of share price growth, Graphite India moved from a loss to profitability.   That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.  </p><p> You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882655-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798692283\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:GRAPHITE Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies.

Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Graphite India's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">earnings, revenue and cash flow</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR).  The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, Graphite India's TSR for the last 5 years was 292%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Graphite India shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   That's including the dividend.    However, that falls short of the 31% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.       While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Take risks, for example - Graphite India has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Indian exchanges.</em></p></div>",

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.

Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   If Neobo Fastigheter doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.   </p><p> <strong>Note:</strong> we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-neobo/neobo-fastigheter-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Neobo Fastigheter</a>. </p> <h2>Our Take On Neobo Fastigheter's Profit Performance</h2><p> Because unusual items detracted from Neobo Fastigheter's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter.      Because of this, we think Neobo Fastigheter's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-neobo/neobo-fastigheter-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neobo Fastigheter is showing <strong>3 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 2 of those are a bit concerning...   </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Neobo Fastigheter's profit.

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.

Because of this, we think Swedencare's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!      The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future.  At Simply Wall St, we have analyst estimates which <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-secare/swedencare-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you can view by clicking here</a>. </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Swedencare's profit.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

This points to a near-balanced view on valuation, with a slight upside according to popular assumptions. Here is one of the pivotal arguments supporting this outlook:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The rollout and completion of major LNG export projects (ECA Phase 1 nearing completion, Port Arthur Phase 1 advancing, and strong commercial momentum for Phase 2) positions Sempra to benefit from sustained global demand for U.S. LNG as a transition fuel, significantly increasing future cash flows and long-term revenue generation.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/uhdym875-analysts-lift-sempra-price-target-as-margins-improve-and-long-term-eps-guidance-reaffirmed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how such ambitious projects shape this valuation story?

You’re not the only one asking these questions right now.\n  </li> <li> After a 4.3% pop over the last 30 days, PepsiCo’s shares have still logged a -8.7% return over the past year. This has made for a bumpy ride and is drawing plenty of attention from value-focused investors.\n  </li> <li> Recent headlines highlight PepsiCo’s push into healthier products and big sustainability investments.

This approach aims to reveal what PepsiCo might truly be worth, based on how much money it is expected to generate over time.</p> <p>For PepsiCo, the most recent twelve months of Free Cash Flow came in at $6.4 Billion. Analysts forecast consistent growth, projecting Free Cash Flow to reach $11.4 Billion by the end of 2027. Looking further out, using Simply Wall St’s extrapolations, PepsiCo’s Free Cash Flow could rise to nearly $15 Billion by 2035. These figures reflect a steady upward trajectory in the company’s ability to generate cash, with analysts directly estimating the first five years and later years forecasted using trend-based calculations.</p> <p>The resulting intrinsic value from this DCF analysis is $223.84 per share. Based on the current share price, this represents a 34.7% discount, suggesting that PepsiCo stock is significantly undervalued by the market right now.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PepsiCo is undervalued by 34.7%.

Because earnings are the direct result of a company’s operations, comparing a company’s stock price to its earnings provides investors with a simple gauge of how much they’re paying for each dollar of profit.</p> <p>However, not all PE ratios should be treated equally. What counts as a “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors, including a company’s expected earnings growth, the risks it faces, and overall market conditions. Fast-growing or lower-risk companies often deserve a higher PE, while slower-growing or riskier businesses tend to trade at lower multiples.</p> <p>PepsiCo’s current PE ratio stands at 27.7x. This is above the average for the Beverage industry, which is 17.3x, and higher than the average for its peers at 25.3x. While these comparisons offer some context, Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” takes things further. The Fair Ratio for PepsiCo, calculated at 29.3x, quantifies the PE you’d expect for a stock with PepsiCo’s unique combination of growth prospects, risk profile, profit margin, market cap, and sector. This delivers a more tailored and meaningful benchmark than generic industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Because PepsiCo’s actual PE ratio of 27.7x is quite close to its Fair Ratio of 29.3x, the stock looks to be valued about right by the market at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PepsiCo Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is the story you, as an investor, tell about PepsiCo based on your view of its future. This story combines your forecasts for revenue, profit margins, or growth with your own sense of what the company’s fair value should be.</p> <p>Narratives bridge the gap between hard numbers and real-world context. They help you connect the company’s business story, such as new markets, product launches, or emerging risks, to a tailored financial forecast so you can decide what PepsiCo is truly worth to you. Narratives are easy to use and accessible right on Simply Wall St’s Community page, trusted by millions of investors. They allow you to anchor your investment decision around your assumptions. For example, when the Narrative’s fair value you set is above the current price, the stock could be a buy, and vice versa.</p> <p>What’s unique is that as new information comes in, such as a quarterly result, a major news announcement, or a shift in consumer trends, Narratives automatically update to reflect the latest data instantly. For example, among PepsiCo Narratives shared by investors, the most optimistic currently sees fair value above $160 per share driven by global expansion and digitalization, while the most cautious pegs it near $115 based on slower health product uptake and margin pressures.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PepsiCo? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Recent leadership changes and missed forecasts have fueled intense risk aversion, erasing much of the stock’s prior gains and dragging its year-to-date share price return to negative 66%. Over the last year, shareholders have endured a total return loss of roughly 65%, and multi-year performance shows meaningful underperformance.

While the company’s net profit margin remains elevated at 32.8%, it is down from 38.5% the year before, and earnings are now projected to fall around 25.1% per year over the coming three years after a period of strong 16.9% annualized growth. Shares currently trade at €7.26, notably below an internally estimated fair value of €16.05, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.6x, much lower than its peers and the wider European industry. Investors are taking note of the stock’s attractive valuation and high-quality historical earnings, but the outlook is clouded by shrinking margins and declining profitability ahead.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fi/diversified-financials/hel-taala/taaleri-oyj-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Taaleri Oyj.</a> <p>Next, we will see how these earnings figures compare to the widely followed narratives around Taaleri, and whether the fundamentals support or challenge the story investors have been telling.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/fm8cp88r-renewable-and-bioindustry-trends-will-shape-a-risky-future-8nz8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Taaleri Oyj</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fi/diversified-financials/hel-taala/taaleri-oyj-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLSE:TAALA Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/77882e61-93df-4bf9-84ef-b37500485b43/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLSE:TAALA Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Management Fees Supported by Renewable Energy Demand</h2> <ul> <li>Strong client appetite for renewable energy and bioindustry assets is boosting Taaleri’s management fee income.
