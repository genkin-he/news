The story is still binary around clinical and regulatory milestones, especially the upcoming EXPLORE-OSA and EXPLORE-CKD readouts and the planned NDA filing. The new US$113.58 million shelf registration tied to ESOP-related shares looks more like financial housekeeping than a major shift in the thesis, but it does underscore the likelihood of further equity usage in a company that is pre-revenue, unprofitable, and not expected to reach profitability in the near term. In the short run, the main catalysts and risks still hinge on lorundrostat data quality, regulatory feedback and future capital raises.</p> However, investors should also weigh the risk of further dilution alongside these clinical milestones.\n\nMineralys Therapeutics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bbd189de-48d6-4798-a6f0-f98a74374c70/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$41 million to a very large US$413 million, reflecting sharply different expectations for Mineralys’ potential.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>The Nvidia-led cybersecurity partnership puts Siemens closer to the core of AI-powered protection for industrial automation, where operational technology has historically been harder to secure than traditional IT. By embedding AI security directly into control systems, Siemens is tying its automation hardware and software more tightly to Nvidia’s data processing units and to partners like Palo Alto Networks and Forescout. For you as an investor, this points to deeper integration across the product stack and potentially stickier customer relationships, especially in sectors such as utilities, transport and advanced manufacturing. On the energy side, Siemens’ presence in controlled environment agriculture and microgrids links its grid, controls and digital offerings to areas where reliability and efficiency are central buying criteria. Taken together, these moves position the company alongside peers such as Schneider Electric, ABB and GE Vernova in key areas of industrial digitalization and power resilience. The partnership approach also helps Siemens stay connected to AI and cybersecurity advances without carrying all the development risk alone.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Siemens Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The AI-powered cybersecurity collaboration directly supports the narrative’s focus on industrial AI and digital automation as drivers of recurring, higher margin software and services revenue.</li> <li>Greater reliance on partners and complex industrial AI stacks could increase execution and integration risk, which lines up with concerns in the narrative about large technology transitions weighing on profitability if rollouts are slower or more costly than expected.</li> <li>The emphasis on controlled environment agriculture and microgrids extends Siemens’ role in electrification and data center adjacent energy infrastructure, which is only partially reflected in the existing focus on hyperscaler demand and grid solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/awgw458i-analysts-debate-siemens-growth-and-valuation-amid-modest-fair-value-increase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Siemens</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Integrating AI-driven cybersecurity into industrial automation and coordinating with multiple partners may increase execution complexity and the risk of cost overruns on large projects.</li> <li>⚠️ Expanding in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture exposes Siemens to policy, subsidy and project funding risks in newer segments, alongside existing concerns that the company has a high level of debt.</li> <li>🎁 The AI cybersecurity partnership and microgrid offerings aim at markets where Siemens already supplies automation, grid equipment and digital tools, which can support cross selling and longer customer relationships.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts highlight several strengths including value, profit and revenue growth and a reliable dividend, which provide context as Siemens targets growing markets such as industrial AI, microgrids and controlled environment agriculture.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track how quickly Siemens and Nvidia translate their AI cybersecurity plans into commercial deployments across factories, grids and transport systems, and whether customers adopt embedded security as standard in new automation projects. In energy infrastructure, watch for contract wins in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture, especially where Siemens can bundle power distribution, control systems and digital monitoring. It is also worth keeping an eye on how these initiatives show up in Siemens’ order intake mix and whether management commentary links them to recurring software or service revenue, compared with more traditional equipment sales.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Siemens, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SIE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Siemens</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>TTM net income moved from a loss of US$33.4 million in Q4 2024 to a smaller loss of US$18.6 million in Q4 2025, so the company is closer to break even but not yet there.</li> <li>Quarterly figures inside that period swung from a US$13.1 million profit in Q3 2025 to a US$48.3 million loss in Q4 2025, which challenges the idea of a smooth path toward the bullish earnings forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, bulls are essentially arguing that a business still reporting a TTM loss can grow into those forecasts relatively quickly, which is an optimistic read on how fast profitability can improve. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/l3rwv1up-us-and-eu-refining-will-fuel-a-green-metals-boom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 AMG Critical Materials Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>US$48.3 million Q4 loss vs earlier 2025 profits</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, AMG moved from net income of US$5.0 million, US$11.5 million and US$13.1 million in Q1, Q2 and Q3 to a net loss of US$48.3 million in Q4, even as quarterly revenue stayed in a fairly tight band between US$388.1 million and US$446.6 million.</li> <li>Bears highlight that heavy capital spending and exposure to commodity prices can hit earnings hard, and this pattern fits that cautious view because:\n    <ul> <li>Losses over the past five years have widened at roughly 6% per year and the latest TTM period still ends in the red, which lines up with concerns about long stretches of uneven profitability.</li> <li>Interest payments are flagged as not well covered by earnings, so a quarter like Q4 2025 with a US$48.3 million loss adds weight to worries about financial pressure if similar periods repeat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics point to this swing back into a sizeable loss as evidence that the path to steady profits may be rougher than headline growth forecasts imply. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Materials Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Low P/S and DCF fair value create valuation tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of €33.04, AMG is trading on a P/S of 0.7x compared with peer and industry averages of 5.7x and 0.9x, and sits well below a DCF fair value estimate of €60.83.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests the stock looks inexpensive while still facing meaningful financial risk, and the data backs both sides of that tension because:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the €33.04 price and the €60.83 DCF fair value points to valuation support, even after factoring in that analysts as a group only see roughly 25.6% implied upside to their price target of €41.49.</li> <li>At the same time, the company remains unprofitable on a TTM basis and interest coverage is described as weak, so any case that the current P/S discount is attractive also needs to factor in these ongoing balance sheet and earnings risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie

This raises questions about how quickly capital projects and regulatory outcomes will flow through to earnings.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative highlights multi year capital plans of about US$3b and a pipeline of over 3,000 megawatts of potential new load as drivers for higher margins, while the actual trailing margin improvement from 9.3% to 9.8% is more modest in comparison.</li> <li>At the same time, the trailing 12 month earnings growth figure of roughly 7.2% lines up with the long run 7.4% annualized growth the consensus references, so the earnings side of that story is currently closer to the script than the faster margin lift analysts are hoping for.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Earnings Growth Outpaces Slower Revenue</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew about 7.2% while revenue is forecast at roughly 2% annual growth, and trailing 12 month EPS of US$2.38 on US$1.964b of revenue underscores that most of the progress is coming from profitability rather than rapid top line expansion.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish narrative argue that accelerating electrification and over 3,000 megawatts of large load inquiries can support stronger revenue ahead. However, the current revenue base of about US$1.964b and the 2% revenue growth forecast show a slower build than the more upbeat demand story might suggest.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative talks about potential revenues of US$2.1b and earnings of US$245.2 million by around 2028, but today Avista is at US$1.964b of revenue and US$193 million of net income, which means a meaningful gap still needs to be closed.</li> <li>Analysts also expect EPS of US$2.94 by about 2028 compared with trailing EPS of roughly US$2.38, so while the 7.2% earnings growth rate so far is consistent with that direction, the modest revenue assumptions suggest a heavier reliance on margin and rate outcomes than on pure volume growth.</li> </ul> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that this kind of earnings profile can be vulnerable if large load projects or regulatory approvals slip, so it is worth comparing the current US$2.38 EPS and 7.2% growth to the US$2.94 EPS target investors are building into their expectations before deciding how much risk you are comfortable taking on at a US$40.61 share price relative to the US$41.00 analyst target.</p> <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Avista Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation Support Versus Cash Flow Strain</h2> <ul> <li>Avista trades on a trailing P/E of 17.1x, which is below the Global Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.1x and well below the peer average of 25.5x, while offering a 4.83% dividend yield that is not well covered by free cash flows and interest payments that are not well covered by earnings over the trailing 12 months.</li> <li>Bulls argue that the combination of below peer P/E and expected earnings growth of about 7.4% a year makes the current valuation attractive. However, the flagged risks around cash coverage and interest costs show that the lower multiple and higher yield come with trade offs that investors need to weigh carefully.</li> <ul> <li>The current share price of US$40.61 is close to the US$41.00 consensus analyst target and only slightly above the DCF fair value estimate of about US$37.92, so there is not a large valuation gap that would offset concerns about dividend and interest coverage.</li> <li>At the same time, earnings of US$193 million on US$1.964b of revenue with a 9.8% margin and a 4.83% yield support the idea of a steady utility profile, but the fact that free cash flow does not fully cover\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tw3gqe02-ava-long-term-earnings-growth-will-steady-energy-delivery-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Avista on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Mixed messages in the data, or a balanced risk and reward story that suits your style?

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>Nebius Group’s decision to lean on upfront payments from large customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms shifts part of the financing burden from lenders and equity markets to its own client base. For you as an investor, that means liquidity is tied more closely to contract execution and less to capital market conditions. Long dated agreements and customer prepayments can smooth cash inflows and give clearer visibility over future revenue, but they also concentrate exposure in a small group of hyperscale clients. The aggressive data center build out and the Tavily acquisition indicate that Nebius is trying to move up the stack from pure infrastructure into more software rich, enterprise grade AI cloud services, putting it in more direct competition with Amazon, Alphabet and other cloud providers. That can support pricing power if the platform resonates with developers, yet it raises execution risk around integration, uptime and ongoing capital intensity in an already crowded AI-infrastructure space.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Nebius Group Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The use of upfront customer financing and large multi year contracts directly supports the narrative that Nebius can use partnerships and strong funding access to build recurring revenue around AI focused infrastructure.</li> <li>Heavy reliance on a few very large deals ties into the narrative concern that customer concentration and sector consolidation could make it harder for Nebius to secure diversified, long term earnings streams.</li> <li>The Tavily acquisition and push into full stack AI services adds a software and data layer that is not fully captured in earlier commentary that focused mainly on GPU infrastructure and capacity expansion.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/qronlo1g-nbis-winning-the-dollar174b-microsoft-deal-will-drive-market-outperformance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Nebius Group</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ High capital expenditure for AI focused data centers means Nebius is exposed to cost overruns, deployment delays and changing power or regulatory requirements.</li> <li>⚠️ Dependence on a small number of very large contracts with companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms increases the impact if any single customer changes strategy or scales back usage.</li> <li>🎁 Long term, prepaid agreements with major enterprises can support more predictable cash flows and give management flexibility over how to fund expansion.</li> <li>🎁 Expansion of capacity and the addition of Tavily’s AI search capabilities position Nebius to offer full stack solutions that could appeal to AI developers looking beyond established providers such as Amazon and Alphabet.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth tracking how quickly Nebius converts its contracted backlog into active, revenue producing capacity, and whether new sites come online on the timelines management has outlined. Keep an eye on any updates to the terms or scale of the Microsoft and Meta Platforms agreements, as well as customer diversification beyond these anchor clients.

Over recent halves the company has seen revenue move from A$74.6 million in H2 2024 to A$136.1 million in H1 2025 and A$200.7 million in H2 2025, while basic EPS shifted from A$0.84 to A$0.01 and then A$0.10.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Banco Comercial Português (ENXTLS:BCP) has posted its FY 2025 numbers with fourth quarter revenue of €953.96 million and basic EPS of €0.018, while trailing twelve month revenue sits at about €3.6 billion and basic EPS at €0.069.

The 28.2% margin versus 26% a year earlier lines up with the idea that day to day profitability has held up as that lending mix evolves.</li> <li>At the same time, the large one off charge inside that €1,019 million net income is a reminder that not all of the recent earnings are repeatable, which is exactly the type of earnings quality issue that more cautious investors focus on when they look past headline growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Loan Book And Asset Quality Signal</h2> <ul> <li>Total loans in the quarterly data sit between €37,378.805 million and €56,345.817 million while non performing loans range from €471.239 million to €526.711 million, so problem loans remain a small part of the overall book in absolute terms.</li> <li>Bears worry that pushing harder into SME and corporate lending could eventually lift the cost of risk. Yet the recent quarters show non performing loans moving within a fairly tight band even as the loan book shifts, which so far does not confirm a spike in credit stress.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also flag Mozambique as a source of recurring sovereign risk, and the fact that non performing loans stay under €530 million across the periods given will have them watching closely to see if that holds as provisions against that market play through.</li> <li>For you as an investor, these numbers mean the quality of the assets backing those earnings is something to track each quarter, especially if the bank continues leaning into higher yielding corporate credit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E Premium Versus DCF Gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a 13.4x P/E against a European banks industry average of 11.1x and peer average of 11.6x, yet the current price of €0.924 sits below a DCF fair value of €1.60 and close to the analyst consensus price target of €0.93.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view on valuation point to forecast revenue growth of 5.7% a year and earnings growth of 9.8% a year alongside that €1,019 million of net income, arguing that the higher P/E is partly explained by these growth expectations. Skeptics focus on the richer multiple and the €626 million one off loss when deciding whether the DCF fair value and the small gap to the €0.93 analyst target leave enough margin of safety.\n    <ul> <li>What stands out is that the DCF fair value of €1.60 is well above both the current price and the analyst target, so you are getting two very different valuation signals from the same set of cash flow assumptions and market multiples.</li> <li>If you are trying to reconcile those, it is worth asking whether you are more comfortable leaning on the 13.4x P/E relative to peers or on the implied upside from the DCF, given the recent one off loss and the description of the dividend record as unstable.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, many investors will want to see how the community weighs the higher P/E against the DCF fair value and the recent one off loss, so it can be useful to read the full discussion in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Banco Comercial Português</a>. <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pq3uzo4y-update-for-banco-comercial-portugues\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Banco Comercial Português on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of strong margins and one off risks leaves you unsure, review the details now and form your own view with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/pt/banks/eli-bcp/banco-comercial-portugues-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>Explore Alternatives</h2> <p>For all the solid margins, Banco Comercial Português still carries an unstable dividend record and a large one off loss that raises questions about earnings quality and consistency.</p> <p>If those gaps around income reliability concern you, take a closer look at <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">449 dividend fortresses</a> today so you can focus on companies with stronger, more consistent payouts.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new 15% global tariffs sharpen the near term focus on margins, which were already under pressure, and increase uncertainty around the key catalyst of earnings stabilization. At the same time, they amplify the biggest current risk: further margin compression from higher product costs layered onto already soft profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the recent decision to maintain a quarterly dividend of US$0.41 per share into April 2026 matters. It signals continued capital returns despite weaker recent earnings and elevated cost headwinds. For investors watching catalysts, that dividend commitment sits alongside NIKE’s ongoing supply chain shifts away from China, a process that could influence how much of the tariff shock ultimately flows through to margins and cash flows.</p> <p>Yet, in contrast, investors should also be aware that margin pressure from tariffs and supply chain shifts could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-nke/nike/0qyl1fu8-nke-upcoming-product-refresh-and-channel-cleanup-will-drive-performance-recovery\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on NIKE (it's free!)</a></p><p>NIKE's narrative projects $50.7 billion revenue and $4.4 billion earnings by 2028.

The S$3.59 share price also stands modestly above the S$3.47 DCF fair value.</li> <li>Investors weighing a bullish angle on valuation often see the discount to the 23.1x peer P/E as supportive.

By 2030, projected free cash flow is $3.43b, with intermediate years between 2026 and 2035 ranging from about $2.74b to just over $4.02b before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model suggests an intrinsic value of roughly $121.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $85.33, this implies a 29.7% discount, so the stock screens as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests eBay is undervalued by 29.7%.

It ties directly to what the business is generating today, which is usually easier to interpret than revenue or book value alone.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>eBay currently trades on a P/E of 19.15x. That sits very close to the Multiline Retail industry average P/E of 19.65x, and well below the peer group average of 38.59x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 19.82x, which is the P/E it would expect for eBay after factoring in elements like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the mix of growth, risk and profitability that is specific to eBay. With the current P/E of 19.15x sitting close to the Fair Ratio of 19.82x, the shares look roughly in line with what this model suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/49564d7c-274f-452b-8679-0ec89f77ad9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You can also see exactly what revenue growth, margins, P/E and discount rate each view is using.</p> <p>Because each Narrative compares its fair value to eBay’s current price and automatically refreshes when new news or earnings data are added, you can quickly see whether your story still justifies buying more, trimming, or simply watching from the sidelines, without having to rebuild your model every time something changes.</p> <p>For eBay however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading eBay Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties together revenue, margins, valuation assumptions and risks into a single, consistent story so you can decide which feels closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/wyqsf8vq-ai-and-live-commerce-will-empower-sustainable-recommerce-xa2e?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 eBay Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$102.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 16.4% below</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 7.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on eBay building a leading global recommerce platform in areas like collectibles, fashion and live commerce, supported by AI tools, enhanced payments and managed shipping.</li> <li>Assumes revenue of about US$13.1b and earnings of about US$2.5b by 2028, with profit margins easing slightly and the shares trading on a future P/E of 20.4x, slightly above today but still below the current US Multiline Retail average.</li> <li>Highlights potential upside from stronger network effects, higher margin revenue streams and ongoing buybacks, while flagging risks such as powerful competitors, dependence on focus categories, regulation and the challenge of attracting younger users.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/7yo5adcu-overvalued-marketplace-will-suffer-from-digital-disruption-ywf9?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 eBay Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: about US$69.62</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value: 22.6% above</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 3.77% per year</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes tougher competition from big tech ecosystems and social commerce platforms, together with changing demographics, as headwinds for user growth, engagement and gross merchandise volume.</li> <li>Uses revenue of about US$11.8b and earnings of about US$2.1b by 2028, along with lower profit margins and a future P/E of 18.14x, with the view that current market expectations could be too optimistic at recent prices.</li> <li>Points to regulatory costs, logistics limitations and pressure on take rates as constraints, and also notes potential support from advertising, AI tools, enthusiast buyers and capital returns if these factors develop more favorably than expected.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame a reasonable range of possible outcomes using the same building blocks shown in the DCF and P/E checks. This allows you to adjust the numbers, lean closer to the bull or bear case, and decide where eBay fits in your portfolio.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Zinzino (OM:ZZ B) has just closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of about SEK1.0b and basic EPS of SEK3.41, while trailing twelve month EPS came in at SEK8.95 on revenue of roughly SEK3.3b. Over recent periods, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from SEK705.48m and EPS of SEK1.25 in Q4 2024 to SEK1,035.30m and EPS of SEK3.41 in Q4 2025. This has occurred against a backdrop of trailing twelve month earnings growth of 91.7% and revenue growth forecasts of about 11.2% a year. With net profit margins running at 9.7% and described as supported by high quality earnings, the release sets up a results season where profitability is front and center for investors.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-zz-b/zinzino-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Zinzino.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely followed narratives around Zinzino’s growth, risks, and profitability, and where those stories might need a rethink.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Profit growth over the last 12 months has therefore been much faster than the revenue pace implied by the forecasts.</li> <li>What stands out for a bullish view is how this profit profile lines up with the business story. Trailing net margin is 9.7% versus 7.7% a year earlier, and five year average annual earnings growth is 30%. Together these figures suggest past profitability has scaled faster than the forecast 9.6% annual earnings growth now being used as the reference point.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on recurring wellness demand may point to FY 2025 quarterly net income moving from SEK55.9m in Q1 to SEK123.6m in Q4 as evidence that the model can produce higher absolute profits than a year ago.</li> <li>At the same time, the 11.2% revenue growth forecast sets a more moderate bar than the recent 91.7% earnings growth. This gives bulls and cautious investors very different reference points when they think about how repeatable these margins might be.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Margins at 9.7% put profitability in focus</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month net income of SEK324.3m on SEK3.3b of revenue implies a 9.7% net margin, compared with 7.7% in the prior year period. A larger share of each krona of sales is therefore currently dropping to the bottom line than a year earlier.</li> <li>For investors who worry on the bearish side about direct sales models being fragile, the margin and EPS pattern creates some useful context. Trailing EPS reached SEK8.95, while FY 2025 quarterly EPS moved from around SEK1.61 in Q1 to SEK3.41 in Q4, which suggests that recent profitability has been achieved with consistent positive earnings across the last six reported quarters.\n    <ul> <li>Critics who question earnings durability still have to weigh that concern against the fact that trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% margin are both well above the Swedish market revenue growth forecast of roughly 0.9% a year cited in the data.</li> <li>At the same time, the forecast earnings growth rate of about 9.6% annually is described as modest, so bears may point out that the step up from a 7.7% to 9.7% margin could prove harder to repeat if the business reverts closer to those forecast growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 17.9x and DCF value of SEK358.99 create a valuation gap</h2> <ul> <li>With the shares at SEK152.00, Zinzino trades on a trailing P/E of 17.9x, compared with a European retail distributors industry average of 13.2x and a DCF fair value in the data of SEK358.99. The shares are therefore priced above the industry multiple but well below that modelled value.</li> <li>What is interesting for a general market view is how those valuation markers sit beside the fundamentals. The company combines a 2.63% dividend yield with trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% net margin, which leaves investors deciding whether the premium to the industry P/E and higher recent share price volatility versus the Swedish market are adequately balanced by the gap between SEK152.00 and the SEK358.99 DCF fair value estimate.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on that DCF fair value may argue that paying 17.9x earnings for a business with five year average annual earnings growth of 30% and forecast revenue growth above the Swedish market is still reasonable.</li> <li>More cautious investors could instead highlight the higher P/E versus the industry average and the recent volatility as reasons to be careful about leaning too heavily on any single valuation model when interpreting the current share price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Beneath these headline figures there is a broader story about how different investors are weighing growth, risk, and valuation, so if you want to see how others are connecting the dots, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/OM/ZZ%20B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Zinzino.</strong></a> </p><h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

With TSE:7011 linked to defense platforms and space systems, new headlines about export control risks are prompting investors to reassess where these activities fit within the broader business mix. For you as a shareholder, the key issue is how any additional compliance requirements could affect contracts, timelines, and capital allocation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the main questions center on how MHI adapts its defense and space operations to evolving Japanese policy and international regulations.

Over recent quarters, the company reported revenue of US$14.1b in Q3 FY 2025, US$16.4b in Q4 FY 2025, and US$17.7b in Q4 FY 2026, while quarterly EPS moved from US$1.15 to US$1.23 and then to US$1.58 over the same periods.

However, the data also show forecast revenue growth of about 5.6% per year, which is below the cited 7.6% annual revenue growth that bullish analysts are assuming, so the current run rate does not fully back the more optimistic revenue path.</li> </ul> <h2>Margins Sit At 9.1% While Costs Rise</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, TJX is reported to have a 9.1% net margin, compared with 8.6% previously, on trailing revenue of US$60.4b and net income of about US$5.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on headwinds like wage inflation and foreign exchange, and the guidance that unfavorable FX is expected to trim consolidated sales growth by 1% and EPS growth by 3% fits that concern. Yet the actual trailing margin at 9.1% is already within the 9.2% margin level that bearish analysts build into their 2028 case, which suggests recent profitability is not far from what the cautious view is assuming several years out.\n    <ul> <li>Incremental wage and payroll costs and a projected 10 to 20 basis point drag on pretax margin from FX are exactly the kind of pressures bearish narratives highlight.</li> <li>At the same time, the reported margin improvement from 8.6% to 9.1% indicates those pressures have not prevented TJX from operating at a higher profitability level in the recent period.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how these cost pressures and margin numbers fit into a fuller cautionary story, skeptics have laid out their case in detail here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/m062sds2-fx-and-china-tariffs-will-test-performance-despite-global-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 TJX Companies Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Premium P/E Versus DCF And Targets</h2> <ul> <li>TJX is shown trading on a 31.5x trailing P/E at a share price of US$155.82, with a DCF fair value of US$102.20 and an analyst price target reference of US$167.88, so the stock sits above the modeled cash flow estimate but below that target level.</li> <li>Bulls argue that strong multi year earnings expansion, including 13% earnings growth over the last year and a five year average of 20.5% per year, justifies paying this premium multiple. However, the same data set also shows forecast earnings growth of about 6.48% per year and revenue growth around 5.6% per year, which is slower than broad US market forecasts and makes the 31.5x P/E and the gap to the US Specialty Retail industry average P/E of 20.1x a key tension point for the bullish case.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 9.1% net margin and history of earnings growth support the idea of a high quality business, which bullish narratives lean on when they point to higher future margins.</li> <li>However, the fact that the current market price is above the DCF fair value of US$102.20 while growth forecasts are closer to mid single digits challenges the idea that quality alone explains the premium valuation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls who think TJX deserves that kind of premium multiple can see how the optimistic story is built around these numbers here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 TJX Companies Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for TJX Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this combination of bullish and cautious views leaves you undecided, now may be a good time to review the numbers yourself and determine your own position.
