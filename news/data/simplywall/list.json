Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.</a></p> <p>The lawsuits around ENTRA1 hit the core of how NuScale plans to turn its Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved small modular reactor design into actual projects. Plaintiffs claim NuScale entrusted commercialization and large capital commitments to a partner with no meaningful nuclear track record, while paying ENTRA1 about US$495 million tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority agreement. That sits next to a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million on sales of US$31.48 million and a new US$1b at the market equity offering filing, so legal uncertainty is landing at the same time as heavy cash usage and potential dilution. The recent Romanian approval shows the technology is still finding willing counterparties, but Fluor’s intention to exit and multiple law firms pursuing securities cases add questions around governance and disclosure. For you as an investor, the key issue is whether project partners, regulators and capital providers remain comfortable backing NuScale while these claims work through the courts, which can take years and could involve settlements, higher costs or tighter oversight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The NuScale Power Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The Romanian SMR project approval aligns with the narrative that NuScale’s NRC certified design and partnerships can eventually support commercial deployment and potential future revenue from projects like RoPower.</li> <li>The ENTRA1 focused lawsuits directly challenge the narrative’s reliance on that partner to drive commercialization and funding, and highlight that this dependency could be a key execution weak point.</li> <li>The size and structure of the ENTRA1 payments, along with the follow on US$1b equity filing, may not be fully captured in earlier narrative assumptions about funding sources and cash runway.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/64bqs928-smr-landmark-us-nuclear-agreement-will-shape-commercialization-path-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NuScale Power</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Multiple securities class actions focused on ENTRA1 disclosures could lead to legal costs, management distraction and potential settlements.</li> <li>⚠️ A US$1b follow on equity program, very large ENTRA1 related expenses and Fluor’s planned exit all point to dilution and funding risk that analysts have already flagged.</li> <li>🎁 NuScale holds NRC design approval in an SMR field that includes peers such as TerraPower and GE Hitachi, which supports its position when pitching long term baseload power to utilities and data center customers.</li> <li>🎁 The Romanian SMR investment decision and work with the Tennessee Valley Authority show that there is institutional interest in NuScale’s technology for future nuclear capacity.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, any updates on the ENTRA1 related lawsuits, including motions to dismiss, settlements or regulatory follow up, because these will shape potential financial and disclosure consequences. Second, NuScale’s cash burn, use of the US$1b equity program and any changes in project timing in future results, as the company reported a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million. Third, progress on concrete delivery milestones at the Romanian plant and with the TVA partnership compared with other SMR efforts from players such as Rolls Royce and GE Hitachi. Together, those signals will indicate whether NuScale can keep moving from engineering work to funded projects while managing legal and financing pressures.</p> <p>To stay up to date on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NuScale Power, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/SMR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for NuScale Power</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This update reinforces that tension but does not fundamentally change it.</p> <p>The most relevant recent development is management’s progress on securing AI data center leases tied to its Texas power footprint, highlighted again with this quarter’s results. This matters because it links existing mining infrastructure and power access to a potential new revenue stream in AI and HPC, directly related to the current investor focus.

The implied long run dividend growth rate is capped at 1.73%, even though the underlying input growth estimate is 3.39%. That cap is intended to keep the assumptions conservative and aligned with what may be sustainable over time.</p> <p>Using these inputs, the DDM outputs an intrinsic value of roughly €18.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of €19.77, this implies the stock screens as about 7.2% overvalued on this model. This is a relatively small gap and is well within the range where interest rate or dividend assumptions can easily shift the result.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>E.ON is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dividend Discount Model (DDM)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you see how many euros the market is willing to pay for each euro of annual profit.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company's growth outlook and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to line up with a lower P/E.</p> <p>E.ON is currently trading on a P/E of 17.21x. That is below the Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.20x but above the peer group average of 16.26x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for E.ON is 7.16x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable given factors like the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio directly incorporates those company specific drivers, it offers a more tailored yardstick than simple peer or industry comparisons. The current P/E of 17.21x is well above the Fair Ratio of 7.16x, which indicates that the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about E.ON, linked directly to a forecast for its revenue, earnings and margins, and then to your own view of fair value. All of this is captured in an easy tool on Simply Wall St's Community page that compares your fair value to the live share price, updates automatically when fresh news or earnings arrive, and lets different investors express very different views. For example, one Narrative might lean toward the higher analyst fair value of about €18.30 with stronger long term assumptions, while another might sit closer to the lower analyst price target of €14.00 with more cautious expectations. This gives you a clear, numbers based way to decide whether the current price near €19.77 lines up with the story you believe.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for E.ON? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/EOAN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/de/utilities/etr-eoan/eon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/65b45e58-8429-40c5-8cbc-0e551fb3f29b/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XTRA:EOAN 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Constellation Software and its subsidiary Topicus.com recently reported that Topicus.com’s fourth-quarter 2025 revenue rose 20% year over year, with 4% organic growth and the remainder driven by acquisitions, alongside a 41% increase in quarterly net income but a lower full-year net income due to an accounting expense tied to its investment in Asseco Poland S.A.</li> <li>These results underline how Topicus.com’s acquisition-led expansion and sizeable investment in Asseco Poland S.A. are becoming increasingly important to Constellation Software’s overall business profile.</li> <li>We’ll now explore how Topicus.com’s acquisition-fueled growth and earnings performance may influence Constellation Software’s investment narrative for shareholders.</li> </ul><p>Outshine the giants: these <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434414/ai-penny-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 early-stage AI stocks could fund your retirement</a>.</p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>What Is Constellation Software's Investment Narrative?</h2><p>To own Constellation Software, you really have to believe in its ability to keep buying and improving vertical market software businesses, then compound the cash they throw off with disciplined capital allocation. The latest Topicus.com update, with acquisition-driven revenue growth and a jump in quarterly earnings but a hit to full-year profit from the Asseco Poland S.A. accounting charge, reinforces that Constellation’s story is increasingly tied to complex deal-making rather than smooth headline numbers. In the short term, that likely sharpens the focus on the upcoming Q4 2025 results as a catalyst, particularly around how management explains one-off items and the returns they expect from large equity stakes. It also nudges the risk profile a bit higher around balance sheet flexibility, integration execution and earnings volatility, even if the market reaction so far suggests no dramatic change to the core thesis.</p> However, one key balance sheet risk linked to acquisition intensity is easy to overlook and investors should be aware of it.\n\nConstellation Software's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-csu/constellation-software-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c7251dc1-43e4-4b4d-943d-ec40ff5f4adc/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:CSU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Nineteen Simply Wall St Community members see fair value anywhere between about CA$3,333 and CA$7,927, underscoring how far apart individual views can be.

This suggests recent news is being viewed as a significant shift in growth prospects and risk profile rather than a short term move.</p> <p>If this AI server and cooling story has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to look across the wider theme through our screen of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential contenders in the same structural trend.</p> <p>With the shares up sharply and trading slightly above the latest analyst price target, yet showing a large intrinsic discount on some models, the key question is whether 2CRSI is still mispriced or if the market is already pricing in years of growth.</p> <h2>Price to sales premium versus fair value and peers</h2> <p>On the numbers provided, 2CRSI looks inexpensive against the SWS DCF estimate yet expensive on its preferred multiple, which is the P/S ratio. The share last closed at €27.70, while the SWS DCF model estimates a future cash flow value of €53.34, and the shares are described as trading 48.1% below that fair value.</p> <p>The SWS DCF model works by projecting future cash flows for the business and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. That approach tries to capture the specific earnings profile of 2CRSI, including factors such as forecast revenue and profit growth, rather than just comparing it to other tech names using a simple market multiple.</p> <p>Set against that, the preferred multiple being used here is the P/S ratio, which currently sits at 2.8x for 2CRSI. This is described as expensive compared to an estimated fair P/S ratio of 0.6x, and also expensive against the European tech industry average P/S of 0.7x, even though it is below a selected peer group average P/S of 4.3x. That mix of signals shows the market is already paying more per euro of sales than broad sector and regression based benchmarks, while still assigning a lower tag than some direct peers.</p> <p>Put simply, the P/S of 2.8x stands well above both the 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average. That represents strong relative pricing that investors will want to weigh against the large DCF gap. If the market ever moves closer to the SWS fair P/S level suggested by the regression work, that would imply a very different share price than today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for 2CRSI</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-sales of 2.8x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also need to factor in execution risks around turning €220.857m of revenue into stronger profitability, as well as the recent rapid share price swings.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this 2CRSI narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on what the price implies</h2> <p>While the P/S of 2.8x looks rich against a 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average, the SWS DCF model points the other way, with a fair value of €53.34 versus the current €27.70, described as 48.1% below fair value.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are looking at OceanFirst Financial and wondering whether its current share price lines up with its underlying worth, you are asking the exact question this article is built to tackle.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$19.04, with returns of 3.8% over the past 30 days, 6.7% year to date, and 12.8% over the past year. The 3 year and 5 year returns sit at a 5.6% decline and a 5.0% gain respectively.</li> <li>These share price moves sit against a backdrop of ongoing sector wide attention on US regional banks, with investors watching how balance sheets and funding profiles hold up compared to peers. Recent coverage has focused on how smaller banks are positioned within the broader financial sector. This helps frame how a bank like OceanFirst Financial might be assessed by the market.</li> <li>On our checks, OceanFirst Financial has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>.

It focuses on what the bank earns on its equity relative to its cost of equity.</p> <p>For OceanFirst Financial, the model uses a Book Value of US$28.97 per share and a Stable EPS of US$1.62 per share, based on the median return on equity from the past 5 years. The Average Return on Equity is 6.26%, compared with a Cost of Equity of US$2.18 per share. This setup leads to an Excess Return of US$0.56 per share and a Stable Book Value of US$25.85 per share, which is based on weighted future book value estimates from three analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$14.69 per share. Against the recent share price of US$19.04, this implies the stock is around 29.6% overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests OceanFirst Financial may be overvalued by 29.6%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for OceanFirst Financial.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: OceanFirst Financial Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable bank like OceanFirst Financial, the P/E ratio is a practical way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger earnings growth or see lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more muted or risks feel higher.</p> <p>OceanFirst Financial currently trades on a P/E of 16.28x. That sits above the Banks industry average P/E of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.76x, so the market is currently paying a higher price for its earnings than these broad reference points suggest.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might make sense for OceanFirst Financial specifically, given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is 26.69x, which is materially higher than the current 16.28x. On this view, the shares appear undervalued relative to what the model suggests could be a more company specific P/E level.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St these Narratives live on the Community page, where millions of investors can set a fair value and compare it with the current price to help frame buy or sell decisions. They can then see that view update automatically as new news or earnings come in. For OceanFirst Financial, one investor might build a Narrative around the higher US$22.75 price target with stronger revenue and margin assumptions, while another anchors on the US$18.50 target with more conservative expectations, and both can see in real time how their story, numbers and fair value stay aligned with the latest information.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OceanFirst Financial? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/OCFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

For a tanker owner with $294.82m of revenue and earnings that include large one off items, this kind of sales multiple can reflect expectations that current conditions in shipping will support stronger profitability than recent reported margins suggest.</p> <p>Against peers, the gap is clear. The company trades at a 3.9x P/S ratio, while the US Oil and Gas industry average is 1.7x. In other words, the stock is priced at more than double that reference point. Our fair P/S ratio estimate is 0.7x, implying a level the market could move toward if expectations for Nordic American Tankers were to line up with that fair ratio framework.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nordic American Tankers</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 3.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh risks such as revenue falling 4.9% year on year and the current P/S multiple resetting if shipping conditions or earnings prove less supportive.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nordic American Tankers narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Points to a Very Different Price</h2> <p>Our DCF model paints a sharper contrast.

The Supreme Court tariff ruling, and the prospect of refund relief, could modestly ease one of Goodyear’s biggest current pressures: elevated tariff and import costs. However, the key near term catalyst still rests on execution of cost reductions, while the main risk remains weak, volatile replacement and commercial tire demand.</p> <p>In that context, Goodyear’s recent Q4 2025 results are relevant: full year 2025 sales were US$18,280 million with a net loss of US$1,721 million, even as Q4 profitability improved. Any tariff refunds or lower net import costs could influence how much of future cash flow can be directed toward the Goodyear Forward restructuring program, manufacturing upgrades, and premium tire initiatives, which many investors see as central to the margin recovery story.</p> <p>Yet behind this potential relief, investors should be aware of how persistent tariff and import cost uncertainty could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (it's free!)</a></p><p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's narrative projects $18.3 billion revenue and $405.2 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber/k4w5gt65-competitive-pressures-and-market-shifts-will-shape-tire-demand-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's forecasts yield a $9.89 fair value</a>, a 17% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/69a7a862-2f07-48af-8a61-58d950ec00f0/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>GT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the most optimistic analysts were expecting revenue around US$19.4 billion and earnings near US$403 million by 2028, yet the recent tariff shake up could either reinforce their view of tariff driven localization benefits or highlight the contrasting risk that persistently high trade costs and supply chain friction might keep Goodyear’s margins far below those upbeat expectations.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-gt/goodyear-tire-rubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber</a> - why the stock might be worth 10% less than the current price!</p><h2>Decide For Yourself</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?
