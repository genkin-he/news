The recent progress update showing 63% completion and on-budget construction is a big step, as it keeps key short-term catalysts, like first gold production in January 2026 and successful plant commissioning, firmly in play. This milestone reduces uncertainty around delays and cost overruns, which had been front-of-mind risks. However, significant insider selling and a price-to-book ratio well above sector averages leave open questions about valuation and management confidence. While the strong pace of progress likely tempers some immediate risks, funding, gold price sensitivity and execution remain central issues worth tracking as Fenix moves closer to production.</p> Yet, the pace of insider selling raises questions investors should not overlook.\n\nRio2's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-rio/rio2-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d60db42f-7272-451b-a708-599b0564ba25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:RIO Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Nine members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate Rio2's fair value from US$1,000 to US$10,000.

After a sharp 90-day share price return of 10.45% and a strong year-to-date climb of 42.66%, momentum has cooled lately. This is evident in the 1-month share price drop of 8.06%. However, taking a longer view, the 1-year total shareholder return is down 8.76%, and losses deepen over three and five years.

While limited new apartment supply and strong demand trends help stabilize revenue, Essex’s heavy reliance on California and Seattle assets means growth will remain exposed to local regulation and potential economic downturns.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts note ongoing demographic support for occupancy and rents; however, recent slow rent growth in Southern California—which accounts for 40% of Essex’s portfolio—signals risks to sustained profitability.</li> <li>It is notable that, despite the current high margin, analysts anticipate further pressure as Essex phases out higher-yielding investments and encounters more competition along with stricter regulation in its key urban markets.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To see how analysts weigh both upside and risk as margins adjust, check the balanced narrative in full. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Essex Property Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Trails Broader Market</h2> <ul> <li>Revenue is projected to grow at just 2.9% annually over the next three years, well below the expected 10.3% per year for the US market. Earnings are forecast to decline by -22.4% per year during the same period.</li> <li>The consensus narrative underscores that, although Essex’s strategy favors capital allocation to stabilized, high-occupancy apartments in tech-centric areas, the lack of diversification continues to be a risk—recent underperformance in key geographies demonstrates this vulnerability.\n    <ul> <li>Some analysts argue that ongoing softness in Los Angeles and increased exposure to local supply and demand cycles will limit potential growth, particularly as Essex shifts away from higher-margin structured finance and refocuses on core real estate assets.</li> <li>From a consensus perspective, compressed cap rates and strong competition for acquisitions in Northern California, where yields are in the low-to-mid 4% range, could constrain future returns relative to more diversified REIT peers.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Remains Supportive Despite Softer Projections</h2> <ul> <li>Essex’s Price-to-Earnings ratio of 19x is notably below the peer average of 50.8x and the North American Residential REITs industry average of 24.4x. The current share price of $249.82 is about 28% below the DCF fair value estimate of $347.22.</li> <li>The analysts’ consensus narrative acknowledges that while earnings are expected to decline and future profit margins are set to compress, valuation metrics and a current price about 16% below their $291.11 price target provide support for a positive longer-term case for income and value-focused investors.\n    <ul> <li>The ongoing discount to fair value offers a cushion for investors focused on yield and capital protection, while also recognizing potential regulatory and economic volatility.</li> <li>Consensus further highlights that income-oriented investors remain attracted to Essex’s dividend and track record, despite concerns about near-term earnings declines and compressed margins compared to industry averages.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cylwlpml-falling-west-coast-supply-will-drive-demand-despite-mixed-sector-sentiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Essex Property Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you interpret the data another way?

This approach helps investors understand what the business is worth based on its ability to generate cash over time.</p> <p>For Conagra Brands, the DCF model starts with a current Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $1.17 Billion. Analyst estimates project annual FCF growth over the next several years, with forecasts reaching $1.29 Billion by 2029. While analyst predictions are provided for the first five years, projections beyond that period are extrapolated by Simply Wall St to give a full ten-year outlook on future cash generation.</p> <p>After discounting these future cash flows to reflect their value in today's terms, the estimated intrinsic value for Conagra Brands stock stands at $76.38 per share. This calculation suggests the market is pricing the company at a steep discount. According to the DCF model, the stock is currently trading 77.2% below its fair value.</p> <p>Given these projections, the DCF model indicates that Conagra Brands may be significantly undervalued compared to its estimated future earnings power.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Conagra Brands is undervalued by 77.2%.

It's especially useful when a company generates steady profits and you want a quick sense of how it stacks up to similar businesses.</p> <p>What counts as a fair PE ratio can depend on several factors. Higher growth prospects usually justify a higher multiple, while greater risks or slower expected growth push that “normal” multiple lower. Comparing a company’s PE to its sector and direct peers can give you perspective, but it does not tell the full story about its unique outlook and characteristics.</p> <p>Currently, Conagra Brands trades at a PE ratio of 9.8x. For context, the average PE ratio among its food industry peers is 15.5x, and the wider industry average stands at 17.9x. At first glance, this price looks attractively low. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio, which factors in growth, profit margin, risk profile, and market cap, suggests a fair value PE ratio for Conagra of 17.0x. Unlike basic comparisons, this Fair Ratio provides a more accurate picture by tailoring the benchmark to the company’s specific circumstances.</p> <p>In simple terms, Conagra’s current PE is well below both its peer group and its Fair Ratio, indicating the stock is undervalued based on its earnings potential and fundamental outlook.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-cag/conagra-brands/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CAG PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/04039ab2-17ae-4d3e-9bdc-01df3f150b8c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CAG PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1408 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Conagra Brands Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your personal story or perspective about a company that connects the dots between the business’s strategy, future financial forecasts, and what you believe its shares should be worth.</p> <p>Unlike traditional valuation tools, Narratives empower investors to make sense of the numbers by tying them to real-world trends, assumptions about revenue, margins, and risk, and your expectations for the company’s future. Each Narrative links your view of Conagra Brands’ path ahead to an explicit financial forecast, culminating in a calculated fair value tailored to your outlook.</p> <p>Narratives are easy to use and fully accessible via Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share, compare, and refine their investment stories. They provide actionable confidence by letting you see at a glance if the market price is below or above your own fair value, helping you decide when a stock is truly a buy or a sell in your playbook.</p> <p>As news breaks or earnings are released, Narratives update dynamically, so your story and valuation always reflect the latest facts. For example, one investor might believe that Conagra’s strong brands and improved supply chain will drive stable margins and assign a fair value near $26 per share, while another could focus on industry headwinds and see fair value closer to $18. Both are valid stories with real numbers behind them.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Conagra Brands? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-cag/conagra-brands/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CAG Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/04039ab2-17ae-4d3e-9bdc-01df3f150b8c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CAG Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.

By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Redeia Corporación (BME:RED) is forecasting earnings growth of 5.23% per year and expects revenue to rise 4.8% annually, which is ahead of the broader Spanish market's 4.2% growth outlook. Despite these positive projections, the company's net profit margin has slipped from 33.6% to 30%, and reported earnings have decreased at a rate of 5.5% per year over the last five years. Although the stock is trading at a premium, with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 16.6x that surpasses both its peers (14.9x) and the industry average (13.3x), the current share price of €15.61 also remains above the estimated fair value of €13.75.

These factors help counter the recent drop in net profit margin.</li> <li>New regulatory incentives and higher projected EBITDA indicate that long-term investments could help stabilize or lift profitability, even as capital expenditure ramps up.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rising Capital Investment, Rising Risks</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia plans average annual capital expenditures of at least €1.5 billion through 2028, well above previous levels and industry norms, with major projects reinforcing the Spanish power network and interconnections.</li> <li> The consensus narrative notes that these heavy investments grow the regulated asset base and strengthen future revenue streams, yet bring notable risk:\n    <ul> <li>Operational and financial stress is cited as a risk. Ambitious spending could overload balance sheet leverage and pressure free cash flow if subsidies or disposals do not materialize as planned.</li> <li>S&amp;P's placement of Redeia on negative CreditWatch underscores the concern that costly upgrades and regulatory uncertainty may elevate credit risk and funding costs over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Stays Stretched Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia's current share price (€15.61) sits well above the DCF fair value estimate of €13.75 and implies a PE ratio of 16.6x, higher than both its peer group (14.9x) and the European Electric Utilities sector (13.3x).</li> <li> Analysts’ consensus view underscores the persistent premium. To match the long-term analyst price target of €17.86, investors must believe in sustained robust growth and margin recovery.\n    <ul> <li>The requirement for Redeia to trade at 19.5x PE on 2028 earnings shows the valuation is already baking in meaningful upside. This may leave little margin for error if growth or regulation disappoints.</li> <li>This premium reflects optimism about investment-led gains but creates valuation sensitivity if margin improvements or capital returns lag expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Analyst forecasts and fundamental trends show Redeia's profile is defined by the balancing act between ambitious, capex-driven growth and the risks of cost overruns, margin pressure, and valuation stretch.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Redeia Corporación Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Redeia Corporación on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Want to interpret the data through your own lens?

This creates a runway for double-digit sales increases in fast growth end markets and supports sustained above-GDP revenue growth.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Kirby (NYSE:KEX) posted a net profit margin of 9.2% for the latest period, slightly down from last year's 9.4%. The company saw its earnings contract over the past twelve months, reversing a strong five-year track record of 56.7% annualized earnings growth. Kirby is now expected to grow earnings at 7.4% per year going forward, trailing the broader US market's 15.7% pace. Despite solid historical profitability and high-quality earnings, forward-looking growth rates and recent compression in net margins, paired with a premium valuation, give investors plenty to consider this earnings season.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Kirby.</a> <p>The next section puts Kirby's results head-to-head with the popular market narratives to reveal where expectations line up and where investor assumptions might face new challenges.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Kirby</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-kex/kirby/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/35154fdf-b7c7-4a38-b012-29fc4c0387af/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:KEX Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Analyst Price Target Offers 15.6% Upside to Current Price</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby's share price sits at $104.33, notably below the analyst price target of $120.60, representing potential upside of about 15.6% from current levels if analyst forecasts play out.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights that for shares to reach the $120.60 target, Kirby must achieve projected revenue growth averaging 6.1% per year and expand profit margins from 9.3% to 11.4% by 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This scenario assumes earnings climb to $445.6 million over the next four years, matching analysts' expectations for consistent multi-year growth and market share gains.</li> <li>To justify the price target, Kirby would need to trade at a forward PE of 16.5x in 2028, which is nearly double the industry average of 8.4x. This suggests ongoing investor confidence in its premium positioning and strategic tailwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Consensus narrative says Kirby’s numbers have to keep stacking up. See why Wall Street is watching the margin and revenue run rates so closely. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Kirby Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2>Premium Valuation Compared to Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19.1x, substantially higher than the US shipping industry average of 7.1x and its peer group at 7.9x, making it one of the priciest stocks in its sector on this basis.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that this valuation premium is driven by Kirby’s consistent profit expansion over five years, its strong balance sheet, and the expectation of further industry consolidation.\n    <ul> <li>However, the gap suggests investors are banking on Kirby maintaining or outperforming its current growth trajectory, leaving little room for operational missteps relative to lower-multiple rivals.</li> <li>Analysts also flag that future PE multiples remain ambitious. Even if Kirby meets earnings targets, its shares need to hold above today’s sector-wide valuation to fulfill upward price expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Industry Tailwinds vs. Market Growth Rates</h2> <ul> <li>Kirby’s revenue is forecast to grow at 4.8% per year, which lags significantly behind the broader US market’s expected 10.3% annual revenue growth. This is a sign its end-markets remain solid but are not keeping pace with wider economic sectors.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that limited vessel supply, data center investment, and U.S. manufacturing reshoring may help Kirby maintain steady utilization and revenue visibility despite softer chemical demand.\n    <ul> <li>Offsetting these strengths, the consensus view cautions that Kirby’s dependence on the petrochemical market, ongoing cost pressures, and limited international diversification could constrain top-line expansion and earnings stability if the US economic cycle weakens.</li> <li>This tension means that even with powerful industry trends at its back, Kirby’s outlook is inevitably tied to the health of cyclical chemical demand and capital expenditures by US industry.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f9aipo2x-inland-barge-utilization-will-remain-resilient-despite-near-term-rate-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Kirby on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Think you have a unique perspective on Kirby’s results?
