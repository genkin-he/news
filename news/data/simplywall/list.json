            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making.  But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.  A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Quickly Is Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Increasing Earnings Per Share? </h2><p> The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually.  That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings. This leaves little for bulls to point to as an upside driver at this time.</li> <li>Bears highlight the absence of growth catalysts and the company’s inability to demonstrate sustained profitability.\n    <ul> <li>Unlike some industry peers showing clear revenue growth or forecast visibility, SEACOR Marine’s filings suggest that both top-line and bottom-line momentum are lacking.</li> <li>This ongoing growth gap underlines the bearish view that the company’s current trajectory fails to convince markets of any near-term turnaround, intensified by the lack of reward factors in the data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Financial Position Limits Upside Potential</h2> <ul> <li>SEACOR Marine is not regarded as being in a strong financial position, with continued unprofitability and no evidence of improved profitability over the last year. This makes it especially vulnerable to sector swings.</li> <li>Bears argue that risks around financial stability will persist unless the company can show tangible steps towards breaking the loss trend.\n    <ul> <li>With revenue and earnings not expected to grow, the justification for an improved valuation or sustained share price remains weak compared to steady or recovering peers.</li> <li>The company’s discounted P/S ratio, while partially reflecting sector caution, increases investor sensitivity to any setback in operational performance or industry outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>SK hynix</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ₩32t ÷ (₩129t - ₩25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Investors in <strong>Jindal Steel Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:JINDALSTEL</a>) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.1% to close at ₹1,070 following the release of its second-quarter results.       It was a workmanlike result, with revenues of ₹117b coming in 4.9% ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share of ₹27.83, in line with analyst appraisals.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If met, it would imply a notable 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 110% to ₹56.56.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ₹566.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹61.65 in 2026.        So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Jindal Steel </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target held steady at ₹1,093, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.        Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation.  There are some variant perceptions on Jindal Steel, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at ₹1,400 and the most bearish at ₹600 per share.   Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/materials/metals-mining\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's clear from the latest estimates that Jindal Steel's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 30% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.6% p.a. over the past five years.    Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 11% annually.  Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Jindal Steel is expected to grow much faster than its industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results.        Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   We have estimates - from multiple Jindal Steel analysts - going out to 2028, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> You should always think about risks though.

The recent volatility in precious metal pricing has affected sentiment across the sector, but it has not materially altered Wheaton's biggest short-term catalyst: expanding production from Salobo III and Blackwater. At the same time, the largest risk remains the future availability of attractive, high-margin streaming deals to support long-term revenue expansion.\n</p> <p> Among recent company announcements, Wheaton’s reaffirmed production guidance for 2025 stands out. This is relevant as it underpins the current growth narrative, linking directly to new output from Salobo III and Blackwater.

If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is PDS's Net Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2025 PDS had debt of ₹11.0b, up from ₹9.76b in one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of ₹10.5b, its net debt is less, at about ₹530.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/225670672-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761871252616\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PDSL Debt to Equity History October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is PDS' Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, PDS had liabilities of ₹29.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of ₹2.44b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of ₹10.5b and ₹14.2b worth of receivables due within a year.   So it has liabilities totalling ₹6.87b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, PDS has a  market capitalization of ₹52.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.    Carrying virtually no net debt, PDS has a very light debt load indeed.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for PDS </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> PDS has a very low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.15 so it is strange to see weak interest coverage, with last year's EBIT being only 2.4 times the interest expense.  So while we're not necessarily alarmed we think that its debt is far from trivial.        Unfortunately, PDS's EBIT flopped 13% over the last four quarters.  If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine PDS's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, PDS produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for PDS was the fact that it seems able handle its debt, based on its EBITDA, confidently.  However, our other observations weren't so heartening.   In particular, interest cover gives us cold feet.       When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about PDS's use of debt.  While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Canadian Phosphate insiders own 27% of the company, worth about AU$4.9m.  This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Canadian Phosphate Tell Us? </h2><p> Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months.  The net investment is not enough to encourage us much.     However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Insiders own shares in Canadian Phosphate and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Canadian Phosphate.

Despite the recent uptick in production and turnover, the one-year total shareholder return stands at -13.25%, and long-term holders have experienced deeper declines.

The recent shipment of B1 QSE-5 samples, featuring the Cobra separator process, marks a concrete milestone and feeds optimism around near-term catalysts like automotive partnerships and real-world testing. For shareholders, the path forward is still shaped by critical questions: Can QuantumScape translate technical advances into scaled production and repeat customer billings? While the first-ever revenue of US$12.8 million and reduced losses are positive, the stock’s volatility and high price-to-book ratio show that market confidence is still very sensitive to incremental progress. With management highlighting cash runway into 2029, the operational risks now center on production ramp-up and achieving automotive-grade reliability, areas directly influenced by these recent developments. If the Eagle Line pilot and ongoing collaborations deliver, the balance of risk and reward may begin to shift, but uncertainty about when significant revenues will follow remains front and center for most investors.\n<br/> Yet with all this momentum, the risk around scaling to full automotive-grade reliability still looms large.\n</p> QuantumScape's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/be3f5016-19bf-4bc6-b5ac-31a802792b25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirty-two members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate fair value from US$3.78 to US$37.80 per share, illustrating a broad spectrum of investor views.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>SpareBank 1 SMN (OB:MING) posted robust results for the period, with net profit margins edging up to 34.4% from 33.5% a year ago. Over the past five years, earnings have grown at a healthy 19.8% per year, though most recent annual earnings growth eased to 3.9%. Investors will find it notable that the shares are priced attractively, with a PE ratio of 8.6x, which is well below both the sector average and the company is trading under its estimated fair value at NOK 188.76. Looking ahead, forecasts point to earnings growth of 6.7% per year and revenue growth of 0.7% per year. Both figures trail the broader Norwegian market, but the company’s reputation for high-quality, consistent profits keeps sentiment positive.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/banks/ob-ming/sparebank-1-smn-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for SpareBank 1 SMN.</a> <p>The next section sets these results against the widely held narratives for SpareBank 1 SMN and highlights where the numbers support market sentiment and where the story could shift.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?
