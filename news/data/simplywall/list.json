The latest results, with a 2025 net loss of US$206.4 million alongside record free cash flow and 2026 revenue guidance of US$2.70 billion to US$2.80 billion, do not remove the key short term catalyst of D2C execution or the main risk around profitability and reliance on mature games.</p> <p>The refinancing of Playtika’s US$550 million revolving credit facility, extending liquidity out to 2027 on largely unchanged terms, is particularly relevant here. It supports the company’s ability to keep investing in D2C growth, casual titles like Disney Solitaire, and ongoing buybacks, even after suspending the dividend, which could matter for how quickly any improvement in margins or revenue mix feeds through to shareholder value.</p> <p>Yet, despite this progress, investors should be aware that high marketing spend and licensing costs could still pressure margins if...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nasdaq-pltk/playtika-holding/x2ciuc4p-pltk-rising-profit-margins-will-drive-renewed-market-optimism-going-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Playtika Holding (it's free!)</a></p><p>Playtika Holding's narrative projects $3.0 billion revenue and $249.2 million earnings by 2028.

The latest half-year update, with record output and A$96.3 million in net income, reinforces that story by showing Sand King is not just online, but already repaid and throwing off cash. That materially strengthens the near-term funding case for the proposed ~3 mtpa mill and Waihi open pit restart, and may ease concerns about overreliance on the new debt facility. At the same time, the sharp share price pullback over the past month suggests the market is still focused on execution risk, especially around sustaining margins and converting today’s strong free cash flow into durable returns if gold prices soften.</p> However, one risk around sustaining current margins and cash flows deserves closer attention. \nOra Banda Mining's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-obm/ora-banda-mining-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/10ee5398-4b96-4b2c-b0ad-b48a665e44bf/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:OBM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Eleven fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span A$1.11 to about A$4.36 per share, showing wide disagreement on what Ora Banda is worth.

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>For you as an investor, this CEO change sits on top of several moving pieces for Kroger. Greg Foran brings large scale grocery and general merchandise experience from Walmart, which could be relevant as Kroger tightens its cost base, simplifies its structure, and closes underperforming locations. Those are sensitive moves in a low margin business where peers like Walmart, Costco, and Target are also pushing hard on price, private label, and e-commerce. At the same time, Kroger is investing in health focused offerings such as GLP-1 support programs and dietitian services, and continues to face mixed analyst views, including a recent downgrade to Equal Weight and lowered price target. The combination of leadership overhaul, restructuring and varied external opinions means execution and communication from the new CEO may matter more to how you interpret short and medium term developments.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kroger Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Foran’s appointment could support the existing narrative around tighter cost controls, automation, and store footprint review, as he has experience managing large store networks and operational efficiency at scale.</li> <li>Restructuring, store closures, and a leadership change after a board investigation may challenge earlier assumptions that cost optimization and store expansion would progress smoothly without governance or cultural friction.</li> <li>The increased focus on GLP-1 medication programs and broader wellness offerings is only partly reflected in the existing narrative and may add another dimension to Kroger’s health focused positioning over time.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/blqx7z7z-e-commerce-expansion-and-health-focus-will-strengthen-future-szdj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kroger</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Leadership turnover following a board investigation introduces uncertainty around culture, retention, and the pace of operational changes.</li> <li>⚠️ Store closures, restructuring, and heavy investment in digital and supply chain projects could pressure margins and free cash flow if benefits take longer than expected.</li> <li>🎁 Foran’s large format retail and grocery background may help align store portfolio, pricing, and operations with what has worked at other scale retailers.</li> <li>🎁 Kroger’s push into health and wellness services, including GLP-1 support, provides an additional way to differentiate versus competitors while using existing pharmacy and food infrastructure.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how quickly the new CEO sets out a clear plan for Kroger’s store footprint, cost base, and digital priorities, and whether that plan stays consistent through the upcoming earnings cycle.

The latest US$775.67 million equity raise via a forward sale slots directly into that story: it helps fund the planned US$38.00 billion of grid and clean‑energy infrastructure spending while also easing pressure on an already leveraged balance sheet. In the near term, that likely means the key catalysts remain regulatory decisions, execution on capital projects and continued dividend progression, while the main trade‑off is incremental dilution for existing shareholders. With the shares recently trading a little above consensus fair value and analysts broadly neutral, the offering itself does not look like a thesis‑changing event, but it does sharpen focus on funding costs, outage performance and future rate outcomes.</p> However, investors should be aware of how repeated equity raises could affect long term returns.\n\nConsolidated Edison's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/721aa817-6bdd-4ca3-aa2e-3117a6b10b23/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates cluster tightly around US$105 to US$108, hinting at limited perceived mispricing.

The latest quarter showed softer earnings despite higher full year revenue, while management kept returning capital through dividends and buybacks. In the near term, the key catalyst remains execution in fixed operations and EchoPark, with the biggest risk being pressure on margins if vehicle demand or pricing weakens further. The recent results do not appear to change that balance in a material way.</p> <p>The most relevant update here is Sonic’s continued share repurchases, with 600,000 shares bought back in the fourth quarter of 2025 for US$38.3 million, bringing total repurchases under the long running 2004 authorization to about US$1.16 billion. Set against lower full year 2025 net income and margins, this capital return sits alongside the US$0.38 per share dividend and frames how management is currently balancing near term earnings softness with shareholder distributions.</p> <p>Yet while capital returns may look reassuring, investors should be aware that rising new car prices and potential demand pressure in 2026 could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/retail/nyse-sah/sonic-automotive/djy1xoyy-us-auto-trends-will-fuel-expansion-in-fixed-operations-yw4n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Sonic Automotive (it's free!)</a></p><p>Sonic Automotive's narrative projects $17.5 billion revenue and $310.7 million earnings by 2028.

This lines up with worries about earnings sensitivity when growth slows.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue stayed close to US$2.5b. The drop from a 6.9% to 4.2% net margin is therefore more about profitability than demand collapsing, which is exactly the pressure point bears focus on rather than a volume shock.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Globant's thinner 4.2% net margin and that Q2 loss are exactly the kind of numbers bears point to when they argue the business model is under pressure. It is worth seeing how that squares with a full Bear Case view in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/uppr7toe-ai-and-geopolitical-risks-will-limit-demand-yet-offer-hope-havg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Globant Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>One Off US$73.3m Loss Clouds Earnings Trend</h2> <ul> <li>The last 12 months included a one off loss of US$73.3 million, which weighed on the reported net income of US$102.9 million and on the 4.2% net margin figure investors are looking at today.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this large item masks the underlying earnings power, and the data gives them some talking points:\n    <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, three of the four quarters were profitable on a net income excluding extra items basis, adding up to US$102.9 million despite the drag from the one off. Bulls see this as more reflective of the ongoing run rate than the headline margin alone.</li> <li>Analysts in the bullish camp also point to forecast earnings growth of about 21.6% per year from this base, so they treat the US$73.3 million charge as a temporary hit rather than a permanent change in the business model that would keep margins at 4.2%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see that US$73.3 million one off charge as a speed bump rather than a reset of long term profitability, which is a key pillar of the Bull Case set out in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1hiaw3fa-ai-and-cloud-native-solutions-will-transform-global-work-models-zxut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Globant Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E Of 21.3x And DCF Fair Value Gap</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$49.76, Globant trades on a P/E of 21.3x, slightly above the 18.2x peer average and roughly in line with the US IT industry at 21x, while the supplied DCF fair value of US$101.78 sits well above the current price.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about a mixed risk and reward setup, and the current numbers show why views are split:\n    <ul> <li>On one side, the DCF fair value of US$101.78 implies a large gap to the share price. This lines up with the idea that the market may be underpricing the 21.6% forecast earnings growth even though revenue is only expected to grow about 4.7% per year.</li> <li>On the other, the higher than peer P/E together with a trailing net margin of 4.2% means today’s valuation is being asked to sit on top of relatively modest profitability. This is exactly what more cautious investors focus on when they question how much of that growth is already reflected in the multiple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Globant on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious signals leaves you on the fence, act while the data is fresh and weigh it against your own expectations, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Globant’s thinner 4.2% net margin, a recent quarterly loss and a one off US$73.3 million charge all raise questions about the consistency of its earnings power.</p> <p>If you are uneasy about paying up for that kind of earnings volatility, it is worth checking our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">76 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> to focus on companies with more stable profiles right now.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This kind of coverage helps explain why some investors are paying close attention to the stock after its recent performance and are starting to reassess what they think the shares are worth.</li> <li>On our checklist of six valuation tests, Teledyne scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a> for being undervalued, which sets up a closer look at how different models assess its worth and, later in the article, an even more practical way to judge whether the current price makes sense for you.</li> </ul> <p>Teledyne Technologies scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks.

The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $1.08b. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations suggest free cash flow reaching around $1.92b in 2035, with interim projections such as $1.17b in 2026 and $1.39b in 2028. These figures are all expressed in US$ and include both analyst inputs and Simply Wall St extrapolations beyond the typical five year analyst window.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $577 per share, compared with a current share price of roughly $681. That implies the stock is about 18.0% above this particular fair value estimate, based on this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Teledyne Technologies may be overvalued by 18.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 47 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Teledyne Technologies.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Teledyne Technologies Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Teledyne Technologies, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for the stock to the earnings the business is currently generating. In general, higher growth expectations or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower, more conservative multiple.</p> <p>Teledyne’s current P/E is about 35.25x, compared with the Electronic industry average of around 27.59x and a peer average of roughly 60.93x. To give a more tailored view, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 24.68x for Teledyne, which is the P/E level it might trade on given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more useful than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it is specific to Teledyne’s own mix of growth, risks and profitability. Relative to that Fair Ratio of 24.68x, the current P/E of 35.25x is higher by a clear margin, suggesting the shares are pricing in richer terms than this model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$5.33 in Q2 2024 to losses of US$1.28, US$0.14 and US$1.01 across 2025, setting up a story where investors are likely to focus on how efficiently MBIA is managing its shrinking top line against persistent losses and what that implies for margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for MBIA.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to weigh them against the most widely held narratives around MBIA, to see which stories the latest results support and which ones the data starts to challenge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/4it2jeai-update-for-mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about MBIA</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e7562be9-1d4c-489e-b33b-f5446fff2d04/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Running losses still large at US$175 million TTM</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, MBIA reported total revenue of US$80 million and a net loss from ongoing operations of US$175 million, which works out to basic EPS of US$3.55 in losses.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about earnings reaching US$58.3 million by around 2028 with margins moving from about 188.2% in the red to 64.6% in the black, and the current loss profile sets up a clear test of that path:\n    <ul> <li>The last four reported quarters still show losses in each period, including US$50 million in Q4 2025 and US$62 million in Q1 2025, so any future profit story has to bridge that gap.</li> <li>At the same time, the data shows losses shrinking at about 4.2% per year over five years. This is consistent with a gradual improvement but still far from the earnings level implied in those longer term forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue growth vs flat outlook</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, revenue growth is described at about 8.4% per year. Yet quarterly revenue in the table runs from US$33 million in Q3 2024 to US$13 million in Q4 2025, while analysts assume revenue of US$90.4 million by 2028 that is characterized as fairly flat over the next three years.</li> <li>What is interesting for the bullish narrative is how that 8.4% revenue growth rate lines up with assumptions that revenue stays fairly flat, even as bulls expect higher margins to carry future earnings:\n    <ul> <li>The consensus narrative ties a lot of the potential upside to margin improvement rather than big new premium growth. This fits with comments about the insured portfolio running off and limiting future revenue expansion.</li> <li>Given that the insured par at National is described as shrinking and leverage sits at 23 to 1, bulls are effectively leaning on cost control and better outcomes on legacy exposures rather than a jump in top line to support those margin targets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how those margin assumptions stack up against MBIA's latest numbers, have a look at <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MBIA Bull Case</strong></a> for the full bull case.\n\n<h2>Premium P/S, mixed valuation signals</h2> <ul> <li>MBIA trades on a P/S of 4.1x compared with about 1.2x for the wider US insurance group and roughly 1.0x for peers. A DCF fair value of about US$34.47 in the supplied data sits well above the current share price of US$6.55 and the analyst price target of US$7.75.</li> <li>Bears focus on that valuation gap by pointing out that the premium P/S multiple is coming alongside negative shareholders' equity and ongoing losses, which leaves little room for disappointment if forecasts do not play out as expected:\n    <ul> <li>The company is still unprofitable on a trailing 12 month basis and has negative equity flagged in the risk summary, so the balance sheet is not yet reflecting the DCF fair value figure or the US$58.3 million earnings level assumed for 2028.</li> <li>With the analyst price target only about 18% above the current US$6.55 share price, skeptics can argue that the market is already cautious, even as the DCF fair value number suggests a much larger gap that depends heavily on that future profit recovery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical about whether those losses and balance sheet issues justify a premium P/S?

For Iron Mountain, this version of the DCF uses adjusted funds from operations as a proxy for free cash flow to equity.</p> <p>The model starts from Iron Mountain’s last twelve months free cash flow of about $1.54b, then uses analyst estimates for the next few years and extends them out to 2035. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $2.49b, with intermediate annual projections between 2026 and 2035 that are either based on analyst forecasts or extrapolated estimates by Simply Wall St.</p> <p>Discounting this stream of projected cash flows results in an estimated intrinsic value of about $155.76 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$108.33, the model implies the stock trades at a 30.4% discount. On this DCF view, Iron Mountain screens as undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Iron Mountain is undervalued by 30.4%.

It is especially handy when earnings can be affected by non cash items or accounting choices, while sales remain a cleaner top line measure.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/S ratio depends on how quickly investors expect sales to grow and how much risk they see in those expectations. Higher perceived growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty tends to line up with a lower ratio.</p> <p>Iron Mountain currently trades on a P/S ratio of 4.64x. That sits below the Specialized REITs industry average of 7.56x and below the peer group average of 7.32x. Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for Iron Mountain is 5.32x, which estimates the P/S level that fits its earnings profile, industry, profit margin, size and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or industry averages because it folds in those company specific factors. With the current 4.64x P/S sitting below the 5.32x Fair Ratio, Iron Mountain appears undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 19 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Iron Mountain Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company linked directly to the numbers behind its fair value, such as what you think Iron Mountain can earn, how quickly revenue might grow, and what margin range feels reasonable.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and turn that story into a forecast and a fair value estimate, then keep it updated automatically when new data arrives, such as analyst revisions, earnings results or news.</p> <p>That makes it easier for you to compare the Fair Value from your Narrative with Iron Mountain’s current share price and decide whether you view the stock as offering enough potential reward, too little, or something in between.</p> <p>For example, one Iron Mountain Narrative on the platform currently anchors on a fair value of about US$65.53 while another stretches to about US$160.00. This shows how two investors looking at the same business, from legacy storage risk on one side to information infrastructure opportunity on the other, can reach very different yet clearly framed views.</p> <p>For Iron Mountain, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Iron Mountain Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/xn8xw1oo-legacy-data-management-with-optionality-in-digital-and-infrastructure-expansion?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Iron Mountain Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 32.3% below the narrative fair value based on the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: very large, reflecting a multi fold increase from the current base</p> <ul> <li>Frames Iron Mountain as a global information management REIT with deep exposure to regulated sectors like healthcare, financial services and government, where compliance needs and high switching costs support long contracts.</li> <li>Sees the combination of sticky physical storage and expanding digital and data center services as a hybrid model, with legacy assets supplying cash and newer offerings adding optionality and new revenue pillars.</li> <li>Argues that as customers upgrade infrastructure and refine data governance, Iron Mountain’s focus on secure colocation, digital transformation and lifecycle management can support meaningful growth in information infrastructure services.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain/a5ubyqkq-falling-legacy-demand-will-burden-data-center-margins-1jbl?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Iron Mountain Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$65.53</p> <p>Implied downside to this fair value: 38.4% below the recent US$108.33 share price</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 9.19%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights the risk that faster cloud adoption and digital transformation reduce demand for legacy physical storage, while tougher competition and higher costs in data centers pressure margins.</li> <li>Points to ongoing capital needs, sustainability requirements and potential commoditization in data centers as factors that could strain free cash flow, leverage and pricing power over time.</li> <li>Bases its lower fair value on analyst assumptions for mid single digit revenue growth, higher future profit margins and a lower future P/E, arguing that current market expectations may already be demanding.</li> </ul> <p>If seeing both sides laid out like this helps you clarify your own view, the next step is to go straight to the full narratives, compare the assumptions with your expectations for Iron Mountain and decide which story feels closer to how you think the business can perform.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Iron Mountain? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/IRM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irm/iron-mountain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1f278899-edd3-4fb5-aca3-77a01574badb/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:IRM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

It is essentially asking what those future cash flows are worth to you right now.</p> <p>For Telecom Italia, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about €895.2 million. Analysts and internal estimates project free cash flow of €1,710 million by 2030, with intermediate years between 2026 and 2035 ranging roughly from a little over €1,058 million to around €2,234 million, all in €. Simply Wall St uses analyst inputs where available and then extrapolates beyond that horizon.</p> <p>Adding up those discounted cash flows leads to an estimated intrinsic value of about €1.05 per share. Compared with the recent share price of €0.6362, the model suggests the shares trade at a 39.4% discount, which screens as undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Telecom Italia is undervalued by 39.4%.

Revenue tends to be more stable than earnings, which can make P/S a useful cross check on value for companies in this sector.</p> <p>In general, higher expected growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually support a lower multiple. So context really matters when you compare ratios.</p> <p>Telecom Italia currently trades on a P/S of 0.94x, compared with the wider Telecom industry average of 1.50x and a peer group average of 4.53x. Simply Wall St also calculates a Fair Ratio of 2.03x, which is the P/S level it would expect given factors such as Telecom Italia's growth profile, margins, industry, market value and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the industry, because it adjusts for those company characteristics rather than assuming all telecom operators should trade at similar levels. Setting the Fair Ratio of 2.03x against the current 0.94x P/S suggests Telecom Italia's shares screen as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/it/telecom/bit-tit/telecom-italia-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BIT:TIT P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b911ea30-ed47-4799-a9ea-2da48544566b/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BIT:TIT P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The past 3 months show similar pressure on the stock.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-pnr/pentair\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Pentair.</a></p> <p>At around US$99.19, Pentair’s recent share price pressure, including a 5.9% year to date share price decline, sits against a contrasting backdrop of a 6.4% 1 year total shareholder return and an 83.5% 5 year total shareholder return. This suggests shorter term momentum has faded while longer term holders have still seen gains.</p> <p>If Pentair’s recent pullback has you rethinking where growth could come from next, it might be worth scanning opportunities in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> connected to long term infrastructure and electrification themes.</p> <p>With Pentair trading near US$99.19, close to some fair value estimates yet at a discount to analyst targets, you have to ask yourself: is this pullback a fresh entry point, or is the market already accounting for future growth?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 12.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Pentair last closing at about $99.19 against a narrative fair value of $113.68, the widely followed view is that the current price sits below what the underlying cash flows might support, based on detailed revenue and margin forecasts discounted at 9.18%.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Secular shifts toward stricter regulations on water quality and sustainability, alongside rising investments in ESG and resource-efficient water infrastructure, are increasing global demand for Pentair's advanced purification and filtration technologies, supporting future top-line and margin growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f84l2umf-analysts-boost-pentair-price-target-as-margin-strength-and-data-center-demand-drive-optimism\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what kind of revenue path and margin profile need to line up for that fair value to make sense? The narrative leans on measured growth, richer profitability and a future earnings multiple that assumes investors keep paying up for those cash flows.

The key checkpoints will be quarterly updates on U.S. procedure volumes, handpiece revenue mix, progress toward the 65% and then 68% to 70% gross margin targets, and any commentary on competitive responses from larger urology and surgical robotics companies. The company’s progress toward its goal of positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2026 is likely to be an important marker for many investors.</p> <p>To ensure you are always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for PROCEPT BioRobotics, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/PRCT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for PROCEPT BioRobotics</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>DCF Fair Value Far Above Market Price</h2> <ul> <li>The supplied DCF fair value of US$399.57 is materially higher than the current share price of US$74.03, and the summary also references an analyst median implied upside of about 49.4% from their own targets.</li> <li>Consensus style narratives see a mixed picture in these numbers, and the tension is clear when you set the metrics side by side:\n    <ul> <li>The DCF fair value and analyst upside expectations sit against the reality that trailing revenue is growing at 9% annually and that earnings include a US$32.7 million one off gain, which may not repeat.</li> <li>At the same time, ANI has become profitable over the last 12 months with reported 44.9% annual earnings growth over 5 years, so part of the optimism in those higher valuation marks is grounded in a clear shift from losses to earnings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks,
