The recent expansion update is central to that story, because it moves the company from talking about growth to actually pouring capital into mills, fleet and tailings to lift processing capacity over the next couple of years. In the short term, this adds a tangible catalyst around meeting staged throughput targets, but it also magnifies near term execution and cost risks at a time when the share price has already run very hard and volatility is elevated. Combined with recent equity financing, the expansion plan may reshape how investors weigh dilution, valuation and operational delivery in the months ahead.</p> However, one of the biggest issues now is how rising capital needs interact with an already rich sales multiple.\n\nDespite retreating, Sierra Madre Gold and Silver's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-sm/sierra-madre-gold-and-silver-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how much</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-sm/sierra-madre-gold-and-silver-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:SM 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/94ed7f80-654d-4b8d-b27d-5a5d06a434c1/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:SM 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s two fair value views span from CA$2.85 up to CA$10.67, underlining how far apart individual expectations can be.

Simply Wall St then extends analyst style estimates out to 2035, with projected free cash flow figures in the range of about $115.6 million in 2026 and $100.5 million in 2035, and discounts each of those back to today using its own assumptions.</p> <p>Adding those discounted cash flows together and accounting for a terminal value gives an estimated intrinsic value of about $53.33 per share. Against a recent share price of US$140.40, the model implies the stock is 163.2% above this DCF estimate, which indicates M/I Homes is heavily overvalued on this specific cash flow based view.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests M/I Homes may be overvalued by 163.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-mho/m-i-homes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MHO Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78ecf0fc-77ec-49a6-a56d-87519a35c5da/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MHO Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-mho/m-i-homes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for M/I Homes.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: M/I Homes Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like M/I Homes, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to compare what you are paying for each dollar of earnings with other stocks. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth and lower perceived risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more modest or risks are higher.</p> <p>M/I Homes currently trades on a P/E of 8.98x. That sits below the Consumer Durables industry average of 13.20x and also below the peer average of 14.93x, which on simple comparisons can make the shares look inexpensive relative to similar businesses.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for M/I Homes is 13.31x. This is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be given the company’s earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and assessed risks. Because it is tailored to the company, the Fair Ratio can be more informative than just lining the stock up against broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 13.31x with the current P/E of 8.98x suggests M/I Homes trades at a discount on this earnings based view.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-mho/m-i-homes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MHO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78ecf0fc-77ec-49a6-a56d-87519a35c5da/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MHO P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This simply means writing a short story for M/I Homes that connects your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and a Fair Value, then comparing that Fair Value with the current price in an easy tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that millions of investors use. Narratives automatically refresh when new data like earnings or news is added. You can then see, for example, one investor building a more optimistic M/I Homes story around a Fair Value of US$185 while another anchors a more cautious view around US$150, and use those different perspectives to judge for yourself whether the current price looks high, low or about right.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for M/I Homes? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/MHO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-mho/m-i-homes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MHO 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78ecf0fc-77ec-49a6-a56d-87519a35c5da/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MHO 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Put simply, if revenue grows at &lt;15% pa and margins fall to &lt;20% average over the next 3 years, that implies a pretty consistent growth rate that contradicts the high PE ratio for this stock. A reasonable investor is not going to pay 50+ PE (for 2% returns on current price) for a company with proven growth &lt;15%. Further, with the risk factors in play especially AI, the discount rate used by any investor should be higher to justify the returns. Thus, even allowing for revenue growth at 15% and margins at 20%, with the discount rate holding at 7.08%, if PE acceptance falls to 30x then the indicated fair value is $253.14.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Infinity Natural Resources is priced attractively right now, you are not alone. This article focuses on what the current share price might mean for value-driven investors.</li> <li>Over the shorter term, the stock has seen a 1.5% decline over the last 7 days, a 4.3% return over 30 days and a 9.2% return year to date, while the 1-year return sits at a 14.2% decline from the previous level.</li> <li>These mixed returns sit against a backdrop where investors are paying closer attention to Infinity Natural Resources' position in the US energy sector and how its asset base and commodity exposure fit into broader portfolio decisions. Recent coverage has focused on the company as a pure play on the energy space, which has helped frame expectations around risk, potential volatility and how the stock might respond to sector-wide shifts.</li> <li>On our checks, Infinity Natural Resources currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-inr/infinity-natural-resources/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6 on valuation</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow (FCF) is a loss of $283.8 million, so the company is currently consuming cash rather than generating it. Analysts and internal estimates project FCF turning positive, with projected FCF of $262.0 million in 2030. Between 2026 and 2035, Simply Wall St uses a mix of analyst forecasts and extrapolated estimates to build a ten year cash flow path, all in $ and all below $1b, so discussed here in millions.</p> <p>Discounting those projected cash flows back to today produces an estimated intrinsic value of $135.91 per share. Against the current share price used in this model, the DCF implies the stock is 88.2% undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Infinity Natural Resources is undervalued by 88.2%.

Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Infinity Natural Resources currently trades on a P/S of 0.81x. That sits below the Oil and Gas industry average P/S of 1.69x and also below the peer group average of 4.09x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Infinity Natural Resources is 4.27x, which is the P/S level suggested by factors such as its earnings growth outlook, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks.</p> <p>The Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple industry or peer comparison because it adjusts for company specific factors instead of assuming one size fits all.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 4.27x with the current P/S of 0.81x indicates that the shares are trading below that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-inr/infinity-natural-resources/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:INR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e4fc179f-c523-41fc-a85d-7bd76c3b2750/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:INR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might lean toward US$18 if they are more cautious about gas prices, capital needs and how share repurchases affect flexibility, and Narratives let you see and compare both in one place.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Infinity Natural Resources? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/INR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-inr/infinity-natural-resources\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:INR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e4fc179f-c523-41fc-a85d-7bd76c3b2750/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:INR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>DigitalBridge pausing its usual earnings call and guidance puts a spotlight on the proposed SoftBank deal rather than the quarter itself. That is important context, because the latest numbers are mixed. Q4 2025 revenue of US$47.9 million compares with US$66.17 million a year earlier and full year revenue of US$93.96 million compares with US$607.03 million, yet the company reported Q4 net income of US$65.06 million versus a net loss of US$5.05 million and full year net income of US$141.87 million versus US$70.52 million. That combination of lower revenue with higher profit points to one off items, portfolio reshaping, or business mix changes that are harder for you to assess without a live Q&amp;A. With SoftBank in the picture, the key question becomes how DigitalBridge’s fee based, digital-infrastructure-focused model might sit inside a larger group that is already active around AI and data centers. Until management gives more detail, you are relying on filings and the investor presentation to judge how repeatable recent earnings are and how much of the future story depends on SoftBank ownership.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The DigitalBridge Group Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on SoftBank lines up with the narrative that positions DigitalBridge at the center of AI driven data center demand, as SoftBank has been linked to AI and digital infrastructure themes globally.</li> <li>The lack of guidance and limited color on the large swing in revenue and earnings could challenge the narrative’s emphasis on recurring revenue and earnings predictability.</li> <li>The SoftBank proposal itself is not explicitly embedded in the existing narrative, so any future change in ownership, capital support, or growth priorities may alter how those earlier AI and power related catalysts play out.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/qjjqlmhx-ai-demand-and-global-expansion-will-transform-digital-infrastructure-ph16\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for DigitalBridge Group</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ The decision to skip an earnings call and detailed guidance reduces near term transparency just as investors are trying to interpret a large swing in reported revenue and net income.</li> <li>⚠️ A potential change of control raises execution risk around culture, incentives, and capital allocation, especially with strong competitors like Blackstone, Brookfield, and KKR also active in digital infrastructure.</li> <li>🎁 The proposed SoftBank transaction could provide deeper pockets and a broader ecosystem for scaling data center and AI related projects, which may support DigitalBridge’s platform ambitions.</li> <li>🎁 Recent profitability, including Q4 net income of US$65.06 million, gives you more evidence of earning power than a period that only contained losses, even if some items may be one time in nature.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you will want to track three things closely. First, any additional detail on the SoftBank terms, including timing, conditions, and what DigitalBridge’s operating structure would look like after closing. Second, disclosures in the 2025 Form 10 K and investor materials that break down what drove the sharp revenue change and profit improvement, and whether management labels any items as non recurring. Third, any commentary on how DigitalBridge plans to compete for AI related data center and power projects against other large asset managers if the SoftBank transaction is delayed or does not proceed.

Higher compensation often reflects board confidence in management after a solid year, and Fastenal did report double digit daily sales growth and market share gains in 2025. At the same time, insider buying can suggest that executives and directors are comfortable owning more stock at current prices, which some investors read as a sign that internal expectations remain constructive.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Fastenal Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The higher CEO compensation and insider buying sit alongside Fastenal’s push into digital sales and Fastenal Managed Inventory technology, which management has highlighted as central to growth and margin resilience.</li> <li>Rising executive pay could be questioned if future margins or growth fall short of what is needed to support the company’s investments in supply-chain diversification and on-site distribution.</li> <li>The nearly US$8m in government contracts adds a public-sector angle that is not a major focus of the existing narrative, which has centered more on large industrial customers and digital channels.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ei8gojit-digital-solutions-and-resilient-supply-chains-will-drive-future-strength-ghav\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Fastenal</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A large increase in CEO compensation could become a concern if future performance does not align with pay, especially compared with peers like W.W. Grainger or MSC Industrial.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged at least one risk, including questions around dividend cover by free cash flow, which may influence how you think about capital returns versus reinvestment.</li> <li>🎁 Insider share purchases over the past six months may indicate confidence from those closest to the business in Fastenal’s direction and execution.</li> <li>🎁 Additional government contracts can help diversify revenue sources and provide more visibility on a portion of sales alongside existing industrial customers.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track whether insider buying continues, how executive pay trends relative to sales, earnings, and cash flow, and whether Fastenal wins more national or government contracts that complement its digital and on-site offerings. Comparing Fastenal’s progress and governance practices with distributors like W.W. Grainger and MSC Industrial can also help you judge whether the compensation and contract trends are aligned with long-term value creation.</p> <p>To keep up with how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Fastenal, visit the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/FAST\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Fastenal</a> to stay updated on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This comes even though the 1 year total shareholder return is a 10.50% loss, while the 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns of 86.83% and 88.55% point to a much stronger longer term picture.</p> <p>If this move in a specialized healthcare name has you thinking about where else growth themes might emerge, it could be worth scanning our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 healthcare AI stocks</a> as another potential hunting ground.</p> <p>So with LeMaitre Vascular showing solid multi year total returns, growing revenue and net income, and trading at $91.38, is the current price leaving meaningful upside on the table, or is the market already factoring in future growth?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 12.8% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, LeMaitre Vascular’s fair value sits at $104.78 versus the last close of $91.38. This sets up a valuation gap that hinges on future growth and margins.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Strong pipeline of biologics and next-generation products, combined with ongoing regulatory wins, enhances pricing power and product mix; this supports premium pricing and improved gross margins, with successful launches expected to materially contribute to long-term earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ihxgc0hy-european-and-global-demographics-will-expand-minimally-invasive-care-wrzv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what kind of revenue trajectory and margin profile investors are baking into that fair value, and how those cash flows stack up once discounted?

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>For dividend-focused investors, Eastman Chemical’s full year update links directly to how dependable its cash returns might be. The company highlighted strong cash generation and again affirmed a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, which continues a multi year pattern of regular payments. At the same time, Simply Wall St’s risk checks point out that the dividend is not well covered by free cash flow and that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. The recent issue of US$600m in 4.50% senior unsecured notes due 2031 adds another fixed claim on future cash. Together, those details suggest you may want to look closely at payout ratios, interest costs, and how much cash is left for reinvestment after dividends and debt service.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Eastman Chemical Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The focus on cost reduction, cash generation, and expanding molecular recycling at Kingsport supports the narrative that efficiency and asset utilization can help free up cash to fund both growth projects and dividends.</li> <li>The additional debt and flagged concerns about cash flow coverage could challenge the idea that cost savings alone will keep returns to shareholders comfortable if end market demand stays weak.</li> <li>The fixed income issuance and detailed recycling ramp at Kingsport add extra color on capital structure and sustainability execution that is not fully captured in the high level narrative.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/ujv3juw5-commodity-end-markets-and-recycling-initiatives-will-shape-recovery-prospects-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Eastman Chemical</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Profit margins are lower than last year and debt is not well covered by operating cash flow, which could limit room for dividend growth if trading conditions stay soft.</li> <li>⚠️ The dividend is not well covered by free cash flows, so a higher cash commitment to interest on the new 4.50% notes may tighten headroom for future payouts.</li> <li>🎁 Eastman is trading at a discount to one fair value estimate and is viewed as good value compared to peers such as Dow and LyondellBasell, which can be appealing for income investors willing to accept some risk.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow, and cost savings plus Kingsport recycling progress support the idea that free cash flow could improve over time if execution stays on track.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it makes sense to watch three things if you follow Eastman Chemical for income. First, how free cash flow tracks against the dividend and interest costs on the new US$600m notes. Second, whether margins begin to recover toward prior levels, which would give more support to the payout. Third, progress at Kingsport in converting recycling volumes into consistent earnings and cash.

These plants can run consistently, which lines up with the 24/7 needs of hyperscalers and large corporates. The reported 13.9% growth in adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of 2025 sits alongside a dividend profile that includes a common dividend with a five year compound annual growth rate of 10.7% and a preferred Series A payout of US$80.00 per share on an annualized basis. That combination suggests management is comfortable returning more cash to shareholders while still writing large checks for acquisitions. For you as an investor, the key question is whether the earnings base from these acquired assets and power contracts can comfortably service higher interest costs, ongoing capital spending, and both common and preferred dividends over time.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Vistra Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The data center driven acquisitions and new power purchase agreements tie directly into the narrative that rising electricity demand and long duration contracts can support revenue growth and EBITDA expansion.</li> <li>Heavier use of acquisitions and fossil fuel assets, plus a higher leverage profile around 3x adjusted EBITDA, echoes the narrative’s caution that debt and regulatory pressure on gas and nuclear could constrain future margins.</li> <li>The recent step up in common and preferred dividends is not fully reflected in the narrative and adds another layer of capital allocation that could influence how much cash is left for renewables and storage projects.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/d88nwa9z-vst-accelerating-power-demand-will-drive-new-nuclear-and-gas-asset-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Vistra</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which could limit financial flexibility if borrowing costs stay high or new projects run over budget.</li> <li>⚠️ Profit margins of 5.6% compared to 11.4% last year indicate pressure on profitability, which may matter if power prices or plant availability move against Vistra.</li> <li>🎁 Vistra is assessed as trading at a large discount to one estimate of fair value, which some investors may see as providing a margin of safety if the thesis on data center demand plays out.</li> <li>🎁 Earnings are forecast to grow 24.84% per year, so if acquisitions and long term contracts perform as planned, the current investment and dividend strategy could be supported by a rising earnings base.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how quickly the newly acquired natural gas and nuclear plants are integrated, what returns Vistra reports on that US$4b outlay, and how stable EBITDA looks as more data center contracts come online. Keep an eye on leverage and interest coverage, because more acquisitions or higher dividends could stretch the balance sheet if power markets turn less favorable. It is also useful to track how Vistra positions itself against peers such as Constellation Energy and Cameco linked nuclear interests, especially around securing multi decade data center power agreements.

With Gucci facing a reset, the group is looking more closely at how each house contributes to its overall profile at a time when demand for high end products is less buoyant than in recent years.</p> <p>For you as an investor, the focus now is on how Kering balances Gucci’s turnaround efforts with the growing visibility of its other brands.

As Gucci works through a repositioning, management is effectively asking the rest of the portfolio to carry more weight. For you, the key question is whether houses like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta can deepen their identity without diluting group focus or stretching creative and operational resources at a time when luxury demand is less buoyant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kering Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The increased emphasis on multiple houses lines up with the narrative of product refreshes and store optimization.

More creative shifts and portfolio changes raise the chance that some collections or market bets do not resonate with consumers.</li> <li>The current news focuses on brand mix and positioning, while the narrative also points to factors like tourism trends and secondhand luxury, which may not be fully reflected in how investors interpret this reset.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/14mdfsvn-ker-beauty-unit-sale-and-licensing-deal-will-shape-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kering</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around Gucci’s repositioning and other creative shifts, which could affect demand if new collections do not connect with core and aspirational buyers.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that Kering’s interest payments are not well covered by earnings. This can limit flexibility if trading conditions stay soft or turn weaker.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts expect earnings to grow strongly over the coming years. This suggests upside if Kering’s portfolio reset and cost discipline play out as planned.</li> <li>🎁 A stronger role for brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta could reduce reliance on a single label and help Kering compete more evenly with peers such as LVMH and Hermès.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Gucci’s refreshed positioning shows up in product traction, pricing, and brand heat, especially with US aspirational shoppers. You can also track whether Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and other houses gain more visibility in key regions without eroding Kering’s overall margin profile. Competitive moves from large groups like LVMH and Richemont on pricing, store openings, and marketing will give extra context for how Kering’s choices are landing with luxury consumers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Kering, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/ENXTPA/KER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Kering</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over the past four quarters, the company reported revenue increasing from US$314.7 million in Q4 2024 to US$394.6 million in Q4 2025, while basic EPS moved from US$0.07 to US$0.03. Trailing twelve month EPS stood at a loss of US$0.13, so the latest quarterly profit comes against a year that was still loss making in aggregate.

loss of US$31.5 million, so the Q4 profit of US$6.5 million sits within a year that was still loss making overall.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights strong adoption of AI marketing tools and first party data, and this snapshot partly fits that story, but:\n    <ul> <li>Revenue in the trailing set has moved from US$901.4 million to US$1.3b, while losses narrowed from US$120.3 million to US$31.5 million, so the business is still absorbing costs even as it scales.</li> <li>Analysts in that consensus view expect revenue growth to continue, yet the current trailing loss means the path from growth to steady profitability is not yet visible in the historical numbers alone.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong revenue and shrinking losses look encouraging, but the fact that the last 12 months still show a net loss keeps the focus on how quickly the model can turn that scale into consistent profits. <a class=\"company-report-links\"

Zeta Global Holdings.</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation signals: 3.4x P/S and DCF fair value of US$30.27</h2> <ul> <li>Zeta is trading on a P/S of 3.4x compared with a peer average of 5.5x and a US Software average of 3.5x, and the provided DCF fair value of US$30.27 sits above the current share price of US$17.85.</li> <li>Bulls argue that faster earnings growth and margin improvement could justify that gap, and the current data partially lines up with that, but also raises questions:\n    <ul> <li>The bullish view references shrinking losses at about 19.6% per year over five years and strong forecast earnings growth, which ties back to the trailing loss of US$31.5 million being much smaller than the earlier US$120.3 million loss in the dataset.</li> <li>At the same time, with the company still loss making on a trailing basis, the lower P/S and the DCF fair value of US$30.27 versus US$17.85 depend on those future margin gains actually coming through, rather than on current profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these numbers to their upside case, check out how they frame the opportunity in <a

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Zeta Global Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Unprofitable today, bearish view questions durability</h2> <ul> <li>Even after Q4’s US$6.5 million profit, the trailing twelve month figures still show a basic EPS loss of US$0.13 and total net loss of US$31.5 million, which bearish investors point to when they question the durability of the model.</li> <li>Bears focus on data privacy, client concentration, and heavy tech spend, and the current figures give them some support alongside some pushback:\n    <ul> <li>The ongoing trailing loss and prior quarterly losses of US$21.6 million, US$12.8 million, and US$3.6 million in FY 2025 help skeptics argue that investments in AI and data infrastructure have yet to translate into stable bottom line results.</li> <li>On the other hand, the move from a US$120.3 million loss in an earlier trailing period to US$31.5 million in the latest snapshot suggests the cost base and revenue scale are at least moving closer to the profitability point that bearish forecasts still treat as uncertain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors are asking whether this improving loss profile is enough to offset the structural risks they see around data and client concentration, and you can see how they build that case in <a class=\"company-report-links\"

The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is reported at about US$699 million. Simply Wall St then extends this with cash flow projections out to 2035, starting with an estimate of US$663.2 million in 2026 and US$743.3 million in 2035, with intermediate years in between. Analysts typically provide forecasts for up to five years, so the later years are extrapolated from earlier trends.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$197.14 per share. With the recent share price at US$755.43, this particular model implies the stock is very expensive relative to its cash flow estimate, with an intrinsic discount indicating it is about 283.2% above the DCF value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ubiquiti may be overvalued by 283.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ubiquiti.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Ubiquiti Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Ubiquiti, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you are paying directly to the earnings the business is currently generating.</p> <p>What counts as a normal or fair P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower one.</p> <p>Ubiquiti currently trades on a P/E of 51.45x. That sits above the Communications industry average P/E of about 40.47x, yet below the peer group average of 77.85x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 36.24x for Ubiquiti, which is an estimate of the P/E that would fit its specific earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific qualities instead of assuming that all businesses in a sector should trade at similar multiples.</p> <p>Comparing Ubiquiti’s actual P/E of 51.45x with the Fair Ratio of 36.24x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These different assumptions can lead to very different fair values and therefore very different views on whether the current US$755.43 price looks attractive or stretched.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ubiquiti? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Pulse Biosciences at around US$19.21 is priced fairly or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article walks through what the numbers indicate about its value.</li> <li>The share price has had a mixed run, with a 24.5% decline over the last week, a 34.1% gain over the last month, a 43.5% gain year to date, a 0.7% decline over the last year, a very large 3 year return of around 7x, and a 30.8% decline over five years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage around Pulse Biosciences has focused on its position in the healthcare space and shifting investor expectations. This helps explain why the share price has moved sharply over different time frames. This context matters, because changing sentiment can affect how investors weigh potential future outcomes against the current share price.</li> <li>Right now, our valuation model gives Pulse Biosciences a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>.

This process arrives at an estimate of what the business might be worth now.</p> <p>For Pulse Biosciences, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on projected free cash flows in dollars. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $54.7 million. Analyst and extrapolated estimates in the model show cash flows staying negative in the near term, then turning positive by 2030, with projected free cash flow of $10 million in that year. Further out, the model extends these projections through 2035 using estimated growth rates.</p> <p>After discounting all those projected cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2.62 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $19.21, this DCF output suggests the stock is very expensive relative to the cash flows assumed in the model, or in other words, very overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Pulse Biosciences may be overvalued by 633.7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Pulse Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Pulse Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies that are not yet producing consistent profits, P/B is often more useful than P/E because it compares the share price with the accounting value of net assets rather than earnings that may still be negative or volatile.</p> <p>In general, a higher multiple is easier to justify when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while a lower multiple tends to reflect more modest expectations or higher uncertainty. That is why context matters when you look at any headline ratio.</p> <p>Pulse Biosciences currently trades on a P/B of about 16.19x. This sits above the Medical Equipment industry average P/B of about 2.44x and also above the peer group average of around 3.21x. Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the preferred multiple, which estimates what a reasonable P/B might be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can give a more focused view than a simple comparison with industry or peer averages. In this case, the actual 16.19x P/B sits above the Fair Ratio used in the model, which points to the shares trading on a richer multiple than that framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you write your own story for Pulse Biosciences by linking your expectations for revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast, a fair value and a clear comparison of that fair value with today’s price. This is all within an easy Community tool that millions of investors use, and that automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might set a higher fair value around US$30 based on a very optimistic view of thyroid and cardiac adoption, while another might use a lower fair value around US$22 based on more moderate assumptions. You can immediately see how far each view sits from the current price to help you decide what you want to do.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Pulse Biosciences? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/PLSE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
