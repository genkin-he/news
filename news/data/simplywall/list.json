San Antonio College in California.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nasdaq-wldn/willdan-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Willdan Group.</a></p> <p>Despite the strong contract wins and record financial results, Willdan Group’s share price has seen a sharp pullback recently, with a 1 day share price return of negative 25.47% and a 30 day share price return of negative 29.37%. At the same time, the 1 year total shareholder return sits at 172.60%, which points to fading short term momentum after a very strong multi year run.</p> <p>If this volatility has you thinking about where else growth and infrastructure themes might show up in your portfolio, you can scan our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> for other grid focused names that may be worth a closer look.</p> <p>With the share price pulling back after record results, yet still sitting on a very large 1 year total return and trading below some analyst targets, you have to ask: is Willdan now undervalued, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 38.5% Undervalued</h2> <p>With Willdan Group last closing at $89.14 against a narrative fair value of $145, the current share price sits well below that central estimate, setting up a clear gap between market pricing and this widely followed view.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Long term and increasing utility and municipal contracts, typically 3 to 5 years in duration and funded through stable sources, are contributing to recurring revenue and improved earnings visibility, reducing earnings volatility and supporting higher net margins.</em></p> <p><em>Ongoing investments and planning for grid modernization, combined with the company's strong reputation with utility commissions and government agencies, position Willdan to benefit disproportionately from federal/state decarbonization mandates and infrastructure modernization initiatives, supporting sustained revenue and EBITDA growth over the long term.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/7vftqh7c-electrification-and-ai-data-centers-will-empower-grid-modernization-twpf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what has to happen for that higher fair value to stack up?

For a utility like Hokkaido Electric it reflects what investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings given its regulated returns, capital intensity and cash flow profile.</p> <p>Here, the stock is described as expensive versus its immediate peer average P/E of 4.2x. It is also framed as good value against the Asian Electric Utilities average of 17.6x and a fair P/E estimate of 9.5x, suggesting the market is pricing its earnings materially lower than the level that model implies it could move towards.</p> <p>Relative to the broader JP market P/E of 15.6x, the 4.4x P/E is also much lower, which again underlines how compressed the multiple looks compared with both domestic equities and the sector wide context.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Hokkaido Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 4.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh regulatory changes or project delays at Ishikariwan Shinko that could affect earnings, cash flows, and how reliable that P/E looks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Hokkaido Electric Power Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points the other way</h2> <p>While the 4.4x P/E suggests room to move closer to the 9.5x fair ratio, our DCF model is more conservative. On that approach, Hokkaido Electric at ¥1,230.5 is trading above an estimated future cash flow value of ¥870.28, which implies limited upside and some valuation risk.

The biggest risk is still its dependence on a few large payor and TPA relationships, and this update does not materially change that.</p> <p>The new US$75 million share repurchase program, capped at US$20 million per year through 2030, is the most relevant announcement here. It intersects directly with the near term focus on cost control and cash generation, since buybacks will draw on cash on hand and operating cash flows. For investors, the real test is whether Claritev can support this program while funding ongoing AI, cloud, and international initiatives that underpin its longer term growth catalysts.</p> <p>Yet even with shrinking losses and a buyback in place, investors still need to weigh the concentration risk in Claritev’s largest client contracts and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-ctev/claritev/tkit8a2w-analysts-boost-claritev-valuation-amid-growth-optimism-and-strategic-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Claritev (it's free!)</a></p><p>Claritev's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $90.0 million earnings by 2028.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 36.6% and very large 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns suggest momentum has been building over several years rather than just in the latest rally.</p> <p>If Chartwell’s run has you thinking more broadly about where capital could work hardest next, it may be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 healthcare AI stocks</a> for fresh ideas across the sector.</p> <p>With Chartwell generating revenue of CA$1.11b and net income of CA$29.41m, and trading only slightly below a CA$23.70 analyst price target, it is worth asking whether there is still a buying opportunity here or whether the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, Chartwell’s fair value comes out at CA$23.05, a touch above the CA$22.22 last close. This puts the focus on what assumptions are doing the heavy lifting.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chartwell's financial results and guidance point to a sustained increase in demand for senior housing, driven by a rapidly growing seniors population and persistent supply constraints, supporting rising occupancy and driving long term revenue and NOI growth. The company is executing on a strategy of acquiring and developing newer, larger, and more operationally efficient properties expected to produce higher occupancy rates, greater per suite NOI, and enhanced margins as lease ups mature.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what sits behind that CA$23.05 figure? The narrative leans on robust top line expansion, firmer margins, and a rich future earnings multiple that is described as anything but conservative.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$23.05 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the picture could change if elevated leverage and refinancing costs squeeze margins, or if higher labour expenses erode the modest profit improvements that analysts are banking on.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/healthcare/tsx-csh.un/chartwell-retirement-residences-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Chartwell Retirement Residences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle: rich sales multiple vs fair ratio</h2> <p>The AI fair value story leans toward modest undervaluation, but the sales multiple tells a different tale. Chartwell trades on a P/S of 6.4x, far above the North American Healthcare industry at 1.2x and peers at 1.3x, and well ahead of its own fair ratio of 3.5x.</p> <p>That gap suggests the market is already paying a premium for future growth. This leaves less room for error if margins, interest costs or occupancy do not line up with expectations.

The latest full-year 2025 results show higher revenue and net income, with basic EPS up to US$1.37, which helps validate that story after a flatter profit track record. The affirmed US$0.09 quarterly dividend reinforces a message of stability rather than signaling any major shift in capital allocation, so it is unlikely to change the near term catalysts in a material way. Instead, the more immediate focus remains on how the company manages input costs, protects margins, and justifies a relatively rich earnings multiple after a strong 12‑month total return. The recent results support confidence, but they also raise the bar for expectations.</p> However, that higher valuation makes any stumble on margins or demand more painful for shareholders to absorb.\nTootsie Roll Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 10%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9f8185b7-359c-4591-99fd-ca67babeda42/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Simply Wall St Community members currently offer just one fair value view at about US$38.53, giving you a single reference point rather than a broad range of opinions.

The swing to a US$61.8 million net loss makes execution risk around restructuring and cost savings more immediate, but does not fundamentally change the key near-term catalyst: progress on returning core operations to consistent profitability. The biggest risk remains that EV-related weakness and restructuring drag out longer than expected, prolonging losses.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the completion of the multi-year share repurchase program is most relevant here. Buying back 2,120,103 shares, or 11.48% of the share base for US$147.44 million, slightly amplifies the impact of any future earnings recovery on a per-share basis, but it also sharpens focus on whether the new quarterly sales guidance of US$193 million to US$208 million is a step toward stabilizing results or a prelude to further...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers/jjp5kfkp-analyst-maintains-rogers-price-target-amid-stable-valuation-and-modest-profit-margin-adjustment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Rogers (it's free!)</a></p><p>Rogers’ narrative projects $921.6 million revenue and $83.3 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers/jjp5kfkp-analyst-maintains-rogers-price-target-amid-stable-valuation-and-modest-profit-margin-adjustment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Rogers' forecasts yield a $124.33 fair value</a>, a 15% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ROG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a6f41413-9bad-48be-bc64-776d511e4c77/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ROG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>By contrast, the most bullish analysts were assuming revenue could reach about US$1.0 billion and earnings near US$318.0 million, which is far more optimistic than the curamik restructuring risk highlighted earlier, and you should recognize that views like this may shift meaningfully after the latest net loss and guidance.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 2 other fair value estimates on Rogers</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 15% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

The Michael Campbell hire directly targets the key short term catalyst, a potential DURAVYU launch, but it does not change the fact that any delay or disappointment in the pivotal trials remains the central risk for a company with minimal current revenue.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the Phase 3 DURAVYU update following the second DSMC review in November 2025 is most relevant here, because it kept the pivotal program on track toward potential commercialization. Campbell’s arrival now sits on top of that clinical backdrop, linking trial progress with an increasingly built out launch and manufacturing footprint, which together frame both the upside catalyst of a successful entry into wet AMD and DME and the execution risk if uptake proves slower than expected.</p> <p>Yet against that excitement, investors should be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint/nwrya9z6-phase-iii-trials-in-wet-amd-will-expand-market-reach-ncqs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on EyePoint (it's free!)</a></p><p>EyePoint's narrative projects $146.7 million revenue and $34.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint/nwrya9z6-phase-iii-trials-in-wet-amd-will-expand-market-reach-ncqs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how EyePoint's forecasts yield a $36.08 fair value</a>, a 105% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"EYPT 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/3922204e-9934-411a-90c5-e170feacb161/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>EYPT 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest estimate analysts were assuming only about 7.9% annual revenue growth and ongoing losses, so compared with those views, you should see Campbell’s appointment and the Phase III dependence as parts of a much more cautious story that might look different once updated forecasts reflect this new hire.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-eypt/eyepoint\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on EyePoint</a> - why the stock might be worth just $36.08!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

At the same time, longer term total shareholder returns of 61.69% over one year and 168.29% over five years point to gains that investors will compare with current expectations.</p> <p>If this leadership news has you thinking more broadly about where growth could come from in mobility and manufacturing, it might be worth scanning <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_robotics\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473746/robotics-andamp-automation-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 robotics and automation stocks</a> as a fresh set of ideas to review next.</p> <p>With Aisin trading at ¥2,779.5 and sitting at an estimated 45% discount to one intrinsic value measure and around 9% below the average analyst price target, is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Preferred P/E of 12.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Aisin's current P/E of 12.2x sits at an interesting crossroads, with the shares at ¥2,779.5 and various signals pointing in different directions compared with both peers and an internally estimated fair ratio.</p> <p>The P/E multiple compares the company’s share price with its earnings per share, so it essentially reflects what investors are currently willing to pay for each unit of profit. For an auto components group like Aisin, this is a common yardstick because earnings are a direct link to its large base of recurring supply contracts and exposure to vehicle production volumes.</p> <p>Here, the picture is mixed. On one hand, Aisin is described as expensive versus the broader JP Auto Components industry average P/E of 11.4x, which suggests the market is paying a premium relative to many sector peers. On the other hand, the same 12.2x P/E is assessed as good value compared with an estimated fair P/E of 15.5x, as well as against a peer average of 19.3x in a separate comparison. Those reference points imply that if valuations shifted closer to the higher peer averages or the fair ratio, the multiple could move up from current levels rather than down.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7259/aisin-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Aisin</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-earnings of 12.2x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, investors still need to watch for any slowdown in annual revenue and net income growth and for how the leadership shift affects execution on Aisin's broad product portfolio.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7259/aisin-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Aisin narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on Aisin's value using our DCF model</h2> <p>The P/E story suggests some room for upside, but our DCF model presents a stronger valuation case. On this measure, Aisin at ¥2,779.5 is trading at a 45.4% discount to an estimated future cash flow value of ¥5,091.84.

The Recorlev patent lawsuit is important for protecting potential long term cash flows, but in the near term the key catalyst is still execution around upcoming earnings and commercial performance, while the biggest risk remains Xeris’s reliance on a small set of branded products.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the upcoming March 2, 2026 earnings report, with consensus expecting US$0.04 EPS and full year 2025 revenue around US$292,000,000, looks especially relevant. Those results will give investors a fresh read on how Recorlev, Gvoke, and Keveyis are performing just as Xeris moves to defend Recorlev’s patents, and may influence how investors weigh the benefit of extended exclusivity against ongoing R&amp;D and SG&amp;A spending.</p> <p>Yet while the lawsuit aims to secure Recorlev’s future, investors should also factor in the risk that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings/9pjzm8dt-xers-higher-2025-revenue-guidance-will-drive-measured-financial-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Xeris Biopharma Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>Xeris Biopharma Holdings' narrative projects $440.9 million revenue and $84.8 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings/9pjzm8dt-xers-higher-2025-revenue-guidance-will-drive-measured-financial-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Xeris Biopharma Holdings' forecasts yield a $11.14 fair value</a>, a 82% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XERS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/34985fb8-c88a-498a-8524-1011a674e966/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XERS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest estimating analysts were already more cautious, even while assuming revenue could reach about US$414,200,000 and earnings about US$21,400,000 by 2028, so this fresh legal uncertainty around Recorlev’s patents could push their already more pessimistic view further, and it is worth asking yourself which version of Xeris’s future you find more convincing.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 4 other fair value estimates on Xeris Biopharma Holdings</a> - why the stock might be worth 23% less than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your Xeris Biopharma Holdings research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free Xeris Biopharma Holdings research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate Xeris Biopharma Holdings' overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Ready For A Different Approach?</h2><p>These stocks are moving-our analysis flagged them today.

This points to a discount at the current ¥1,570.5 share price.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so it effectively tells you how much investors are paying for each unit of earnings. For a real estate group that is already profitable and generating net income of ¥92,302 million, P/E is a straightforward way to gauge how the market is pricing those earnings today.</p> <p>Here, the company screens as good value against several yardsticks. The current 12.1x P/E is below the estimated fair P/E of 16.2x. It also sits below the peer average of 14.3x, the Japan real estate industry average of 12.8x, and the broader Japan market at 15.6x. That combination suggests the market is pricing Tokyu Fudosan Holdings at a lower earnings multiple than these reference points, while our fair ratio work points to a level the market could move towards if perceptions of its earnings strength and growth potential align with those benchmarks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-3289/tokyu-fudosan-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Tokyu Fudosan Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-earnings of 12.1x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you are still relying on analyst estimates for that fair P/E, and on earnings that tie closely to real estate and energy markets, which can be cyclical.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-3289/tokyu-fudosan-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Tokyu Fudosan Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Paints A Different Picture</h2> <p>While the 12.1x P/E suggests Tokyu Fudosan Holdings looks inexpensive, our DCF model points a very different way. It indicates an estimated future cash flow value of ¥654.05 compared with the current ¥1,570.5 share price. On that basis, the shares screen as overvalued rather than cheap.
