Despite big moves in the sector and recent expansion of its power management and imaging technology portfolio, ON Semiconductor’s 1-year total shareholder return has slumped to -30.2%. Its 5-year total return is still up nearly 99%.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

One common approach is to try and find a company with <em>returns</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Although, when we looked at <strong>Wienerberger</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIE:WIE</a>), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

To calculate this metric for Wienerberger, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.073 = €346m ÷ (€6.3b - €1.6b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Wienerberger has an ROCE of 7.3%.</strong> On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 7.2%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Wienerberger </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/416194-roce-1-dark-2/1761827143455\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">WBAG:WIE Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Wienerberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

The company has employed 36% more capital in the last  five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 7.3%.   Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.   </p><h2> Our Take On Wienerberger's ROCE </h2><p> In conclusion, Wienerberger has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.       And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 29% to shareholders over the last  five years.  Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.    </p><p> If you'd like to know about the risks facing Wienerberger, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign</strong></a> that you should be aware of.   </p><p> While Wienerberger may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

This narrative is based on both sector momentum and a dramatic re-rating of future earnings potential, which could be a turning point for ambitious investors.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ondas anticipates record revenue growth in 2025, primarily driven by Ondas Autonomous Systems (OAS), due to significant backlog and expanding programs with Optimus and Iron Drone systems in defense and homeland security sectors.

The company’s price-to-book ratio stands at 26x, much higher than both the US Communications industry average of 2.3x and its peer average of 11.8x. This signals that investors are paying a steep premium compared to the broader sector, which could mean higher valuation risk if growth stumbles.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Expro Group Holdings to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Expro Group Holdings' Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Expro Group Holdings' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Expro Group Holdings' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     Furthermore, it has done a great job growing EPS over the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    In terms of investment risks, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>we've identified 1 warning sign </strong>with Expro Group Holdings</a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Expro Group Holdings' profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.

While revenue is forecast to grow by 2.1% per year, trailing the broader US market's 10.2% pace, earnings are expected to rise sharply at 44.86% per year.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it’s gotten too pricey? Let’s dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco’s new store openings and bold expansion plans.

In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today’s dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco’s intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company’s current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company’s share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry’s average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco’s stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco’s PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco’s case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco’s current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco’s current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio.

A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers—such as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks—to your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company’s real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company also announced an improved dividend outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for OBIC Business Consultants.</a></p> <p>OBIC Business Consultants has picked up strong momentum this year, with a year-to-date share price return of 29.44% and a 1-year total shareholder return of 29.92%. Recent profit growth and an improved dividend forecast have added to the positive sentiment. This suggests investors are rewarding both operational strength and growing income potential.</p> <p>If you’re interested in broadening your search beyond a single software name, now is a great time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>With OBIC Business Consultants delivering robust profit growth and a strong dividend outlook, the question now is whether investors are looking at an undervalued opportunity or if market optimism has already factored in future gains.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 40.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>OBIC Business Consultants currently trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 40.4x, which reflects a premium relative to its closest peers. The last closing price was ¥8,750.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings multiple measures how much investors are willing to pay per yen of company earnings. In software and technology sectors, higher PE ratios sometimes correspond with strong growth prospects, reliable profits, or perceived quality.</p> <p>OBIC Business Consultants is considered good value compared to its peer average PE of 58.8x, suggesting the market recognizes upside relative to other software firms. However, compared to the broader Japanese software industry average of just 21.1x, this multiple is steep. Against our estimated fair PE ratio of 27.6x, the current valuation also appears stretched. This means the market is pricing in significant optimism and future earnings growth that may be above historic norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for OBIC Business Consultants</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 40.4x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower sector growth or a shift in market sentiment could dampen expectations and put pressure on OBIC Business Consultants' premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-4733/obic-business-consultants-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this OBIC Business Consultants narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model</h2> <p>While the PE ratio points to a stretched valuation, the SWS DCF model offers a sharply different perspective.

However, the recent report of weaker subscriber and sales growth questions the strength of this near-term catalyst, and underscores the immediate risk that digital demand may be cooling more quickly than previously expected.\n\nAmong recent company announcements, management confirmed guidance for 8% to 10% total subscription revenue growth and a low double-digit gain in digital advertising revenue. While this optimism highlights confidence in the company’s diversified digital offerings, actual growth will be closely watched by investors given softer recent results.\n\nBut with growing concerns about subscriber churn and pricing power, investors should be aware that ...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nyse-nyt/new-york-times/5f69ymnv-trusted-journalism-and-digital-subscriptions-will-expand-global-reach-ap4l\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on New York Times (it's free!)</a></p><p>New York Times' narrative projects $3.2 billion revenue and $487.8 million earnings by 2028.

Its 1-month share price return sits at 31.8%, with a remarkable 98.9% rise year-to-date. Short-term momentum is clearly building, and the company’s 3-year total shareholder return of 172.9% shows how investor interest can gather pace when exploration milestones suggest deeper value may be unlocked.</p> <p>If you’re keen to expand your shortlist beyond resources, now’s a smart time to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>But with FireFly’s share price already surging following recent drilling results, does the stock still offer value at current levels?

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly’s elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project. Unless rapid progress and commercialisation materialise, such a premium can be hard to sustain.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, negative earnings and reliance on optimistic asset valuations mean that any operational setbacks could quickly pressure FireFly Metals’ premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FireFly Metals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Deep Discount on SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-book ratio suggests FireFly Metals is expensive compared to its industry, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

The company’s full-year outlook is now under review, raising questions about the path forward for this established name in apparel.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Wacoal Holdings.</a></p> <p>Wacoal’s shares have seen modest gains over the past year, with a 2% year-to-date share price return. The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

Momentum has faded recently as investors digest the company’s growth story and consider whether risk perception around the stock is beginning to shift.</p> <p>If you’re looking to spot the next breakout, now is a great moment to expand your investing universe and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares down and fundamentals still showing double-digit growth, investors are left wondering if this dip signals a genuine undervaluation or if the market has already factored in all of Vital Farms’ future prospects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 33.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>Vital Farms' most-followed narrative suggests there is a sizeable gap between its consensus fair value and the recent close price. With the consensus fair value at $52.60 and a last close of $34.89, the stock is viewed as deeply discounted by the narrative’s proponents. This sets the stage for a look at the factors fueling that call.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Significant expansion of farm and production network, including acceleration of CapEx to build out capacity (two production lines at the Seymour, Indiana facility and additional cold storage), positions Vital Farms to fully capitalize on unmet/pent-up demand. This would remove prior supply constraints and unlock further revenue and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Can expansion alone propel Vital Farms to the narrative's ambitious targets? The real twist is in the underlying expectations for outpaced earnings growth, margin leverage, and a premium multiple rarely seen outside high-growth sectors. Uncover which bold assumptions push this price target so far above consensus and what it would take for the fair value case to actually play out.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $52.60 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, heavy capital spending or disappointing demand growth could pressure margins and profits, which could quickly challenge the optimistic valuation narrative for Vital Farms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Vital Farms narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: The Market’s Multiple</h2> <p>Taking a look at valuation through the lens of the price-to-earnings ratio tells a different story. Vital Farms trades at 30.2x earnings, which is above both the US Food industry average of 18.5x and its peer average of 30.7x. Notably, this is also higher than the fair ratio of 23.3x that the market could move toward. This suggests some valuation risk, despite strong fundamentals.

The company’s net profit margin has edged down to 3.8% from last year’s 3.9%, and over the past five years, earnings have declined at an annual rate of 8.2%, with negative earnings growth most recently reported. Investors are weighing the company’s good relative value, highlighted by its Price-to-Earnings ratio of 10.8x against peers and the broader industry, against continued revenue and profit underperformance.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for KomeriLtd.</a> <p>Next up, we will see how these headline numbers stack up against the narratives shaping investor sentiment.

This demonstrates resilience as the broader specialty retail sector faces ongoing cost headwinds.</li> <li>Investor commentary highlights Komeri’s reliable operations and steady cash flows even as industry competition intensifies.\n    <ul> <li>The steady margin performance positions Komeri as a lower-risk, defensive choice. This is especially valued when sector peers have reported steeper margin compression amid inflation.</li> <li>While margin stability is seen as a strength, the modest 0.1 percentage point decline indicates that securing future profitability will depend on ongoing operational improvements, not just defensive positioning.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Discount Signals Underlying Value Debate</h2> <ul> <li>Shares trade at ¥3,200, a 59% premium to the DCF fair value estimate of ¥2,007.03. The company’s P/E of 10.8x is attractively below peers and industry averages.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis points out that while Komeri looks undervalued on earnings compared to competitors, the significant DCF premium raises debate over whether the share price already reflects all its defensive advantages.\n    <ul> <li>This valuation tension spotlights Komeri’s appeal as a “good value” pick for relative P/E shoppers, but leaves room for debate on whether the broader market is overlooking risks tied to lagging growth rates and past earnings declines.</li> <li>Investors weighing value versus growth must reconcile the company’s below-peer P/E and defensive cash generation with the gap to intrinsic value implied by discounted cash flows.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Five-Year Earnings Slide Raises Bar for Improvement</h2> <ul> <li>Earnings have declined by an annual rate of 8.2% over the last five years, and the latest period also saw negative growth. This extends a multi-year pattern of underperformance compared to market averages.</li> <li>Despite commendable cost management, broader market observers caution that continued declines amplify the importance of management executing on digital upgrades and margin stabilization.\n    <ul> <li>Some see Komeri’s steady dividend and focus on operational improvements as important, but argue that these have yet to reverse the entrenched earnings downtrend that positions the company as a “reliable but slow” performer compared to more dynamic peers.</li> <li>With revenue and earnings growth forecasts still trailing the Japanese market, calls for bold execution are growing louder among investors who want evidence that management can deliver a meaningful turnaround.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.
