The 2025 10-K reinforces that story: management is leaning into a diversified deposit base, higher-yielding securities and a thicker capital cushion, with CET1 at 14.10% and shareholders’ equity up 14.4%. That is reassuring given recent volatility in bank funding costs, and it supports the near-term dividend story after the latest increase to US$0.24 per share. At the same time, the filing also puts a spotlight on the weak revenue growth, a 3.1% net interest margin and a greater tilt toward variable-rate loans, which keeps interest rate risk, funding competition and the stock’s above-peer valuation firmly on the list of near-term swing factors.</p> However, investors should not ignore how interest rate sensitivity could pressure margins if conditions shift.\n\nDespite retreating, First Bancorp's shares might still be trading 41% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/18aaef02-f6ad-4640-bf94-5195b7c7866f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$54 to almost US$97 per share, underlining how far apart individual views can be.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today’s terms.</p> <p>For USA Rare Earth, the latest twelve month free cash flow (FCF) is a loss of $39.02 million. Analyst and model projections see FCF running through a mix of negative and positive years, with a projected $735.00 million in FCF for 2030. Beyond the explicit analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends the cash flow path using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.</p> <p>Combining all of those discounted cash flows produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $203.77 per share. When this is compared with the recent share price of $18.90, the model suggests the stock trades at a 90.7% discount to this estimate, which indicates substantial potential upside based solely on these cash flow assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests USA Rare Earth is undervalued by 90.7%.

It is especially common in capital intensive sectors where tangible assets matter.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to support a higher P/B, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower multiple. That is why it helps to look at a company’s P/B next to its sector and peers, rather than in isolation.</p> <p>USA Rare Earth currently trades on a P/B ratio of 68.02x. This sits well above the Metals and Mining industry average P/B of 2.66x and above the peer group average of 8.63x. Simply Wall St also uses a “Fair Ratio”, which is a proprietary estimate of what the P/B should be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, the company’s risks, its industry and its market cap. This Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored anchor than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for those company specific features.</p> <p>On this framework, USA Rare Earth’s current P/B of 68.02x is higher than the Fair Ratio assessment would typically support.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

These are simply your story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins and fair value.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit in the Community page and let you connect USA Rare Earth’s business story to a clear financial forecast, then to a fair value that you can compare with today’s price to help you decide whether it feels more like a buy, a hold or a sell for you.</p> <p>Because Narratives on the platform are updated as new information comes in, such as news or earnings, they stay aligned with the latest data without you needing to rebuild your thinking from scratch every time something changes.</p> <p>For example, one Narrative on USA Rare Earth might see a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future cash flows and margins. Another Narrative might point to a much lower fair value because its author expects more modest revenue and profitability.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for USA Rare Earth? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/USAR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9fa14202-666c-4219-9075-d0fa68ebbcd4/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:USAR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The recent US$2.0 billion-plus equity and preferred recapitalization, and the backlash over dilution, now make capital allocation and governance a key near term catalyst and risk, as investors weigh balance sheet repair against potential pressure on per share earnings.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the late February 2026 equity and preferred offerings, totaling roughly US$475 million in common shares and about US$1.58 billion in preferred and depositary shares, matter most here. The proceeds are earmarked for debt repayment and corporate purposes, directly affecting Whirlpool’s capital structure at a time when its dividend coverage, leverage and profitability are already under scrutiny, and when consensus still expects only modest revenue growth and mid single digit margins.</p> <p>Yet, while recapitalization may support financial flexibility, investors should also be aware of the growing tension between dilution risk and Whirlpool’s ability to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Whirlpool (it's free!)</a></p><p>Whirlpool's narrative projects $15.8 billion revenue and $741.4 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool/a5koavsu-dividend-yield-and-investments-will-counter-competition-and-demographic-pressures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Whirlpool's forecasts yield a $87.67 fair value</a>, a 28% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-whr/whirlpool\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/67dc9682-e1be-411e-a8eb-0d0aa3a0425f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>WHR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>The lowest set of analysts sketches a much more cautious path than consensus, arguing that tightening environmental and recycling rules could push Whirlpool’s already thin margins even lower.

It does not yet appear to alter the key longer term catalyst from policy changes, but it could increase the perceived risk around margins.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, SLM’s recent US$500,000,000 share repurchase authorization stands out. After the stock’s steep pullback, ongoing buybacks and the existing 2.77% dividend signal that management is continuing to return capital even as analysts reassess expense trends and earnings forecasts.

This backdrop helps frame whether the current share price aligns with the fundamentals and the longer term story investors have in mind.</li> <li>On Simply Wall St's valuation checks, Grab Holdings scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-grab/grab-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>, which suggests some measures flag potential undervaluation while others are more cautious.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $50.6 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further to build a 10 year view. Within that, projected free cash flow for 2028 is $1.29 billion, and the discounted values of projected cash flows from 2026 through 2035 range from roughly $728 million to $1.51 billion per year.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $11.34 per share, compared with the recent share price of $4.22. That gap implies the stock is around 62.8% undervalued on this DCF view.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Grab Holdings is undervalued by 62.8%.

You can think of it as a quick check on how the market is weighing the trade off between what the business earns today, the growth investors hope for, and the risks they see.</p> <p>A higher P/E can sometimes reflect stronger growth expectations or lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E can point to the opposite, or simply lower market enthusiasm. For Grab Holdings, the current P/E is 64.57x, compared with the Transportation industry average of 37.54x and a peer group average of 28.08x, so the shares are trading at a higher multiple than both these benchmarks.</p> <p>Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” to estimate what a more suitable P/E could be, given factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks. Because it blends these elements, the Fair Ratio can be a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peers or the broader industry. Grab Holdings has a Fair Ratio of 25.27x, which is well below its current P/E of 64.57x, indicating that the shares are pricing in more optimism than this model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-grab/grab-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:GRAB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/42550d29-9c5a-406d-98f7-4e9293ce901e/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:GRAB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

For example, one investor might see Grab as worth US$8.20 per share based on higher margins and a future P/E of 37.0x, while another might anchor on US$6.65 with different growth and risk assumptions. This gives you two contrasting Narratives you can weigh against the current market price when thinking about your own decisions.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Grab Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/GRAB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nasdaq-grab/grab-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:GRAB 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/42550d29-9c5a-406d-98f7-4e9293ce901e/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:GRAB 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The NZ$46.7 million single gain sits next to underlying net income of NZ$173.4 million in H2 2025 and NZ$103.8 million in H1 2025, so anyone leaning bullish needs to separate that one off item from the recurring profit story.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the 76.7% earnings growth and 37.9% margin can point to the NZ$183.4 million trailing profit, but the one off gain means the underlying run rate is lower than the headline suggests.</li> <li>Critics who highlight profit quality risk can point to the prior 23.5% margin and the NZ$46.7 million gain as reasons to treat the trailing margin and profit with some caution when they compare halves over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue creeps higher while EPS steps up</h2> <ul> <li>Across the last three reported halves, revenue has moved from NZ$217.4 million in H2 2024 to NZ$225.0 million in H1 2025 and NZ$239.7 million in H2 2025, while basic EPS over the same halves came in at NZ$0.0648, NZ$0.0890 and NZ$0.1680 respectively, and the trailing 12 month EPS now sits at NZ$0.2719 on NZ$483.8 million of revenue.</li> <li>Supporters of a more optimistic narrative often point to Port of Tauranga as a core infrastructure style asset, and the combination of steadily higher half year revenues and a five year average earnings growth rate of 9.7% per year fits that story, although the recent 76.7% year over year earnings jump and NZ$46.7 million one off gain mean the latest EPS figures sit above the longer term growth profile.\n    <ul> <li>On the one hand, trailing 12 month revenue of NZ$483.8 million and forecast revenue growth of about 5.3% per year line up with the idea of a business tied to ongoing trade flows.</li> <li>On the other hand, when you compare trailing EPS of NZ$0.2719 and a 76.7% earnings lift to the 9.7% per year five year average, it shows the recent step up is much sharper than the longer trend and partly linked to that one off gain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> To see how this recent revenue and EPS path fits into different long term storylines around the company, it is worth looking at how other investors frame the trade off between steady trade linked volumes and one off gains in their narratives about Port of Tauranga, and weighing those views against the numbers above. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NZSE/POT\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Port of Tauranga.</strong></a> <h2>P/E of 29.9x versus peers</h2> <ul> <li>The current P/E ratio of 29.9x at a share price of NZ$8.05 sits above the global infrastructure industry average of 15.9x and a peer average of 25.7x, while remaining below an alternative infrastructure benchmark of 31.6x and above a DCF fair value of NZ$5.63 that is lower than the current price.</li> <li>Bears who worry about valuation risk see several concrete markers, as the share price of NZ$8.05 is above the NZ$5.63 DCF fair value and the 29.9x P/E is higher than both the 15.9x global infrastructure average and the 25.7x peer average, even though revenue is only forecast to grow about 5.3% per year and earnings by 3.4% per year.\n    <ul> <li>Those valuation comparisons mean the market is assigning a higher multiple than many of the reference groups despite the modest 3.4% forecast earnings growth versus a 16.3% New Zealand market forecast.</li> <li>At the same\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

this margin pressure, arguing that heavier cloud, AI and transaction model costs could keep profitability under strain, and the current data lines up with several of those concerns:\n    <ul> <li>Management has highlighted that the new transaction model and annual billings can temporarily flatter billings and free cash flow, which bears see as a risk if those boosts fade while the trailing net margin is already at 15.6%.</li> <li>They also point out that cloud and AI workloads are expected to weigh on gross margin and that management itself flags potential operating margin headwinds in fiscal 2027, which is consistent with the recent move from 18.1% to 15.6% net margin.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics argue these FY 2026 margins hint at a tougher profit path ahead than the share price implies, and they are watching closely to see if cost and pricing plans can offset cloud and transaction model headwinds. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/sjp874pi-cloud-workflow-friction-and-ai-monetization-delays-will-eventually-support-stronger-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Autodesk Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue And EPS Step Up, But Growth Pace Looks Measured</h2> <ul> <li>Quarterly revenue progressed from US$1,570m in Q3 FY 2025 to US$1,957m in Q4 FY 2026, and basic EPS moved from US$1.28 to US$1.49 over the same Q3 FY 2025 to Q4 FY 2026 comparison, while trailing twelve month EPS edged from US$5.17 to US$5.28.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about expanding cloud and AI driven workflows supporting strong long term demand, yet the recent numbers paint a more measured earnings pace, which creates a gap investors need to watch:\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to grow about 20.3% per year over the next three years, but the latest one year earnings growth rate of 1.1% is well below that figure, so the current run rate has not yet caught up with those expectations.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue is US$7.2b and is forecast to grow 9.6% per year, which is a solid absolute level but slightly below the 10.3% revenue growth forecast for the broader US market, so Autodesk will need its product mix and pricing to work hard to deliver the higher earnings growth that is being modeled.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Mixed Valuation Signals Around A US$245.89 Share Price</h2> <ul> <li>With the stock at US$245.89, it trades on a 46.3x P/E, below a 50x peer average but above the 26.4x US software industry, while a DCF fair value of about US$312.43 and an analyst price target of roughly US$337.33 both sit above the current price.</li> <li>Bulls argue that Autodesk’s position in cloud based AEC and manufacturing workflows, plus AI features, justify that premium P/E and the upside implied by models and targets, and today’s numbers give them some support but also a few checks:\n    <ul> <li>Support comes from the combination of high recurring software revenue, US$7.2b in trailing sales and forecasts for roughly 12% annual revenue growth with earnings expected to reach about US$2.0b by around 2028, which helps explain why models point to DCF fair value above the current share price.</li> <li>The tension is that current net margin is 15.6%, below the 18.1% level a year earlier, while those same bullish assumptions rely on margins rising into the low 20% range over the next few years, so investors need to decide whether today’s margin profile is a temporary step on that path or a sign that the ramp could be slower.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see the gap between the US$245.89 share price and modelled fair values as an opportunity, but these FY 2026 margins and growth rates are exactly what they point to when debating how quickly Autodesk can earn into that premium.\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth,

Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Losses Widen Again To US$49.3 Million In Q4</h2> <ul> <li>Net income from ongoing operations moved from a loss of US$1.3 million in Q1 2025 to a loss of US$49.3 million in Q4 2025, even though quarterly revenue sat in a fairly tight band between US$462.3 million and US$496.7 million over the same period.</li> <li>Critics in the bearish camp focus on this pattern, arguing that a business which is reporting US$1.9b in trailing 12 month revenue but a US$85.5 million trailing loss is still highly exposed to rising medical and pharmacy costs and may need more external funding, and the step up in quarterly losses during 2025 keeps that concern very much alive.\n    <ul> <li>Bears point to the combination of ongoing GAAP losses and a cash runway of under one year as evidence that profitability is not yet resilient even after several years of reported loss reduction.</li> <li>They also highlight that higher benefit expense ratios and elevated utilization, if they continue, would leave limited room to absorb further shocks without either deeper cost cuts or new capital.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are worried about how these Q4 losses fit with the cautious view, it is worth seeing how skeptics frame the longer term picture in their dedicated bear case for the stock: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f7z0cpk1-rising-costs-and-regulation-will-erode-medicare-advantage-profitability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Clover Health Investments Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Trailing US$1.9b Revenue Supports Bullish Scale Story</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Clover Health generated US$1.9b of revenue with a loss of US$85.5 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.17, compared with US$1.4b of trailing revenue and a US$46.3 million loss at the same point a year earlier, so the business today is larger in dollar terms but still loss making.</li> <li>The bullish narrative leans heavily on this growing revenue base, arguing that a 15% trailing growth rate and reported 34.3% annual loss reduction over five years set up a path to profitability as operating leverage from the Medicare Advantage book and the Clover Assistant platform is realized.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point out that analysts expect earnings to turn positive over the coming years and see trailing loss levels as manageable relative to revenue scale, especially if margins move from roughly minus low single digits to positive territory as forecasts suggest.</li> <li>They also note that management and bullish analysts both talk about membership and revenue expansion, and see the current loss run rate of US$85.5 million on US$1.9b of revenue as a thinner gap to close than in earlier years reflected in the five year loss reduction rate.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls argue this revenue base could be the springboard for the kind of margin shift they are expecting, so if you want to see how that story is built out in full, the dedicated bull case narrative is a helpful next stop: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"

Investments Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Cheap P/S Of 0.6x Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Clover Health is currently valued on a P/S of 0.6x compared with an average of 1.3x for the wider US healthcare industry and 1.9x for closer peers, while the current share price of US$2.09 sits against an allowed analyst target reference of US$3.15, which implies potential upside if that target were reached.</li> <li>Where bulls and bears differ is how they weigh that low P/S and potential upside against a cash runway of under one year and ongoing losses, so the same set of numbers can look like a value opportunity or a value trap depending on which risk is viewed as most important.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls see the 0.6x P/S multiple and trailing 15% revenue growth as a sign the stock is priced below other healthcare names relative to its sales, especially if earnings turn positive as some forecasts suggest.</li> <li>Bears counter that a cash runway of less than a year keeps the door open to future capital raises, which could dilute existing holders and limit how much benefit shareholders actually see from any improvement in operations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>This appointment points to Sharplink putting more weight on thought leadership and clearer messaging around its Ethereum focused offering. Having a Head of Research and Communications with a media and research background can help the company explain complex crypto concepts in plain language, which matters if it wants to speak credibly to both retail investors and institutions. For you as an investor, the key question is whether Ehrlich can translate his journalistic experience into consistent, high quality research content that supports Sharplink’s mission of providing what it calls smarter access to the long term Ethereum opportunity. His prior roles suggest he is used to functioning as a public face, so you may see more commentary, reports, and educational output tied directly to Sharplink’s brand. That can influence how the story is framed versus other Ethereum related products in the market, and how comfortable different audiences feel engaging with the company’s tools and data.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ The company has a history of shareholder dilution over the past year, which can weigh on existing holders if equity issuance continues.</li> <li>⚠️ The share price has been more volatile than the broader US market over the past 3 months, which may not suit investors with lower risk tolerance.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts currently expect very large earnings growth, which, if achieved, could reshape how the market views Sharplink’s long term potential.</li> <li>🎁 A communications lead with deep digital asset experience may help Sharplink better articulate its Ethereum focus to both institutional and retail audiences.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Sharplink’s external communication style changes and whether new research output appears that is clearly tied to Ehrlich’s remit. Pay attention to updated investor materials, thought pieces on Ethereum and crypto market structure, and any data products or reports that carry his name. You can also track whether management references this new role on future conference calls or presentations, particularly around how Sharplink plans to grow its retail and institutional user base for Ethereum related access.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Uber Technologies is priced attractively right now, you are not alone. A closer look at its current valuation can help you decide how it fits into your portfolio.</li> <li>Uber shares last closed at US$75.42, with returns of 2.1% over the past 7 days, a 5.5% decline over 30 days, a 9.0% decline year to date, a 0.8% decline over 1 year, a 118.2% gain over 3 years and a 35.8% gain over 5 years.</li> <li>Recent headlines around Uber have continued to focus on its role as a major player in app based mobility and delivery, as well as ongoing debates about ride hailing regulation and the treatment of drivers across key markets. Together, these themes help frame how investors are thinking about Uber's long term business profile and the risks that could be priced into the stock today.</li> <li>On our checks, Uber currently scores a valuation rating of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 6</a>. Next, we will look at how different valuation methods line up on the stock before finishing with a more complete way to put all those signals into context.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_industry_underperformer\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out why Uber Technologies's -0.8% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Uber Technologies Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in your hands right now.</p> <p>For Uber Technologies, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is about $9.79b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates see Free Cash Flow figures in the $10b to $23.56b range over the next decade, with Simply Wall St extending projections beyond the initial analyst window.</p> <p>Pulling all those cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$171.19 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$75.42, this output suggests the stock is 55.9% below that estimated intrinsic value according to this specific set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Uber Technologies is undervalued by 55.9%.

You can think of it as how many dollars investors are currently willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a reasonable P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Uber currently trades on a P/E of 15.44x. That sits below the Transportation industry average of 37.54x and the peer average of 29.00x, which might initially suggest a lower market multiple than many comparable names. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Uber is 23.12x, which is its view of the P/E that could be appropriate given factors such as Uber’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margin, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>The Fair Ratio can be more informative than a straight comparison with peers or broad industry averages because it attempts to adjust for those company specific factors rather than assuming all firms deserve the same multiple. Comparing Uber’s current P/E of 15.44x with the Fair Ratio of 23.12x points to the shares trading below that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UBER P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/57147e6d-cf28-4e13-b807-86a31e002d9b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UBER P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives make those differences transparent and easy to compare so you can see which story aligns most closely with your own view before you act.</p> <p>For Uber Technologies however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Uber Technologies Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/0fpb8nh8-uber-expanding-driverless-rides-will-accelerate-market-leadership-over-rivals?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Uber Technologies Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$104.47 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value versus the last close of US$75.42: about 28%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used in this narrative: 12.93% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on a growing user base across Mobility and Delivery, with cross platform integration and membership products like Uber One aimed at lifting spend per customer and retention.</li> <li>Sees long term earnings power supported by autonomous and electric partnerships, higher margin services such as advertising and loyalty, and ongoing use of AI to improve efficiency.</li> <li>Flags meaningful risks around capital heavy autonomous investments, regulatory and insurance costs, competition in both ride hailing and AVs, and the impact of lower margin products on profitability.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies/9bpnrqjk-uber-expanding-autonomous-ride-hailing-with-waymo?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Uber Technologies Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this cautious narrative: US$72.92 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value versus the last close of US$75.42: about 3%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption used in this narrative: 13.05% per year</p> <ul> <li>Highlights how ride hailing, Uber Eats and freight are all important, but sees intense competition, possible price pressure and market saturation as constraints on profitability.</li> <li>Emphasises ongoing regulatory and legal risks, including driver classification, safety and local operating rules, which could raise costs and limit flexibility.</li> <li>Assumes a higher future P/E multiple of 44.72x, while questioning whether that valuation is justified once the business matures and the market focuses more on sustainable earnings.</li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how your own view compares with these, you can use the full Community Narratives to adjust the revenue, margin and valuation assumptions to match your expectations for Uber and see how your fair value stacks up against the current share price.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Uber Technologies? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UBER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/transportation/nyse-uber/uber-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UBER 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/57147e6d-cf28-4e13-b807-86a31e002d9b/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UBER 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
