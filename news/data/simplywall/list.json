            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>SEACOR Marine Holdings (SMHI) closed FY 2025 with Q4 revenue of US$52.3 million and a basic EPS loss of US$0.57, while the trailing 12 month figures show revenue of US$227.8 million and a basic EPS loss of US$1.06. Over the past six quarters, the company has seen quarterly revenue move between US$52.3 million and US$69.8 million, with EPS ranging from a loss of US$0.94 to a profit of US$0.35. This puts the latest results in the context of uneven profitability and tight margins. For investors, a key consideration after this report is how quickly those margins might firm up enough to support a more durable earnings profile.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-smhi/seacor-marine-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for SEACOR Marine Holdings.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the prevailing narratives around growth, profitability, and risk that many investors have been following.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$172.9 million in Q4 2024 to US$175 million in Q4 2025, while basic EPS shifted from US$0.01 to a loss of US$0.05 over the same period, which keeps margins front and center for investors assessing how much earnings power is being squeezed.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Summit Hotel Properties.</a> <p>With the latest numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the prevailing narratives around growth, profitability, and risk that investors have been debating over the past year.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Summit Hotel Properties</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8ff4a9e8-2e58-4f90-8a6e-f369c26fb1d1/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Trailing 12 months still in loss territory</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Summit booked US$729.5 million in revenue and a net loss of US$23.6 million, with basic EPS of a US$0.22 loss.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about low new hotel supply and recovering travel as supports for stronger RevPAR and margins. However, the trailing loss and negative margins show that, so far, the company is not capturing enough profitability from that backdrop.\n<ul> <li>Revenue over the last 12 months is broadly similar to the US$731.8 million level cited a year earlier, which contrasts with the view that limited new supply should be driving stronger top line momentum.</li> <li>Analysts also expect revenue to grow around 2% a year while the business stays unprofitable, which keeps the consensus claim of improving margins under pressure until the income statement actually moves back into the black.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly EPS losses and the bullish story</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, every quarter showed a basic EPS loss, ranging from a US$0.01 loss in Q2 2025 to a US$0.11 loss in Q3 2025, compared with a small profit of US$0.01 per share in Q4 2024.</li> <li>Bulls point to potential margin expansion and reduced losses over multiple years, but the run of quarterly EPS losses in 2025 sits awkwardly against that. This suggests the bullish view is leaning heavily on future improvements rather than what is currently visible in the reported numbers.\n<ul> <li>For example, Q3 2025 showed revenue of US$177.1 million with a net loss of US$11.5 million, which does not yet reflect the higher margin story bulls are expecting from cost control and capital recycling.</li> <li>Even in Q2 2025, where the loss narrowed to US$1.6 million on US$192.9 million of revenue, the company still did not produce positive EPS, so investors following the bullish view may want to watch whether that quarter proves repeatable or not.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that limited new hotel supply and higher travel demand could be the turning point for Summit, but the current streak of quarterly EPS losses shows exactly why they see more upside if margins start to move their way. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0a1wloca-urbanization-and-hybrid-work-will-boost-premium-hotel-demand-x6j6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Summit Hotel Properties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap vs DCF and bearish concerns</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at US$4.65 compared with a DCF fair value of about US$6.04, and the P/S ratio of 0.7x sits well below the 4.2x average for Global Hotel and Resort REITs.</li> <li>Bears focus on high leverage, weak interest coverage, and forecasts of earnings declining an average 34.6% a year over the next three years. That combination helps explain why the market price stays below the DCF fair value and well under the US$5.63 analyst target, despite the apparently low P/S multiple.\n<ul> <li>Interest payments are described as not well covered by earnings, which fits with the trailing 12 month net loss of US$23.6 million and keeps financing risk front of mind for cautious investors.</li> <li>With revenue only expected to grow around 2% a year, slower than the 10.4% US market forecast, skeptics can argue that a discount to both the 6.04 DCF fair value and the 5.63 target price is not surprising while profitability and coverage ratios look stretched.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that weak interest coverage and ongoing losses could matter more than the apparent valuation discount, which is why many are watching how quickly earnings and cash coverage improve relative to debt costs. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/p77jwp5c-remote-work-pressures-and-demographic-trends-will-undermine-sunbelt-markets-1ksz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Summit Hotel Properties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Summit Hotel Properties on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of risks and potential rewards feels finely balanced, take a closer look at the figures yourself and decide where you stand.

of US$652.5 million and net income of US$21.3 million.</li> <li>Critics highlight that low and contracting margins could cap earnings power, and the margin move from 3.9% to 3.3% lines up with that concern, \n    <ul> <li>the consensus narrative talks about gross margins around the 5% range and the need to grow higher margin solutions and services, which ties directly to this margin squeeze at the net level</li> <li>at the same time, earnings still grew 17.5% over the past year, so the bearish focus on margin pressure has to be weighed against the fact that profits have continued to rise in absolute terms</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears warn that thin margins and integration risk could limit upside even with earnings growth showing up in the latest numbers. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Climb Global Solutions Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>17.5% Earnings Growth Versus Modest Revenue Trend</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew 17.5% while revenue growth is described as modest at about 1.2% per year in the provided context, with trailing twelve month EPS at US$4.71 on revenue of US$652.5 million.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that adding high growth vendors, expanding internationally and investing in automation can support strong and sustained earnings growth, \n    <ul> <li>the 17.5% trailing earnings growth and roughly 25% per year compound earnings growth over five years are consistent with that bullish view on profit expansion</li> <li>however, the modest 1.2% revenue growth versus a 10.4% US market pace shows that top line momentum is slower than the broader market, which is an important counterpoint for that optimistic storyline</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Mixed Signals From P/E And DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>CLMB trades on a 19.1x P/E with a share price of US$90.03, below the US Electronic industry average of 28.3x but above its peer average of 13.5x, and well under a DCF fair value of about US$208.35 and an analyst price target of US$133.00.</li> <li>What stands out in the bullish argument is the gap between current price and value estimates, \n    <ul> <li>supporters can point to the roughly 56.8% difference between the US$90.03 share price and the DCF fair value of about US$208.35 as evidence that the market is not fully reflecting trailing earnings growth of 17.5%</li> <li>yet the fact that CLMB trades richer than peers on P/E at 19.1x versus 13.5x means skeptics can argue that some of that growth is already acknowledged, even if the stock is cheaper than the broader industry and below the US$133.00 analyst target</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls argue that the wide gap to DCF fair value and earnings track record could matter more than the premium to peers. <a

At that time, hardly anyone thought about voice AI. However, over more than two decades, the team accumulated diverse experience with this technology, building a moat of over 280 patents that set it apart from competitors.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Hormel Foods (HRL) opened fiscal Q1 2026 with revenue of about US$3.0 billion and basic EPS of US$0.33, setting a clear snapshot of where the business stands as earnings season gets underway. The company has seen quarterly revenue move in a tight band around US$3.0 billion over the past year, while basic EPS has ranged from a loss of roughly US$0.10 in Q4 2025 to US$0.40 in Q4 2024. This gives investors a mixed but data rich backdrop for judging this quarter. With trailing net profit margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier and earnings forecast to grow faster than revenue, the key question now is how durable Hormel’s margin profile really looks.</p> <a

Income Swings and Margin Pressure</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last six quarters, net income has moved from a loss of US$56.1 million in Q4 2025 to US$181.8 million in Q1 2026, while trailing 12 month profit stands at US$489.4 million on US$12.1b of revenue, aligning with the 4% net margin figure.</li> <li> Bears focus on profitability pressure, and the numbers give them some support alongside some pushback.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing net margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier lines up with concerns about margin compression from volatile input costs like pork, beef, and nuts.</li> <li>At the same time, recent quarterly net income in the US$170 million to US$184 million range across most of the last five quarters, apart from Q4 2025, suggests earnings have remained relatively steady even as longer term margins have tightened.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year Hormel’s margin strain has been a key talking point for skeptics, so this mix of steady recent profits and lower trailing margins makes the bear case more nuanced than a simple profitability decline story. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hormel Foods Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>EPS Stability vs Forecast Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Basic EPS has hovered around US$0.31 to US$0.33 in four of the last five quarters, with a Q4 2025 loss and a Q4 2024 EPS of US$0.40 as the outliers, while earnings are forecast to grow about 11.18% per year compared with roughly 2% revenue growth.</li> <li> The consensus narrative that earnings growth can run ahead of sales growth is tested by this steady but unspectacular EPS pattern.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month EPS of US$0.89 compares with quarterly EPS near US$0.33 in Q1 2026 and Q3 2025, which is below the US$0.40 level seen in Q4 2024 and below earlier trailing EPS figures like US$1.47 a year ago.</li> <li>Forecasts calling for earnings to grow faster than revenue suggest better margins over time, yet today’s trailing 4% net margin and flat recent EPS band show that the margin uplift implied by those forecasts is not visible in the recent history supplied.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rich P/E, Dividend Strain and DCF Upside</h2> <ul> <li>Hormel trades on a trailing P/E of 27.9x versus 24.2x for the broader US Food industry and 13.2x for peers, while offering a 4.71% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings or free cash flow, and a DCF fair value of US$48.41 compared with a current share price of US$24.82.</li> <li> Bulls point to long term earnings growth and valuation upside, and the figures both support and complicate that view.\n    <ul> <li>The stock price of US$24.82 sitting well below the DCF fair value of US$48.41 fits the optimistic claim of meaningful upside if earnings forecasts are met.</li> <li>However, the combination of a premium 27.9x P/E, a 4% trailing net margin, and a dividend that is not well covered means the bullish argument depends heavily on the expected margin improvement and cash generation that are not yet reflected in the trailing data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that richer P/E and stretched dividend against the potential DCF upside, it is worth seeing how bullish investors connect these earnings trends to their long term case for Hormel. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hormel Foods Bull

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth right now.</p> <p>For Astec Industries, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s last twelve months of Free Cash Flow is reported at about $28.24 million. Analysts provide explicit forecasts out to 2027, with Free Cash Flow projected at $82.10 million in that year, and Simply Wall St extends those forecasts further using its own assumptions, out to 2035, keeping everything in dollars and in millions.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today under this model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at about $86.31 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $62.34, the DCF suggests Astec Industries trades at roughly a 27.8% discount, which screens as undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Astec Industries is undervalued by 27.8%.

It is a quick way to see how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risks. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can point to a lower one.</p> <p>Astec Industries currently trades on a P/E of 36.75x. That sits above the Machinery industry average of about 28.70x and below the peer group average of roughly 41.03x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Astec Industries is 30.79x, which is its view of what a reasonable P/E would be after factoring in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the industry, because it adjusts for those business specific characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the actual P/E of 36.75x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 30.79x, Astec Industries appears overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You set out your story for Astec Industries, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and end up with your own Fair Value that you can compare with today’s price on the Community page. This page is used by millions of investors, so your view updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. You can see, for example, one investor building a Narrative that supports a Fair Value of about US$86 per share, while another, more cautious view aligns with a Fair Value closer to US$56.50. Each uses the same company but very different expectations to decide whether the current price looks attractive or not.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Astec Industries? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ASTE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$383.6 million in Q4 2024 to US$490.7 million in Q1 2025, while basic EPS has swung from a small profit of US$0.02 in Q4 2024 to progressively larger quarterly losses through 2025.

That view sits against a five year history where losses widened at roughly 13.2% per year and the latest TTM period still shows US$63.5 million in losses, so the optimistic case leans heavily on a future margin shift that is not visible in these reported numbers.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly losses widened sharply in Q4 2025</h2> <ul> <li>Q4 2025 net income excluding extra items was a loss of US$56.0 million on revenue of US$410.4 million, compared with smaller quarterly losses earlier in 2025 that ranged from about US$0.6 million to US$4.5 million on revenues between US$460.8 million and US$490.7 million.</li> <li>Bears argue that dependence on cyclical equipment demand and large OEM customers could keep earnings under pressure. The pattern in 2025, where quarterly losses moved from roughly US$0.6 million in Q1 to US$56.0 million by Q4 while revenue stayed within a US$410 million to US$491 million band, gives their argument support that profitability has been fragile even without a collapse in the top line.\n    <ul> <li>The data also shows that over the last five years, losses widened at about 13.2% per year, which fits with the cautious view that earnings volatility and operating leverage have worked against shareholders recently.</li> <li>With the share price at US$9.90 and the business still loss making over the last twelve months, skeptics may question how quickly any forecast profit recovery can show through in reported EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bears warn that the latest step up in quarterly losses could signal that tighter OEM spending or cost pressure bites harder than optimistic scenarios assume, especially if order patterns stay uneven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/lubktl12-trade-and-oem-risks-will-delay-recovery-yet-spark-optimism-1mqc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Titan International Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Mixed valuation signals at US$9.90 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The data shows a P/S of 0.3x compared with a peer average of 1.7x and a US Machinery industry average of 2.3x. A DCF fair value of US$7.71 per share sits below the current US$9.90 price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to the low 0.3x P/S multiple and the earnings growth forecasts as backing their case for upside, but the DCF fair value of US$7.71 being below the current share price and the company’s current TTM loss of US$63.5 million mean the market is already pricing in some improvement. That leaves less room for error if revenue growth of 3.7% per year and recent loss trends persist instead of quickly swinging toward the earnings levels implied by an 11.25 analyst target.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus expectations in the data look for revenue growth of 5.5% per year and margins moving from about 1.2% loss making today to a 2.5% profit margin by 2028, so the gap between those future assumptions and today’s US$63.5 million loss is what investors are effectively paying for at US$9.90.</li> <li>If earnings track closer to the more cautious path, where margins are still only 6.0% by 2028 and earnings are US$124.5 million, the current discount to an 11.25 target is smaller than it appears once the DCF fair value of US$7.71 is factored into the range of views.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these valuation signals to their thesis on margins and growth, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Titan International Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Titan International on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the mix of bullish hopes and cautious signals in the numbers, it is worth taking a closer look at the data yourself and moving quickly to shape your own view.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Koppers Holdings (KOP) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$432.7 million and basic EPS of US$1.52, while trailing twelve month figures show revenue of about US$1.9 billion and EPS of US$2.82. Over recent periods, quarterly revenue has ranged from US$456.5 million to US$504.8 million in FY 2025, with basic EPS moving from a loss of US$0.68 in Q1 2025 to US$1.21 in Q3 2025 and US$1.12 in Q3 2024. This sets up a story where modest earnings growth, a 3% net margin and a low trailing P/E sit alongside a history of weaker multi year earnings and a sizeable one off loss that still shapes the margin picture.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-kop/koppers-holdings\"

net margin still relatively thin</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Koppers converted US$1.9b of revenue into US$56 million of net income, which works out to a 3% net margin compared with 2.5% a year earlier.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about long term margin strength from efficiency projects and portfolio clean up, yet the current 3% margin and the US$78.6 million one off loss show that profitability is still sensitive to shocks and not yet at the mid to high teens margin range that bullish investors are hoping for.\n    <ul> <li>Quarterly net income excluding extras moved from a loss of US$13.9 million in Q1 2025 to a profit of US$29.7 million in Q4 2025, which supports the idea of improving operations but also highlights how wide the swing can be.</li> <li>With trailing earnings having declined on average by 17.9% per year over five years, the recent 6.9% earnings growth versus that trend is helpful for the bullish case but not yet a clean break from the longer track record.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that recent margin gains are the first step toward the higher profitability story many are watching for, and they will want to see whether the current 3% net margin can move closer to the levels discussed in their thesis. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Koppers Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Debt coverage still a key weak spot</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts highlight that debt is not well covered by operating cash flow on the trailing 12 months, even though net profit margin ticked up to 3% and earnings rose 6.9% versus the multi year trend.</li> <li>Skeptics focus on this weak debt coverage and the 17.9% annual earnings decline over five years as signs that higher margins alone may not be enough, especially if housing, rail and industrial demand stays soft for longer than the cautious narrative assumes.\n    <ul> <li>The one off loss of US$78.6 million in the last 12 months is a concrete example bears can point to when they argue that unexpected hits can quickly pressure cash flow and limit room to pay down debt.</li> <li>Management targets net leverage of 2x to 3x over time, and the bearish commentary notes that current leverage is above that range, which keeps financing and interest cost risk front and center for more conservative investors.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bears warn that until operating cash flow covers debt more comfortably, any slip in margins or volumes could matter more than the recent 6.9% uptick in trailing earnings. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Koppers Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Low 13x P/E versus peers</h2> <ul> <li>Koppers currently trades on a trailing P/E of 13x, which sits below the peer average of 21x, the US Chemicals industry at 24.4x, and the broader US market at 19.4x.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests long term earnings growth from infrastructure demand, sustainability themes and portfolio reshaping, and the gap between the US$37.24 share price and the US$52.50 analyst target highlights how much of that improvement investors think is not yet reflected in the current 13x multiple.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to reach US$245 million by around September 2028 with EPS of US$11.99, which is a large step up from the US$15.1 million earnings in the latest trailing set, so the current multiple is being weighed against a much higher future profit base in their model.</li> <li>For that target to make sense on their numbers, Koppers would trade at a P/E of 5.3x those 2028 earnings, which is far below the current 24.4x industry level and shows how much of the upside case depends on both earnings growth and the market still applying a modest multiple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\"

Over recent quarters the company has seen revenue move from US$340.1 million in Q1 2024 to US$284 million in Q1 2025, and from US$333.8 million in Q3 2024 to US$333.1 million in Q3 2025. Quarterly EPS has ranged from a US$1.54 loss in Q1 2024 to US$1.31 in Q3 2024 and US$1.12 in Q3 2025, before slipping back into the red in the latest quarter.

Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Trailing losses still weigh on the story</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, Ingevity generated US$1.17b of revenue but reported a net loss of US$150.3 million and basic EPS of US$4.15 loss, so the company is still unprofitable over the full year even though some individual quarters were positive.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view points to a business in transition, with portfolio changes and cost work expected to support more resilient margins over time, yet the current loss profile shows the company is not there yet.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus commentary highlights efforts like divesting lower margin operations and focusing on higher value specialty chemicals as potential support for future margin stability, but the latest trailing numbers still reflect weak earnings quality.</li> <li>The same consensus view references investments in areas such as EV related materials and process purification as future growth drivers, which sit against a starting point of modest revenue growth of about 3.5% per year and sustained losses over the past five years.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue growth modest versus expectations</h2> <ul> <li>Revenue over the last year implies about 3.5% annual growth, compared with a 10.4% growth rate forecast for the wider US market, so Ingevity is growing but at a slower pace than that broader benchmark.</li> <li>Looking at the bullish angle, forecasts for earnings to turn positive and grow very quickly rest on this modest top line, which creates a clear tension.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to analysts expecting profit margins to move from a current level of roughly 16.3% loss to a positive 28.4% in about three years, even though recent quarterly net income excluding extra items ranged from a loss of US$78.8 million in Q4 2025 to a profit of US$47.5 million in Q3 2024.</li> <li>Those same forecasts see earnings reaching US$412.8 million and EPS of US$5.9 by around 2028, which would be a very large swing from the current trailing loss of US$150.3 million and basic EPS of US$4.15 loss, so anyone relying on the bullish case needs to be comfortable with that jump.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, bulls are effectively betting that a modest 3.5% revenue growth path can still support a very large earnings swing, which is a big assumption to weigh. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Ingevity Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation and debt pull in opposite directions</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/S of 2.2x compared with 1.2x for the US Chemicals industry and 1.3x for peers, while a DCF fair value of about US$119.88 per share sits well above the current share price of US$70.52, so simple multiples and the DCF signal send different messages.</li> <li>Bears focus on the combination of high leverage and these richer P/S multiples, arguing that this mix could be a risk if the forecast turnaround does not play out as modeled.\n    <ul> <li>The company has been flagged as having a high level of debt at the same time as trailing earnings remain negative, which leaves less room for error if revenue growth stays around 3.5% a year rather than moving higher.</li> <li>Critics also point to the five year record of losses worsening at about 61.7% per year as a challenge for a cautious view, because it shows that the business has not yet translated its revenue base of roughly US$1.17b a year into consistent positive net income.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> With richer P/S multiples, a high debt load, and a DCF fair value of US$119.88 against a share price of US$70.52, skeptics will likely keep asking how quickly the company can improve profitability to justify both the balance sheet risk and the valuation signals. <a

<li>On the bullish side, the trailing 12 month earnings growth of 60.8% and a 5 year earnings growth rate of 26.2% a year line up with the view that portfolio optimisation and higher value terminals

€46.52.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that this discount sits alongside a reported dividend yield of 3.44%, creating a mix of income and lower P/E that some investors may see as attractive, while others focus on the tension between the current price and the lower DCF fair value.\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the 8.9x P/E and the higher market multiples fits with the idea that the market is pricing in some of the forecast earnings decline rather than treating the recent 60.8% trailing earnings growth as the new normal.</li> <li>At the same time, the DCF fair value of €27.78 being below the €46.52 share price shows that not every valuation lens points to the same conclusion, which is why some investors will cross check multiples against cash flow based approaches.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Forecast earnings decline keeps bears engaged</h2> <ul> <li>Analyst data in the last 12 months flags expected revenue declines of about 2.6% a year and earnings declines of about 16.1% a year over the next three years, even after a strong trailing period where net margin is 41.4% and earnings growth is 60.8%.</li> <li>Bears argue that high debt and exposure to fossil fuel and chemical storage, together with these forecast declines, could pressure cash flows, which aligns with the data showing expected drops in revenue and earnings despite the solid trailing 12 month numbers.\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 41.4% net margin today and forecasts for earnings to fall around 16.1% a year highlights the concern that current profitability sits above what analysts see as sustainable as the business mix shifts and legacy assets mature.</li> <li>High leverage is listed as a risk alongside those forecast declines, so cautious investors will be watching how earnings trends evolve relative to that debt load rather than focusing only on the recent margin strength.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The bearish view leans heavily on those projected declines and the balance sheet risk, so if you want to see exactly how skeptics build their argument from these numbers, it is worth reading the detailed bear case next. <a class=\"company-report-links\"

Over recent periods the company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$986.8 million in Q4 FY 2025 through US$942.1 million and US$1.0 billion to US$1.1 billion and US$1.2 billion before reaching US$1.3 billion, while basic EPS losses ranged between about US$0.86 and US$1.29 per share.

On the West Coast, locking in three full building leases in Redondo Beach with a single domestic energy tenant, plus a long dated lease in Rancho Dominguez with a laboratory products company, gives better visibility on occupancy in key infill logistics submarkets. Terminating an in place lease slightly early to accommodate the new Redondo Beach agreements suggests Terreno is prioritizing tenant profile and lease length over a short period of remaining income from the prior tenant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around the Bronx and Queens projects, where planned demolition, interior build out and reconfiguration need to be finished on time and within the US$12.2m and US$103.4m expected investment levels.</li> <li>⚠️ The US$500m at the market follow on equity program could lead to shareholder dilution if new shares are issued without offsetting benefits in earnings or asset quality.</li> <li>🎁 The Bronx asset carries an estimated stabilized cap rate of 5.3% initially and 6.1% after renovation, while Queens is guided at 5.4%, giving investors concrete return targets for these projects.</li> <li>🎁 Long dated leases in Southern California industrial hubs, including one running to 2036, can support more predictable cash flows if tenants perform as expected under their contracts.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, the key questions are execution and capital deployment. On the leasing side, you can watch how quickly the Rancho Dominguez and Redondo Beach tenants take occupancy, and whether there are any disclosed changes to rent terms or renewal activity. On the acquisitions side, progress updates on permitting, demolition and construction at the Bronx and Queens assets will be important to see if the targeted cap rates and timelines hold. Finally, keep an eye on how much of the US$500m follow on equity capacity Terreno actually uses, and at what share prices, because that will shape the balance between portfolio growth and dilution for existing investors.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Terreno Realty, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/TRNO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Terreno Realty</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Gustavson as its new Chief Accounting Officer.</li> <li>At the same time, Compass International Holdings entered a three-year alliance with Rocket Companies and Redfin that could add more than 500,000 exclusive listings to Redfin’s platform and embed Rocket Mortgage offerings into Compass’s technology, meaningfully expanding listing exposure and integrating financing into its homebuying experience.</li> <li>Next, we’ll examine how this three-year Rocket and Redfin alliance may influence Compass’s investment narrative around its AI-enabled platform.</li> </ul><p>AI is about to change healthcare.

The Rocket and Redfin alliance directly touches the key near term catalyst of platform adoption by expanding Compass’s digital reach, while the biggest current risk remains that structural shifts in how homes are bought and sold could weaken the traditional agent-centric economics Compass depends on.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the three-year alliance with Rocket Companies and Redfin looks most relevant, because it plugs Compass’s listings and Rocket Mortgage financing into high-traffic consumer channels where buyers already search. For shareholders focused on catalysts around AI and integrated services, this agreement may matter as much as quarterly results, since it tests whether Compass’s technology and data can actually convert broader online exposure and lead flow into better economics per transaction.</p> <p>Yet even with these partnerships, investors should be aware that growing regulatory and platform power could still reshape how much value brokerages like Compass are allowed to keep...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Compass (it's free!)</a></p><p>Compass’ narrative projects $9.1 billion revenue and $275.1 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass/0jhpbs6g-ai-integration-and-evolving-demographics-will-expand-real-estate-horizons-tv18\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Compass' forecasts yield a $13.90 fair value</a>, a 39% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1de63fb6-70ab-4048-a072-49ee626a6c2a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COMP 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest ranked analysts were assuming only about 11.6 percent annual revenue growth to roughly US$8.7 billion and modest 1.9 percent margins by 2028, so if you worry that tech platforms could eventually marginalize Compass’s agent model, this new Rocket and Redfin partnership might either soften or reinforce that concern depending on how much value you think flows to Compass versus its partners.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/real-estate-management-and-development/nyse-comp/compass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 5 other fair value estimates on Compass</a> - why the stock might be worth just $11.00!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

Looking back, revenue has moved from €37.5b in the first half of 2024 to €36.3b in the second half and then to €38.1b in the first half of 2025, while basic EPS has shifted from €0.78 to €0.88 and then to €1.16.

This keeps the consensus focus on execution and cost control very relevant.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 18.7x vs peers at 29.4x</h2> <ul> <li>Engie is trading on a P/E of 18.7x, below both the peer average of 29.4x and the Global Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.1x, with a current share price of €29.53.</li> <li>Supporters of the more bullish arguments see this lower P/E and the DCF fair value gap as a valuation opportunity, but the earnings and margin profile keep that view grounded in some clear trade offs:\n    <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of €43.90 sits well above the current €29.53 share price, and trailing 12 month net income of €3.8b with basic EPS of €1.52 shows the business is profitable. This heavily supports the idea that the stock is not priced like its estimated cash flows.</li> <li>However, forecast earnings growth of about 6% per year and revenue growth of about 2.4% per year, both slower than the French market figures cited, plus a 5.3% net margin slightly below 5.5% last year, give bulls less of a growth argument and more of a value argument based on today’s multiples.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic investors connect this valuation gap to Engie’s long term projects, check out the dedicated bull case for more context on where they think the upside could come from. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Engie Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>5.01% dividend with weak coverage</h2> <ul> <li>Engie’s dividend yield is 5.01%, but dividend payments are described as not well covered by free cash flow, and interest payments are not well covered by earnings, even though trailing 12 month net income is €3.8b.</li> <li>Critics in the more bearish camp focus on these payout and financing pressures, and the numbers here line up closely with those concerns:\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 5.3% net margin and weak interest coverage means a meaningful chunk of profit is already spoken for by financing costs. This supports the bearish view that higher leverage could limit flexibility if conditions get tougher.</li> <li>On top of that, the 5.01% yield not being well backed by free cash flow fits the worry that, even with net income of €2.8b in H1 2025 and €3.8b over the last 12 months, cash generation may not comfortably fund both dividends and planned investments at the same time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that 5.01% yield against the balance sheet strains, it is worth reading how skeptics frame the downside risks before you decide where you stand. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Engie Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tn3mpuws-engi-renewable-projects-and-power-agreements-will-offset-valuation-risks-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Engie on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Reading these numbers you can probably see both the appeal and the worry, so do not wait too long to check the full picture for yourself.

Over recent periods the company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$435.2 million to US$503.4 million while basic EPS stayed in loss making territory between US$0.23 and US$0.70 per share.
