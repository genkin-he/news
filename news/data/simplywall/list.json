The company has seen quarterly revenue move from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025, alongside EPS shifting from C$0.49 to C$0.95 over the same period. This sets up an earnings picture where recent quarterly profitability contrasts with a loss making trailing 12 month base. For investors, the mix of positive Q4 earnings on top of loss making full year figures keeps the spotlight firmly on how margins hold up from here.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-npi/northland-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Northland Power.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up against the key narratives around Northland Power's profitability, growth potential, and risk profile that investors have been talking about.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n65x0uiq-grid-storage-and-offshore-wind-will-deliver-a-brighter-future-uxos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Northland Power</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-npi/northland-power-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:NPI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb1e3ff3-ac2f-404c-899f-e4a48d235412/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:NPI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Loss making over C$160 million on a 12 month view</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Northland Power recorded total revenue of about C$2.4b and a net loss of C$163.2 million, which contrasts with Q4 alone showing net income of C$249.5 million.</li> <li>What stands out for the bearish narrative is that this 12 month loss comes after multiple loss making quarters, including Q3 2025 net loss of C$414.0 million and Q2 2025 net loss of C$64.1 million. Critics argue this keeps cash flow and long term earnings visibility under pressure even as individual quarters like Q4 look strong.\n    <ul> <li>Bears also point to weak coverage of interest costs and dividends, with earnings currently not covering a 3.32% dividend yield or interest expense. This ties directly into concerns about elevated debt and C$9b already spent plus C$6b still expected on Baltic Power and Hai Long.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus commentary about step changes in EBITDA from new offshore wind and storage projects is hard to reconcile with the recent pattern of trailing losses, including a trailing loss of C$285.9 million just one quarter earlier in Q3 2025.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Northland’s recent loss pattern and debt funded build out give cautious investors plenty to question in the more optimistic forecasts of future earnings power. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Northland Power Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Slow 1.7% revenue growth versus wider market</h2> <ul> <li>Over the past 12 months, revenue has grown by about 1.7% per year compared to a 6.1% per year forecast for the Canadian market, even though quarterly revenue moved from C$582.3 million in Q4 2024 to C$725.3 million in Q4 2025.</li> <li>Analysts' bullish case leans heavily on new projects like Hai Long and Baltic Power and on grid scale storage, arguing that these additions can lift margins from about 2.3% loss making levels today toward 16.5% over three years. However, the current modest 1.7% revenue growth rate and history of wind resource issues and curtailments in places like the German offshore assets show how sensitive actual revenue can be to weather and power price conditions.\n    <ul> <li>On the supportive side for bulls, Q4 2025 revenue of C$725.3 million and net income of C$249.5 million follow Q4 2024 revenue of C$582.3 million and net income of C$126.8 million, which aligns with the view that new assets and better contract mix can improve earnings in stronger periods.</li> <li>Against that, the same 12 month data set still shows the business unprofitable and dropping several onshore and battery projects in Ontario, Alberta, and New York. This pushes back on the idea that growth from here is straightforward or that all pipeline projects will translate into higher revenue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> For investors weighing that slower 1.7% revenue growth against the big project pipeline, it helps to see how others frame the trade off between new capacity, weather risk, and contract quality. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Northland Power Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation sits below both DCF fair value and peers</h2> <ul> <li>At a current share price of C$21.69, Northland Power trades below the DCF fair value of about C$23.78 and at a P/S of 2.3x, compared with 3.0x for the broader North American renewable energy industry and 3.5x for peers.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that expansion into grid scale storage and offshore wind and the use of long term, inflation linked contracts could justify these lower multiples over time. Yet the combination of a trailing loss of C$163.2 million and interest expenses that are not well covered by earnings means the current discount can also be read as the market pricing in balance sheet risk and a reliance on analyst forecasts that expect earnings of C$454.1 million by around 2028.\n    <ul> <li>The spread between the share price of C$21.69 and DCF fair value of C$23.78, plus a forecast earnings growth rate of about 40% per year and an analyst target of C$22.42, are the main numbers backing the view that the shares are not expensive\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/n65x0uiq-grid-storage-and-offshore-wind-will-deliver-a-brighter-future-uxos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Northland Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With bulls and bears both making strong cases here, it is worth getting familiar with the full set of numbers and forming your own view quickly.

Trailing 12 month figures show revenue of about US$2.2 billion and a basic EPS loss of US$4.27, keeping the story firmly in loss-making territory. Over recent periods the company has seen revenue move from US$475.2 million in Q4 2024 to US$596.4 million in Q4 2025. This has come alongside quarterly EPS that has swung between a profit of US$0.20 in Q1 2025 and a loss of US$7.29 in Q2 2025, so investors are watching how quickly that volatility settles into more

roughly US$1.0b, so this is a business with strong top line scale that is still firmly in loss making territory.</li> <li>What stands out for the bullish narrative is that analysts are pairing this 30.7% revenue growth over the last year with forecast earnings growth of about 116.54% per year,\n    <ul> <li>Revenue moving from US$1.7b to about US$2.2b over the last 12 months aligns with the bullish view that digital banking adoption and higher value products like MyPay and Chime Card can support future growth.</li> <li>At the same time, the current trailing 12 month loss of roughly US$1.0b is a reminder that the optimistic margin assumptions in the bullish case depend on a significant shift from today’s loss making base.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some bulls argue this mix of US$2.2b in revenue and heavy current losses could be the setup for a sharp earnings swing if their margin expectations play out, but they are starting from a very loss heavy year.</p> <a

target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Chime Financial Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Quarterly Profit Swings Highlight Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, net income ranged from a profit of US$12.9 million in Q1 to a loss of US$923.4 million in Q2, with Q3 and Q4 losses of US$54.7 million and US$44.8 million, so profitability has moved around a lot within a single year.</li> <li>Bears focus on this pattern when they question how smooth the road to profitability might be,\n    <ul> <li>The very large loss in Q2 2025, alongside much smaller losses in Q3 and Q4, supports the cautious narrative that scaling products like MyPay and instant loans could expose Chime to earnings volatility if credit costs or operating expenses spike again.</li> <li>Even with revenue between US$518.7 million and US$596.4 million across the 2025 quarters, the shift from a small profit in Q1 to sizable losses later in the year gives skeptics concrete data to reference when they argue that earnings quality is still unproven.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptical investors often point to the jump from a US$12.9 million profit to a US$923.4 million loss within the same year as a key reason to treat any profitability timelines with caution.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

dollar of Chime’s sales at a clear premium to its reference group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative ties that higher multiple to expectations for faster growth,\n    <ul> <li>Forecast revenue growth of 16.7% per year compared with 10.4% for the broader US market is one reason investors may be comfortable paying more than peers for each dollar of current revenue.</li> <li>At the same time, the

That supports the idea that profitability, not just top line, is doing more of the work.\n    <ul> <li>Bulls point to wind service and new wind farms as key earnings drivers, and the move from NOK927.6m to NOK1.4b in trailing net income over the last six reported periods is consistent with that stronger earnings story.</li> <li>At the same time, operational issues mentioned in the bearish narrative, like downtime at certain wind farms and lower power prices in Sweden, are not yet visible in these full year margin and earnings figures.

In this dataset, earnings are forecast to decline about 10.8% per year over the next three years and revenue is expected to grow around 0.5% per year versus 3.9% for the wider Norwegian market.</li> <li>Skeptics highlight that a low P/E can be a value signal or a warning, and the bearish narrative leans on those forward numbers to argue that the multiple is low because the market is already factoring in slower growth.\n    <ul> <li>The contrast between 24.8% trailing earnings growth and the expected 10.8% annual decline is exactly the kind of swing bears focus on when they say recent profits may not be a good guide to the next few years.</li> <li>With the share price at NOK260 and analysts in this dataset expecting earnings to shrink while margins ease from 9.4% to 8.2% in the bearish case, the gap between strong recent profitability and softer forecasts is central to that cautious stance.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that the combination of a low P/E and projected earnings declines can sometimes signal a value trap rather than a bargain, which is why they lean more heavily on the forward numbers than the trailing growth. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/id87qqn3-higher-borrowing-costs-and-supply-disruptions-will-strangle-wind-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Bonheur Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>DCF fair value of NOK87.02 vs NOK260 price</h2> <ul> <li>The DCF fair value in this dataset is NOK87.02 per share, compared with the current share price of NOK260 and an allowed analyst price target of NOK306.00. This sets up a wide range of views on what the business may be worth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative thinking tries to balance this by pointing out that while analysts expect earnings to reach about NOK957.7m by 2028 with margins easing to 7.6%, they are still using a 14.1x P/E on those earnings to justify targets closer to NOK306.00, which sits well above the DCF fair value but below very aggressive bullish assumptions.\n    <ul> <li>The fact that trailing earnings sit at NOK1.4b, above that NOK957.7m 2028 estimate, helps explain why a cash flow model might point to NOK87.02, while a multiple based on today’s 7.8x P/E and analysts’ future 14.1x assumption can support higher targets.</li> <li>For you as an investor, the tension between a DCF number far below the market price, a market P/E well below peers and an analyst target at NOK306.00 highlights how sensitive valuation is to which metric you trust most.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jq8q31gd-floating-wind-and-renewables-will-drive-demand-despite-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bonheur on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious views leaves you unsure, quickly review the numbers yourself and weigh both sides using <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/capital-goods/ob-bonhr/bonheur-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Bonheur's low 7.8x P/E alongside forecasts for annual earnings declines of about 10.8% and lower future margins suggests the current profit story may be fragile.</p> <p>If that mix of weaker earnings expectations and a wide gap between DCF fair value and the share price worries you, check out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">231 high quality undervalued stocks</a> that pair stronger fundamentals with prices that look more grounded in their cash flow profiles.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is reported at about $1.45b. Analyst estimates feed into a series of annual free cash flow projections, with Simply Wall St extending these beyond the usual analyst horizon. By 2030, projected free cash flow is $3.43b, with intermediate years between 2026 and 2035 ranging from about $2.74b to just over $4.02b before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model suggests an intrinsic value of roughly $121.45 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $85.33, this implies a 29.7% discount, so the stock screens as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests eBay is undervalued by 29.7%.

It ties directly to what the business is generating today, which is usually easier to interpret than revenue or book value alone.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" or \"fair\" P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower P/E.</p> <p>eBay currently trades on a P/E of 19.15x. That sits very close to the Multiline Retail industry average P/E of 19.65x, and well below the peer group average of 38.59x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 19.82x, which is the P/E it would expect for eBay after factoring in elements like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more useful than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the mix of growth, risk and profitability that is specific to eBay. With the current P/E of 19.15x sitting close to the Fair Ratio of 19.82x, the shares look roughly in line with what this model suggests.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/49564d7c-274f-452b-8679-0ec89f77ad9a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:EBAY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You can also see exactly what revenue growth, margins, P/E and discount rate each view is using.</p> <p>Because each Narrative compares its fair value to eBay’s current price and automatically refreshes when new news or earnings data are added, you can quickly see whether your story still justifies buying more, trimming, or simply watching from the sidelines, without having to rebuild your model every time something changes.</p> <p>For eBay however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading eBay Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties together revenue, margins, valuation assumptions and risks into a single, consistent story so you can decide which feels closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/wyqsf8vq-ai-and-live-commerce-will-empower-sustainable-recommerce-xa2e?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 eBay Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$102.00</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 16.4% below</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 7.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on eBay building a leading global recommerce platform in areas like collectibles, fashion and live commerce, supported by AI tools, enhanced payments and managed shipping.</li> <li>Assumes revenue of about US$13.1b and earnings of about US$2.5b by 2028, with profit margins easing slightly and the shares trading on a future P/E of 20.4x, slightly above today but still below the current US Multiline Retail average.</li> <li>Highlights potential upside from stronger network effects, higher margin revenue streams and ongoing buybacks, while flagging risks such as powerful competitors, dependence on focus categories, regulation and the challenge of attracting younger users.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nasdaq-ebay/ebay/7yo5adcu-overvalued-marketplace-will-suffer-from-digital-disruption-ywf9?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 eBay Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: about US$69.62</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value: 22.6% above</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 3.77% per year</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes tougher competition from big tech ecosystems and social commerce platforms, together with changing demographics, as headwinds for user growth, engagement and gross merchandise volume.</li> <li>Uses revenue of about US$11.8b and earnings of about US$2.1b by 2028, along with lower profit margins and a future P/E of 18.14x, with the view that current market expectations could be too optimistic at recent prices.</li> <li>Points to regulatory costs, logistics limitations and pressure on take rates as constraints, and also notes potential support from advertising, AI tools, enthusiast buyers and capital returns if these factors develop more favorably than expected.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these Narratives frame a reasonable range of possible outcomes using the same building blocks shown in the DCF and P/E checks. This allows you to adjust the numbers, lean closer to the bull or bear case, and decide where eBay fits in your portfolio.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Over recent periods, the company has seen quarterly revenue move from SEK705.48m and EPS of SEK1.25 in Q4 2024 to SEK1,035.30m and EPS of SEK3.41 in Q4 2025. This has occurred against a backdrop of trailing twelve month earnings growth of 91.7% and revenue growth forecasts of about 11.2% a year.

Profit growth over the last 12 months has therefore been much faster than the revenue pace implied by the forecasts.</li> <li>What stands out for a bullish view is how this profit profile lines up with the business story. Trailing net margin is 9.7% versus 7.7% a year earlier, and five year average annual earnings growth is 30%. Together these figures suggest past profitability has scaled faster than the forecast 9.6% annual earnings growth now being used as the reference point.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on recurring wellness demand may point to FY 2025 quarterly net income moving from SEK55.9m in Q1 to SEK123.6m in Q4 as evidence that the model can produce higher absolute profits than a year ago.</li> <li>At the same time, the 11.2% revenue growth forecast sets a more moderate bar than the recent 91.7% earnings growth. This gives bulls and cautious investors very different reference points when they think about how repeatable these margins might be.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Margins at 9.7% put profitability in focus</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing twelve month net income of SEK324.3m on SEK3.3b of revenue implies a 9.7% net margin, compared with 7.7% in the prior year period. A larger share of each krona of sales is therefore currently dropping to the bottom line than a year earlier.</li> <li>For investors who worry on the bearish side about direct sales models being fragile, the margin and EPS pattern creates some useful context. Trailing EPS reached SEK8.95, while FY 2025 quarterly EPS moved from around SEK1.61 in Q1 to SEK3.41 in Q4, which suggests that recent profitability has been achieved with consistent positive earnings across the last six reported quarters.\n    <ul> <li>Critics who question earnings durability still have to weigh that concern against the fact that trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% margin are both well above the Swedish market revenue growth forecast of roughly 0.9% a year cited in the data.</li> <li>At the same time, the forecast earnings growth rate of about 9.6% annually is described as modest, so bears may point out that the step up from a 7.7% to 9.7% margin could prove harder to repeat if the business reverts closer to those forecast growth rates.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E of 17.9x and DCF value of SEK358.99 create a valuation gap</h2> <ul> <li>With the shares at SEK152.00, Zinzino trades on a trailing P/E of 17.9x, compared with a European retail distributors industry average of 13.2x and a DCF fair value in the data of SEK358.99. The shares are therefore priced above the industry multiple but well below that modelled value.</li> <li>What is interesting for a general market view is how those valuation markers sit beside the fundamentals. The company combines a 2.63% dividend yield with trailing earnings growth of 91.7% and a 9.7% net margin, which leaves investors deciding whether the premium to the industry P/E and higher recent share price volatility versus the Swedish market are adequately balanced by the gap between SEK152.00 and the SEK358.99 DCF fair value estimate.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on that DCF fair value may argue that paying 17.9x earnings for a business with five year average annual earnings growth of 30% and forecast revenue growth above the Swedish market is still reasonable.</li> <li>More cautious investors could instead highlight the higher P/E versus the industry average and the recent volatility as reasons to be careful about leaning too heavily on any single valuation model when interpreting the current share price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Beneath these headline figures there is a broader story about how different investors are weighing growth, risk, and valuation, so if you want to see how others are connecting the dots, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/OM/ZZ%20B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Zinzino.</strong></a> </p><h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

With TSE:7011 linked to defense platforms and space systems, new headlines about export control risks are prompting investors to reassess where these activities fit within the broader business mix. For you as a shareholder, the key issue is how any additional compliance requirements could affect contracts, timelines, and capital allocation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the main questions center on how MHI adapts its defense and space operations to evolving Japanese policy and international regulations. Investors are likely to track management commentary on export controls, the composition of the order book, and any changes to risk management, as these factors can shape sentiment toward TSE:7011 even before any financial effects are quantified.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7011/mitsubishi-heavy-industries-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

However, the data also show forecast revenue growth of about 5.6% per year, which is below the cited 7.6% annual revenue growth that bullish analysts are assuming, so the current run rate does not fully back the more optimistic revenue path.</li> </ul> <h2>Margins Sit At 9.1% While Costs Rise</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, TJX is reported to have a 9.1% net margin, compared with 8.6% previously, on trailing revenue of US$60.4b and net income of about US$5.5b.</li> <li>Bears focus on headwinds like wage inflation and foreign exchange, and the guidance that unfavorable FX is expected to trim consolidated sales growth by 1% and EPS growth by 3% fits that concern. Yet the actual trailing margin at 9.1% is already within the 9.2% margin level that bearish analysts build into their 2028 case, which suggests recent profitability is not far from what the cautious view is assuming several years out.\n    <ul> <li>Incremental wage and payroll costs and a projected 10 to 20 basis point drag on pretax margin from FX are exactly the kind of pressures bearish narratives highlight.</li> <li>At the same time, the reported margin improvement from 8.6% to 9.1% indicates those pressures have not prevented TJX from operating at a higher profitability level in the recent period.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how these cost pressures and margin numbers fit into a fuller cautionary story, skeptics have laid out their case in detail here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/m062sds2-fx-and-china-tariffs-will-test-performance-despite-global-expansion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 TJX Companies Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Premium P/E Versus DCF And Targets</h2> <ul> <li>TJX is shown trading on a 31.5x trailing P/E at a share price of US$155.82, with a DCF fair value of US$102.20 and an analyst price target reference of US$167.88, so the stock sits above the modeled cash flow estimate but below that target level.</li> <li>Bulls argue that strong multi year earnings expansion, including 13% earnings growth over the last year and a five year average of 20.5% per year, justifies paying this premium multiple. However, the same data set also shows forecast earnings growth of about 6.48% per year and revenue growth around 5.6% per year, which is slower than broad US market forecasts and makes the 31.5x P/E and the gap to the US Specialty Retail industry average P/E of 20.1x a key tension point for the bullish case.\n    <ul> <li>The trailing 9.1% net margin and history of earnings growth support the idea of a high quality business, which bullish narratives lean on when they point to higher future margins.</li> <li>However, the fact that the current market price is above the DCF fair value of US$102.20 while growth forecasts are closer to mid single digits challenges the idea that quality alone explains the premium valuation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls who think TJX deserves that kind of premium multiple can see how the optimistic story is built around these numbers here: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 TJX Companies Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cs5hz7a2-global-store-openings-and-e-commerce-investment-will-unlock-opportunities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for TJX Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this combination of bullish and cautious views leaves you undecided, now may be a good time to review the numbers yourself and determine your own position.

dividend yield, which backs the view that cash generation has been solid enough to support regular payouts.</li> <li>At the same time, the one off US$317.9m loss in the last 12 months shows that even

relative to other retail REITs can point straight to that gap.</li> <li>On the other hand, a DCF fair value of US$100.37 and a price target of US$65.25 compared with a US$65.99 share price mean valuation signals are mixed rather than uniformly stretched, which does not cleanly match a simple overvaluation claim.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing whether that 58.2x P/E is justified

Case</strong></a><br/> <h2>Interest Coverage And One Off Loss Stand Out</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, earnings of US$1.1b on revenue of US$5.8b came alongside a US$317.9m one off loss and flagged weak interest coverage, where interest payments are not well covered by earnings.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights both resilient rent collections and growing international exposure, and the latest figures give you a way to test how balanced that really is:\n    <ul> <li>Net profit margin at 18.4% and trailing earnings growth of 24.8% over the past year support the idea that the core portfolio is still producing healthy profits relative to revenue.</li> <li>Yet, the large US$317.9m one off loss and the warning that interest expense is not well covered by earnings underline that the capital structure is a key watchpoint, especially as Realty Income increases its European exposure and potentially adds more debt to fund deals.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next

The goal is to estimate what the business might be worth per share at present.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flow projections in $. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $106 million. Analysts and internal estimates project annual free cash flow rising to $513.3 million by 2035, with specific forecast points such as $288.4 million in 2026 and $391 million in 2029. Simply Wall St notes that analysts typically provide up to 5 years of estimates, and the later years are extrapolated within the model.</p> <p>Bringing all those projected cash flows back to today, the DCF produces an estimated intrinsic value of $63.24 per share, compared with the recent share price of C$62.66. That difference suggests the stock is approximately 0.9% undervalued, which is a very small gap.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>OR Royalties is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations or risk levels are more modest.</p> <p>OR Royalties currently trades on a P/E of 41.68x. That is higher than both the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 22.52x and the peer average of 24.97x. On the surface, that suggests the market is paying a richer price for each dollar of OR Royalties' earnings compared with many sector peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for OR Royalties is 20.33x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E could be, given the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. Because it blends these factors, the Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peer or industry averages. With the current P/E of 41.68x sitting well above the Fair Ratio of 20.33x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Here you attach a clear story about OR Royalties to your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, link that story to a financial forecast and a Fair Value, compare that Fair Value to the current price to decide whether the stock looks attractive or not, and then see it update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. For example, one investor might build a more cautious OR Royalties Narrative that aligns with a Fair Value of about C$52.24, while another might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to C$80.37, each reflecting different views on how projects progress, margins develop and what P/E the market is likely to accept.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, here are previews of two leading OR Royalties Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/2p5htw37-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OR Royalties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$80.37</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 22% below this bullish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 30.30% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp model faster growth in royalty volumes from Canadian Malartic, Odyssey Underground and other Tier 1 assets, supported by a mix of gold and growing silver exposure.</li> <li>The narrative focuses on a debt free balance sheet and roughly US$1b of available liquidity to support new royalty and streaming deals that could influence revenue and free cash flow per share.</li> <li>To line up with this view, you would need to be comfortable with earnings rising to US$337.1m by 2028, higher profit margins near 62.5% and a P/E of about 41.3x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/8vp0ahtl-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 OR Royalties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$52.24</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 20% above this bearish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 21.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>This view highlights execution risk at assets such as Canadian Malartic, Dalgaranga and CSA, where timelines, recoveries and mine planning could influence how quickly additional gold equivalent ounces reach OR Royalties.</li> <li>It also considers the possibility that new deals arrive more slowly if management keeps a tight filter on pricing and contract quality in a competitive royalty market.</li> <li>To agree with this stance, you would need to assume earnings of about US$281.0m by 2029, margins around 63.6% and a lower, but still elevated, P/E of about 31.8x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p>These two Narratives show how different assumptions about growth, project execution and valuation multiples can lead to very different fair values for the same stock. The key is to decide which set of assumptions aligns more closely with your own view of OR Royalties and its royalty portfolio.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OR Royalties? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/OR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as relatively resilient, and a lower P/E when they see more risk or slower growth.</p> <p>Linde currently trades on a P/E of 34.41x. That sits above the broader Chemicals industry average P/E of 24.38x and below the peer group average of 40.17x. Simply comparing with peers or the industry gives you a rough sense of how the market is pricing Linde, but it does not adjust for the company’s specific earnings growth profile, profit margins, size or risk.</p> <p>To address that, Simply Wall St estimates a “Fair Ratio” for Linde of 28.92x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth, its industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk profile. Because it is tailored to the company, this Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the sector. With the current P/E of 34.41x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 28.92x, the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St this comes through Narratives, where you set out your own story for Linde, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price. All of this is available within an easy tool on the Community page that updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive.

The company has seen revenue move from €5.1b and EPS of €0.49 in H2 2024 to €5.3b and EPS of €0.63 in H1 2025, compared with a prior H1 2024 reference point of €5.4b in revenue and EPS of €0.69.

The margin lift from 1.6% to 1.8% partly lines up with that, yet the latest half year still shows net income of €90 million on €5.3b of revenue, which is a slim margin, so the bullish view relies on this recent margin level being a base, not a peak.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about margin expansion from around 1.5% to 3.5% over several years, while the trailing 1.8% margin shows some progress but is still far from that 3.5% figure.</li> <li>H1 FY 2025 net income of €90 million is below the €100 million from H1 FY 2024, so the short term pattern does not yet fully match the stronger and more resilient earnings path bulls are hoping for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth look like early support for the bullish story, but the gap between a 1.8% margin today and much higher targets keeps the bull case very dependent on future execution that is not yet in the half year numbers. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/j0gp2vpb-global-electric-adoption-will-expand-connected-vehicle-ecosystems-x1jh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OPmobility Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation Gap Versus €39.56 DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at €17.63 with a trailing P/E of 13.6x, while the provided DCF fair value is €39.56, which is 55.4% above the current price, and the P/E sits above a 12.2x peer average but below the 14x wider European Auto Components group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that the market might be baking in ambitious growth and margin gains. The tension shows up here, because the wide gap between €17.63 and the €39.56 DCF fair value looks supportive for optimists, yet the higher P/E than peers and analyst price target level of €17.94 both suggest other investors are more cautious than that DCF implies.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to rise to €291.9 million by around 2028 with margins moving from roughly 1.5% to 2.7%, but the current trailing earnings base of €185 million and 1.8% margin means that uplift still needs to come through.</li> <li>The consensus target of €17.94 is only slightly above the current €17.63 price and well below the €39.56 DCF fair value, which shows how differently the cash flow model and analyst targets are treating future growth and risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Debt And Dividend Track Record Under Bear Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Risk flags highlight a high level of debt and an unstable dividend history, alongside relatively modest forecast revenue growth of about 2% per year versus a 5.6% market benchmark, even as trailing earnings grew 8.8% and 5 year earnings growth is cited at 16.9% per year.</li> <li>Bears focus on the combination of debt, legacy product exposure and pressure from EV and ESG shifts, and the numbers give them some support, because modest revenue growth expectations alongside that debt profile and an uneven dividend record can limit flexibility if conditions stay tough, even though recent earnings growth and margin improvement mean the company is not matching the more severe earnings pressure that a very bearish view might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 15.1% per year contrasts with only 2% revenue growth, which fits with a bear concern that cost cutting and mix, rather than broad based top line growth, are doing a lot of the work.</li> <li>The unstable dividend and leverage risk do not show up directly in the half year income statement, yet they sit in the background when you weigh how sustainable a 1.8% margin and 8.8% earnings growth might be if the auto cycle or regulation turns less helpful.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are weighing those balance sheet and revenue risks against</p>Next Steps\n<p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/trzoo1aa-analysts-raise-opmobility-price-target-citing-stable-margins-and-improved-risk-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OPmobility on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of optimism and concern feels finely balanced, now is a good time to look through the numbers yourself and stress test your view.

The story is still binary around clinical and regulatory milestones, especially the upcoming EXPLORE-OSA and EXPLORE-CKD readouts and the planned NDA filing. The new US$113.58 million shelf registration tied to ESOP-related shares looks more like financial housekeeping than a major shift in the thesis, but it does underscore the likelihood of further equity usage in a company that is pre-revenue, unprofitable, and not expected to reach profitability in the near term. In the short run, the main catalysts and risks still hinge on lorundrostat data quality, regulatory feedback and future capital raises.</p> However, investors should also weigh the risk of further dilution alongside these clinical milestones.\n\nMineralys Therapeutics' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-mlys/mineralys-therapeutics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bbd189de-48d6-4798-a6f0-f98a74374c70/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MLYS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$41 million to a very large US$413 million, reflecting sharply different expectations for Mineralys’ potential.

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>The Nvidia-led cybersecurity partnership puts Siemens closer to the core of AI-powered protection for industrial automation, where operational technology has historically been harder to secure than traditional IT. By embedding AI security directly into control systems, Siemens is tying its automation hardware and software more tightly to Nvidia’s data processing units and to partners like Palo Alto Networks and Forescout. For you as an investor, this points to deeper integration across the product stack and potentially stickier customer relationships, especially in sectors such as utilities, transport and advanced manufacturing. On the energy side, Siemens’ presence in controlled environment agriculture and microgrids links its grid, controls and digital offerings to areas where reliability and efficiency are central buying criteria. Taken together, these moves position the company alongside peers such as Schneider Electric, ABB and GE Vernova in key areas of industrial digitalization and power resilience. The partnership approach also helps Siemens stay connected to AI and cybersecurity advances without carrying all the development risk alone.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Siemens Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The AI-powered cybersecurity collaboration directly supports the narrative’s focus on industrial AI and digital automation as drivers of recurring, higher margin software and services revenue.</li> <li>Greater reliance on partners and complex industrial AI stacks could increase execution and integration risk, which lines up with concerns in the narrative about large technology transitions weighing on profitability if rollouts are slower or more costly than expected.</li> <li>The emphasis on controlled environment agriculture and microgrids extends Siemens’ role in electrification and data center adjacent energy infrastructure, which is only partially reflected in the existing focus on hyperscaler demand and grid solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/awgw458i-analysts-debate-siemens-growth-and-valuation-amid-modest-fair-value-increase\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Siemens</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Integrating AI-driven cybersecurity into industrial automation and coordinating with multiple partners may increase execution complexity and the risk of cost overruns on large projects.</li> <li>⚠️ Expanding in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture exposes Siemens to policy, subsidy and project funding risks in newer segments, alongside existing concerns that the company has a high level of debt.</li> <li>🎁 The AI cybersecurity partnership and microgrid offerings aim at markets where Siemens already supplies automation, grid equipment and digital tools, which can support cross selling and longer customer relationships.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts highlight several strengths including value, profit and revenue growth and a reliable dividend, which provide context as Siemens targets growing markets such as industrial AI, microgrids and controlled environment agriculture.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track how quickly Siemens and Nvidia translate their AI cybersecurity plans into commercial deployments across factories, grids and transport systems, and whether customers adopt embedded security as standard in new automation projects. In energy infrastructure, watch for contract wins in microgrids and controlled environment agriculture, especially where Siemens can bundle power distribution, control systems and digital monitoring. It is also worth keeping an eye on how these initiatives show up in Siemens’ order intake mix and whether management commentary links them to recurring software or service revenue, compared with more traditional equipment sales.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Siemens, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/XTRA/SIE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Siemens</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This suggests strong longer term momentum despite some shorter term pullbacks.</p> <p>If this geothermal update has you thinking about where power infrastructure is heading next, it could be worth scanning <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">24 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a> as a starting point for other ideas.</p> <p>With Ormat trading at US$117.06, sitting below an average analyst price target of US$130.40 and carrying a recent 72.4% 1 year total return, you have to ask: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 9% Undervalued</h2> <p>Ormat Technologies’ most followed narrative pegs fair value at about $128.60, comfortably above the last close of $117.06. This frames the current move after earnings and new PPAs in valuation terms, not just short term price action.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Extension of production and investment tax credits (PTC/ITC) for geothermal and energy storage projects through at least 2033 reduces capital costs, de risks new project development, and boosts net margins and earnings over the next decade.</em></p> <p><em>Elevated demand for reliable, carbon free baseload power driven by electrification trends (including data centers and industrial customers) is translating into premium power purchase agreement (PPA) pricing, supporting improved revenue visibility and margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/poywhurj-analysts-lift-ormat-technologies-price-target-following-expansion-moves-and-improved-valuation-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to see what kind of revenue path and profitability this narrative is baking in?

That is above the global renewable energy industry at 16.5x, above peers at 40.6x, and well above a fair ratio of 22.9x.
