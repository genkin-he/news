This points to a near-balanced view on valuation, with a slight upside according to popular assumptions. Here is one of the pivotal arguments supporting this outlook:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The rollout and completion of major LNG export projects (ECA Phase 1 nearing completion, Port Arthur Phase 1 advancing, and strong commercial momentum for Phase 2) positions Sempra to benefit from sustained global demand for U.S. LNG as a transition fuel, significantly increasing future cash flows and long-term revenue generation.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/uhdym875-analysts-lift-sempra-price-target-as-margins-improve-and-long-term-eps-guidance-reaffirmed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious how such ambitious projects shape this valuation story?

You’re not the only one asking these questions right now.\n  </li> <li> After a 4.3% pop over the last 30 days, PepsiCo’s shares have still logged a -8.7% return over the past year. This has made for a bumpy ride and is drawing plenty of attention from value-focused investors.\n  </li> <li> Recent headlines highlight PepsiCo’s push into healthier products and big sustainability investments.

This approach aims to reveal what PepsiCo might truly be worth, based on how much money it is expected to generate over time.</p> <p>For PepsiCo, the most recent twelve months of Free Cash Flow came in at $6.4 Billion. Analysts forecast consistent growth, projecting Free Cash Flow to reach $11.4 Billion by the end of 2027. Looking further out, using Simply Wall St’s extrapolations, PepsiCo’s Free Cash Flow could rise to nearly $15 Billion by 2035. These figures reflect a steady upward trajectory in the company’s ability to generate cash, with analysts directly estimating the first five years and later years forecasted using trend-based calculations.</p> <p>The resulting intrinsic value from this DCF analysis is $223.84 per share. Based on the current share price, this represents a 34.7% discount, suggesting that PepsiCo stock is significantly undervalued by the market right now.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PepsiCo is undervalued by 34.7%.

Because earnings are the direct result of a company’s operations, comparing a company’s stock price to its earnings provides investors with a simple gauge of how much they’re paying for each dollar of profit.</p> <p>However, not all PE ratios should be treated equally. What counts as a “fair” PE ratio depends on several factors, including a company’s expected earnings growth, the risks it faces, and overall market conditions. Fast-growing or lower-risk companies often deserve a higher PE, while slower-growing or riskier businesses tend to trade at lower multiples.</p> <p>PepsiCo’s current PE ratio stands at 27.7x. This is above the average for the Beverage industry, which is 17.3x, and higher than the average for its peers at 25.3x. While these comparisons offer some context, Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” takes things further. The Fair Ratio for PepsiCo, calculated at 29.3x, quantifies the PE you’d expect for a stock with PepsiCo’s unique combination of growth prospects, risk profile, profit margin, market cap, and sector. This delivers a more tailored and meaningful benchmark than generic industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Because PepsiCo’s actual PE ratio of 27.7x is quite close to its Fair Ratio of 29.3x, the stock looks to be valued about right by the market at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PepsiCo Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is the story you, as an investor, tell about PepsiCo based on your view of its future. This story combines your forecasts for revenue, profit margins, or growth with your own sense of what the company’s fair value should be.</p> <p>Narratives bridge the gap between hard numbers and real-world context. They help you connect the company’s business story, such as new markets, product launches, or emerging risks, to a tailored financial forecast so you can decide what PepsiCo is truly worth to you. Narratives are easy to use and accessible right on Simply Wall St’s Community page, trusted by millions of investors. They allow you to anchor your investment decision around your assumptions. For example, when the Narrative’s fair value you set is above the current price, the stock could be a buy, and vice versa.</p> <p>What’s unique is that as new information comes in, such as a quarterly result, a major news announcement, or a shift in consumer trends, Narratives automatically update to reflect the latest data instantly. For example, among PepsiCo Narratives shared by investors, the most optimistic currently sees fair value above $160 per share driven by global expansion and digitalization, while the most cautious pegs it near $115 based on slower health product uptake and margin pressures.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for PepsiCo? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-pep/pepsico/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/6e619119-02b5-478e-b119-cd604b0e6f1c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PEP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Recent leadership changes and missed forecasts have fueled intense risk aversion, erasing much of the stock’s prior gains and dragging its year-to-date share price return to negative 66%. Over the last year, shareholders have endured a total return loss of roughly 65%, and multi-year performance shows meaningful underperformance.

Shares currently trade at €7.26, notably below an internally estimated fair value of €16.05, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.6x, much lower than its peers and the wider European industry.

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a <em>base</em> of capital employed that's also declining.  This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking.

If current liabilities hadn't increased as much as they did, the ROCE could actually be even lower.   And with current liabilities at these levels, suppliers or short-term creditors are effectively funding a large part of the business, which can introduce some risks.     </p> <h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> In short, lower returns and decreasing amounts capital employed in the business doesn't fill us with confidence.      Unsurprisingly then, the stock has dived 88% over the last  five years, so investors are recognizing these changes and don't like the company's prospects.

We note the stock price is up 1.7% in the last seven days.      </p><p> With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  We note that for First International Bank of Israel the TSR over the last 5 years was 281%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> First International Bank of Israel shareholders are up 47% for the year (even including dividends).  But that was short of the market average.    On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 31% over half a decade  This suggests the company might be improving over time.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

That means that even when the share price was higher than kr18.76 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares.   Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.    </p> <p> Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid kr151m for 7.95m shares.  On the other hand they divested 5.73k shares, for kr135k.     In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).</a> </p> <h2> Insider Ownership Of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria </h2><p> For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders.  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.   Insiders own 29% of Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria shares, worth about kr596m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria Tell Us? </h2><p> It is good to see recent purchasing.    And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence.   However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious.     When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Gruvaktiebolaget Viscaria insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low.  Nice!      While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin.  We can see that <strong>Formula Systems (1985) Ltd.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TLV:FORTY</a>) does use debt in its business.

Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing.  However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders.  Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> What Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2025 Formula Systems (1985) had debt of US$501.7m, up from US$472.7m in one year.    On the flip side, it has US$406.2m in cash leading to net debt of about US$95.5m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/386267-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798420891\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:FORTY Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is Formula Systems (1985)'s Balance Sheet? </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Formula Systems (1985) had liabilities of US$1.19b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$540.9m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had US$406.2m in cash and US$883.2m in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it has liabilities totalling US$444.8m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, Formula Systems (1985) has a  market capitalization of US$2.24b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Formula Systems (1985) </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). </p> <p> Formula Systems (1985)'s net debt is only 0.30 times its EBITDA.  And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 15.1 times over.  So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt.        Also good is that Formula Systems (1985) grew its EBIT at 12% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt.       The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Formula Systems (1985) will need earnings to service that debt.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow.    Over the most recent three years, Formula Systems (1985) recorded free cash flow worth 67% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax.  This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> The good news is that Formula Systems (1985)'s demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler.   And that's just the beginning of the good news since its net debt to EBITDA is also very heartening.      Zooming out, Formula Systems (1985) seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us.  After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.    <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/software/tase-forty/formula-systems-1985-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 1 warning sign </strong> with Formula Systems (1985) </a>, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.   </p> <p> If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/27012/net-cash-stocks-with-a-growth-track-record\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our list of net cash growth stocks</a> without delay. </p></div>",

Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. </p> <h2> How Much Debt Does NEPON Carry? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NEPON had debt of JP¥1.76b at the end of June 2025, a reduction from JP¥1.95b over a year.    However, it does have JP¥790.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about JP¥972.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883647-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761798465515\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TSE:7985 Debt to Equity History October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look At NEPON's Liabilities </h2><p> Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NEPON had liabilities of JP¥2.46b due within 12 months and liabilities of JP¥995.0m due beyond that.    Offsetting this, it had JP¥790.0m in cash and JP¥1.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by JP¥1.11b.   </p><p> This is a mountain of leverage  relative to its  market capitalization of JP¥1.40b.  Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for NEPON </a></span></p> <p> We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short).  Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses. </p> <p> While we wouldn't worry about NEPON's net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.7, we think its super-low interest cover of 1.8 times is a sign of high leverage.   It seems that the business incurs large depreciation and amortisation charges, so maybe its debt load is heavier than it would first appear, since EBITDA is arguably a generous measure of earnings.   So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately.       One redeeming factor for NEPON is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of JP¥44m, over the last twelve months.     When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start.  But it is NEPON's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future.  So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/capital-goods/tse-7985/nepon-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for an interactive snapshot</a>. </p><p> Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it.   So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow.    Over the last year, NEPON recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect.  That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> Neither NEPON's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its net debt to EBITDA gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt.   But its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience.       Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think NEPON's debt poses some risks to the business.  So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here.    The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Lachish Industries currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching this positive performance.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> It hasn't been the best quarter for <strong>Victory Securities (Holdings) Company Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HKG:8540</a>) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 28% in that time.    But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years).  In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 321%. Impressive!  So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> During the last half decade, Victory Securities (Holdings) became profitable.   Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.  </p><p> You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/hk/diversified-financials/hkg-8540/victory-securities-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/571934952-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798870461\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">SEHK:8540 Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.

The latest quarterly update confirmed steady revenue growth and highlighted continued investment in AI, but also revealed a meaningful dip in net income, making profitability trends the most important near-term catalyst, with wage and margin pressures remaining the top risk. On balance, recent news does not fundamentally alter these priorities, but keeps the spotlight on execution and margin sustainability.\n</p> <p> Among Cognizant’s recent announcements, the expanded partnership with Rubrik to provide Business Resilience-as-a-Service is especially relevant. As AI adoption broadens and clients’ operational risks rise, offerings that directly address data integrity and continuity could help Cognizant shift more business toward high-value, recurring revenue streams, supporting both the company’s growth catalysts and its focus on resilient margins.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be especially aware of ongoing wage inflation and staffing retention pressures, as these could quickly weigh on margins if AI-driven productivity gains do not keep pace with costs...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/software/nasdaq-ctsh/cognizant-technology-solutions/u8hfi0xz-large-deal-wins-and-ai-will-drive-momentum-despite-visa-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Cognizant Technology Solutions (it's free!)</a></p><p>Cognizant Technology Solutions is projected to reach $23.5 billion in revenue and $2.9 billion in earnings by 2028.

This signals the market currently values its earnings at a discount.</p> <p>The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings and is a key metric for oil and gas companies, whose profits can fluctuate materially with commodity cycles. A lower P/E may reveal the market expects slower earnings growth or heightened volatility ahead.</p> <p>Compared to the Canadian Oil and Gas industry average P/E of 12.4x and the broader peer average of 12.1x, Headwater Exploration’s ratio stands out as relatively cheap. It is also almost aligned with its estimated fair price-to-earnings ratio of 9.6x.

This marks a major swing highlighting the forecasted shift from losses to meaningful profitability.\n  </li> <li> According to the analysts' consensus view, this margin improvement is set against the backdrop of projected earnings growth to $19.8 million and EPS of $0.54 by September 2028.\n    <ul> <li>This turnaround is anticipated to be powered by steady revenue gains and cost control, helping net operating income outpace the pace of acquisition-related expenses.</li> <li>Margin guidance assumes disciplined capital management continues, with no major shocks from tenant transitions or unexpected G&amp;A inflation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Consensus narrative notes that a focus on secondary and tertiary markets, where leasing activity and property demand support higher occupancy, should help both margin expansion and long-term stability for shareholder returns.\n    <ul> <li>Maintaining above-average occupancy and smooth operator transitions are key consensus factors meant to underpin revenue and dividend growth in the years ahead.</li> </ul> See why analysts believe CHCT’s margin forecast could be a game-changer for the narrative: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Community Healthcare Trust Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Reliance on Capital Recycling Adds Execution Risk</h2> <ul> <li> One risk flagged in filings is that CHCT is funding planned $146 million of acquisitions by recycling capital from asset sales, rather than tapping equity or additional debt. Any delay or discount on asset sales could directly limit portfolio expansion and future earnings growth.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative highlights that this reliance on disciplined capital recycling over new borrowing is intended to optimize capital deployment now that interest rates are elevated, but\n    <ul> <li>Persistent dependence on asset sales brings execution risk, especially if proceeds fall short or are delayed, potentially impacting accretion to earnings and funds available for dividends.</li> <li>The current environment makes it harder to source quality acquisitions with attractive yields, intensifying the need to get capital cycling exactly right for growth to materialize as forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Gap: DCF Fair Value Versus Peer Discounts</h2> <ul> <li> Shares trade at $14.43, markedly below the DCF fair value of $59.85, and CHCT’s price-to-sales ratio of 3.3x sits below the US Health Care REITs industry average (4.8x) yet above that of its closest peers (2.7x), showing mixed signals for value-focused investors.\n  </li> <li> Analysts' consensus view points to the 17.9 price target, which is 20.9% above current levels, but flags that for this valuation to hold up, CHCT must reach $148.8 million in revenues and a forward PE ratio of 33.7x by 2028. This trajectory is only justifiable if margin and capital allocation assumptions prove accurate.\n    <ul> <li>The wide spread between fair value, analyst targets, and peer multiples creates both opportunity and skepticism. Value seekers are betting on a sustained turnaround, while doubters point to financial position and execution risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/f8ckkhoj-dividend-strength-and-ffo-resilience-will-support-outperformance-despite-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Community Healthcare Trust on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own take on these results?

Beyond the analyst forecast window, cash flows are further projected by extrapolation, reaching estimates as high as $189.8 million by 2035, according to industry growth rates and Simply Wall St methodology.</p> <p>By discounting these future cash flows to their present value, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $16.81 per share. With the share price currently trading at a substantial 56.4% discount to this intrinsic value, the stock appears considerably undervalued based on its future cash flow potential.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Semrush Holdings is undervalued by 56.4%.

The P/S ratio allows investors to assess how much they are paying for each dollar of the company’s sales. This makes it particularly useful for growth-oriented businesses and for firms reinvesting profits back into expansion.</p> <p>Typically, higher growth expectations and lower risk profiles justify higher P/S multiples. Companies facing headwinds or with slower growth should trade at a lower P/S. Benchmarks help provide context but should not be the only consideration in determining a fair value for a stock.</p> <p>Currently, Semrush Holdings trades at a P/S ratio of 2.63x. This is below both the industry average of 5.24x and the peer average of 3.05x, suggesting the stock is trading at a discount relative to comparable software companies. However, Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” for Semrush is calculated at 5.07x. The Fair Ratio is a proprietary metric that reflects not just industry and peer multiples but also incorporates Semrush’s earnings growth prospects, industry dynamics, profit margins, company size, and specific risk factors. This holistic approach provides a more tailored benchmark than simple peer or sector comparisons.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 5.07x with the company’s current 2.63x P/S reveals a meaningful gap. This indicates that Semrush Holdings could be substantially undervalued at present levels based on this comprehensive framework.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1380 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Semrush Holdings Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there's an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a short, structured way for you to clearly state your view on a company, describing the story behind its numbers and what you believe about its future revenue, earnings, margins, and ultimately its fair value.</p> <p>Unlike traditional valuation models, Narratives connect your perspective on Semrush Holdings’s business outlook directly to a financial forecast and a justifiable fair value. This makes it much easier to see <em>why</em> a company might be worth more (or less) than the current share price. Anyone can build a Narrative in minutes on Simply Wall St’s Community page, a platform used by millions of investors worldwide.</p> <p>Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by comparing your personal Fair Value (driven by your story, not just the default numbers) to the current market price, and they automatically update as new reports or news emerge. This keeps your investment view relevant and informed at all times.</p> <p>For example, some investors believe Semrush Holdings will unlock significant growth through AI-powered enterprise solutions, projecting a fair value above $13.00. Others remain cautious about competitive pressures and tighter marketing budgets, putting their fair value closer to $9.00.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Semrush Holdings? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-semr/semrush-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ea1498cd-82af-446b-851a-9bbea9898ae1/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:SEMR Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
