            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Sherwin-Williams (SHW) posted a net profit margin of 11%, just below last year’s 11.1%, pointing to robust but stable profitability. Over the last five years, the company has grown earnings at a 7.5% annual rate, and forward-looking estimates peg earnings expansion at 8.9% per year, which is slower than the broader US market's expected 15.6% annual pace. Revenue is projected to climb 4.3% annually, which also trails the national benchmark. Notably, the most recent year’s earnings growth of 0.6% came in below the company’s five-year average. While the ongoing record of profit growth stands out, investors face a premium-priced stock, as Sherwin-Williams trades at 33.1x earnings, well above both industry and peer averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-shw/sherwin-williams\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Sherwin-Williams.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers under the microscope, comparing Sherwin-Williams’ results to the most widely held narratives in the market.

This comes despite long-term value on display in a strong 81.4% three-year total shareholder return.

This suggests upside to revenue as volumes recover from temporary disruptions. Ongoing investments in technology, AI, and data analytics are driving structural cost reductions through improved operational efficiency and enhanced clinical outcomes. Management expects these measures to support margin improvement even in periods of flat or negative volume growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/426oo7xg-aging-population-and-ai-will-reshape-dialysis-care-yr9j\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what assumptions back this bold price target?

Despite upbeat sentiment around the company's innovation, the 7-day share price return was positive. However, year-to-date movement and the 90-day share price return both indicate that momentum is still fading.</p> <p>If OneStream’s latest AI push has you thinking bigger, it may be the perfect time to broaden your investing search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Given OneStream’s expanding AI ambitions and current discounts to analyst price targets, should investors view recent share declines as an undervaluation?

This sets the table for a deeper look into the justifications behind an optimistic view on future growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing large-scale digital transformation across industries, with CFOs increasingly seeking unified platforms to replace legacy financial systems, strongly positions OneStream to capture expanding market share, supporting sustained subscription revenue and new customer growth. Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts. This is positioning OneStream's cloud-native Intelligent Finance Platform for higher recurring and ratable revenues and contributing to predictable top-line expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jcg9s894-digital-transformation-and-cloud-adoption-will-fuel-market-opportunities-czbv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know what’s fueling such a big fair value gap?

While there were no major headlines driving movement, investors continue to weigh the homebuilder’s recent performance and broader housing sector sentiment.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-kbh/kb-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for KB Home.</a></p> <p>After strong gains earlier in the year, momentum for KB Home has been mixed, with shares up about 13% over the past 90 days but still posting a one-year total shareholder return of -18.7%. This suggests investors are weighing near-term housing headwinds against the company’s longer-term track record. The company continues to maintain multi-year total returns well above the sector norm.</p> <p>If you’re curious where else opportunity might be building, now is a great time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>This raises an important question for investors: Is KB Home currently trading at an attractive valuation given its long-term record, or has the market already factored in all future growth prospects?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3% Undervalued</h2> <p>Compared to its recent close at $62.71, the most popular narrative puts KB Home's fair value at $64.67.

The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso.

With shares closing last session at $94.04, this figure signals the market is assigning no premium to the business’s net assets in its current loss-making state.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio helps investors gauge whether a stock is valued above or below the value of its stated net assets. For Qnity Electronics, a 0% ratio shows that the company's liabilities completely offset its assets, reflecting a period of unprofitability and minimal tangible book value. In fast-evolving sectors like semiconductors, this can suggest the market is either discounting near-term risks or expecting a turnaround to take time.</p> <p>This dynamic raises the question: has the market already baked in all pessimism regarding future growth, or is there hidden value if profits rebound?</p> <p>Comparing to the broader semiconductor industry, Qnity Electronics’ price-to-book of 0% is exceptionally low. Most peers trade at a positive multiple, so this stands out as a warning signal for now. Without additional fair ratio benchmarks, it is difficult to project what level the market could move toward if fundamentals improve.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nyse-q.wi/qnity-electronics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 0% (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, limited transparency on growth drivers and continued losses could continue to weigh on sentiment.

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat. While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant. This EUR 60 million investment is central to Metsä Board’s strategy of boosting product quality and supporting its transition to fossil-free production, underscoring the company’s push for cost efficiency and alignment with long-term sustainability trends that underpin revenue recovery prospects.\n</p> <p> But with European demand still sluggish and restructuring ongoing, investors should be mindful that even well-executed upgrades cannot fully offset...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fi/materials/hel-metsb/metsa-board-oyj-shares/pd0x5y6d-cost-efficiency-and-fiber-packaging-will-drive-long-term-success-dfbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Metsä Board Oyj (it's free!)</a></p><p>Metsä Board Oyj’s narrative projects €2.1 billion revenue and €124.4 million earnings by 2028.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives.
