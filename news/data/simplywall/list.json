Dive into our detailed financial health analysis.</a></p> <p>The lawsuits around ENTRA1 hit the core of how NuScale plans to turn its Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved small modular reactor design into actual projects. Plaintiffs claim NuScale entrusted commercialization and large capital commitments to a partner with no meaningful nuclear track record, while paying ENTRA1 about US$495 million tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority agreement. That sits next to a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million on sales of US$31.48 million and a new US$1b at the market equity offering filing, so legal uncertainty is landing at the same time as heavy cash usage and potential dilution. The recent Romanian approval shows the technology is still finding willing counterparties, but Fluor’s intention to exit and multiple law firms pursuing securities cases add questions around governance and disclosure. For you as an investor, the key issue is whether project partners, regulators and capital providers remain comfortable backing NuScale while these claims work through the courts, which can take years and could involve settlements, higher costs or tighter oversight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The NuScale Power Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The Romanian SMR project approval aligns with the narrative that NuScale’s NRC certified design and partnerships can eventually support commercial deployment and potential future revenue from projects like RoPower.</li> <li>The ENTRA1 focused lawsuits directly challenge the narrative’s reliance on that partner to drive commercialization and funding, and highlight that this dependency could be a key execution weak point.</li> <li>The size and structure of the ENTRA1 payments, along with the follow on US$1b equity filing, may not be fully captured in earlier narrative assumptions about funding sources and cash runway.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/64bqs928-smr-landmark-us-nuclear-agreement-will-shape-commercialization-path-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for NuScale Power</a> to help decide what it is worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Multiple securities class actions focused on ENTRA1 disclosures could lead to legal costs, management distraction and potential settlements.</li> <li>⚠️ A US$1b follow on equity program, very large ENTRA1 related expenses and Fluor’s planned exit all point to dilution and funding risk that analysts have already flagged.</li> <li>🎁 NuScale holds NRC design approval in an SMR field that includes peers such as TerraPower and GE Hitachi, which supports its position when pitching long term baseload power to utilities and data center customers.</li> <li>🎁 The Romanian SMR investment decision and work with the Tennessee Valley Authority show that there is institutional interest in NuScale’s technology for future nuclear capacity.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, any updates on the ENTRA1 related lawsuits, including motions to dismiss, settlements or regulatory follow up, because these will shape potential financial and disclosure consequences. Second, NuScale’s cash burn, use of the US$1b equity program and any changes in project timing in future results, as the company reported a full year 2025 net loss of US$355.79 million. Third, progress on concrete delivery milestones at the Romanian plant and with the TVA partnership compared with other SMR efforts from players such as Rolls Royce and GE Hitachi. Together, those signals will indicate whether NuScale can keep moving from engineering work to funded projects while managing legal and financing pressures.</p> <p>To stay up to date on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for NuScale Power, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/SMR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for NuScale Power</a> to follow the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new omnibus shelf registration mainly strengthens financial flexibility and does not materially change the near term story, where the key catalyst is execution in higher value services and the biggest risk remains margin pressure from hardware mix, competitive pricing, and any slowdown in public sector and education budgets.</p> <p>The most relevant recent update alongside the shelf filing is CDW’s strong Q4 2025 results, with revenue up 6.3% year on year and earnings ahead of expectations. That print reinforced the catalyst of expanding higher margin services and AI related projects, but also highlighted how expense growth and softer margins can cap earnings progress, which matters when the company now has broader tools available to raise capital and fund its IT solutions ambitions.</p> <p>Yet while CDW’s growth themes are appealing, investors should also be aware of how tariff shifts and hardware led margin pressure could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nasdaq-cdw/cdw/201b8sgs-healthcare-and-commercial-gains-will-drive-earnings-momentum-amid-education-weakness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on CDW (it's free!)</a></p><p>CDW's narrative projects $24.3 billion revenue and $1.3 billion earnings by 2028.

This caps off a trailing twelve month profile that includes revenue of US$247.1 million and basic EPS of US$0.51 alongside reported earnings growth of 179.5% over the past year. The company has seen revenue rise from US$49.5 million in Q4 2024 to US$68.8 million in Q4 2025, while quarterly EPS has moved from US$0.11 to US$0.18.

data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>3.1% net margin on US$247.1 million TTM revenue</h2> <ul> <li>Over the trailing twelve months, TWFG generated US$247.1 million in revenue and US$7.7 million in net income, which works out to a 3.1% net margin compared with 1.3% in the prior year period cited in the analysis.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about profit margins rising over time, and the current 3.1% margin gives a concrete starting point:\n    <ul> <li>Analysts referencing this view are working from trailing net income of US$7.7 million on US$247.1 million of revenue, so any future margin expansion would build from this base rather than from the earlier 1.3% level.</li> <li>The contrast between the current single digit margin and the higher margin levels discussed in the narratives makes it easier for you to see how much improvement those scenarios are assuming compared with today.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>TTM EPS moves from loss to US$0.51</h2> <ul> <li>The trailing twelve month EPS moved from a loss of US$0.14 at the start of the period to a positive US$0.51, alongside trailing net income moving from a loss of US$2.5 million to a profit of US$7.7 million in the latest data point.</li> <li>Bulls point to this swing back into profit as evidence that the business model is gaining traction, and the numbers give that argument some support but also set a high bar:\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about earnings reaching US$70.0 million in a few years, while the latest trailing net income in the dataset is US$7.7 million, so the company would need a very large increase in absolute earnings from here to match that view.</li> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 61.8% a year and past TTM growth of about 179.5% highlight how much of the bullish case depends on this recent rebound being repeated or sustained over multiple years.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how optimistic investors connect this recent swing in EPS to their long term story for the stock, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"

TWFG Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E of 37.6x versus DCF fair value of US$4.75</h2> <ul> <li>TWFG is trading on a P/E of 37.6x compared with a cited US Insurance industry average of 12.5x and a peer average of 17.6x, while a DCF fair value of US$4.75 sits well below the current share price of US$19.20 and the analyst price target of US$31.57.</li> <li>Critics use this gap to argue the stock price already bakes in a lot of good news, and the valuation numbers give that cautious view some clear anchors:\n    <ul> <li>The DCF fair value of US$4.75 is materially below both the current share price and the analyst target, which supports the bearish claim that cash flow based estimates are less generous than the market and the TTM growth figures.</li> <li>The current 37.6x P/E being roughly 3x the industry average and more than double the peer average ties into the concern that investors are paying a premium for the 61.8% forecast earnings growth and 18.3% forecast revenue growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who focus on those richer valuation multiples and the lower DCF fair value may find the more cautious take on the stock helpful in framing their own expectations,

The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$172.9 million in Q4 2024 to US$175 million in Q4 2025, while basic EPS shifted from US$0.01 to a loss of US$0.05 over the same period, which keeps margins front and center for investors assessing how much earnings power is being squeezed.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Summit Hotel Properties.</a> <p>With the latest numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the prevailing narratives around growth, profitability, and risk that investors have been debating over the past year.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Summit Hotel Properties</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-inn/summit-hotel-properties/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8ff4a9e8-2e58-4f90-8a6e-f369c26fb1d1/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:INN Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Trailing 12 months still in loss territory</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis to Q4 2025, Summit booked US$729.5 million in revenue and a net loss of US$23.6 million, with basic EPS of a US$0.22 loss.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about low new hotel supply and recovering travel as supports for stronger RevPAR and margins. However, the trailing loss and negative margins show that, so far, the company is not capturing enough profitability from that backdrop.\n<ul> <li>Revenue over the last 12 months is broadly similar to the US$731.8 million level cited a year earlier, which contrasts with the view that limited new supply should be driving stronger top line momentum.</li> <li>Analysts also expect revenue to grow around 2% a year while the business stays unprofitable, which keeps the consensus claim of improving margins under pressure until the income statement actually moves back into the black.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly EPS losses and the bullish story</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, every quarter showed a basic EPS loss, ranging from a US$0.01 loss in Q2 2025 to a US$0.11 loss in Q3 2025, compared with a small profit of US$0.01 per share in Q4 2024.</li> <li>Bulls point to potential margin expansion and reduced losses over multiple years, but the run of quarterly EPS losses in 2025 sits awkwardly against that. This suggests the bullish view is leaning heavily on future improvements rather than what is currently visible in the reported numbers.\n<ul> <li>For example, Q3 2025 showed revenue of US$177.1 million with a net loss of US$11.5 million, which does not yet reflect the higher margin story bulls are expecting from cost control and capital recycling.</li> <li>Even in Q2 2025, where the loss narrowed to US$1.6 million on US$192.9 million of revenue, the company still did not produce positive EPS, so investors following the bullish view may want to watch whether that quarter proves repeatable or not.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bulls argue that limited new hotel supply and higher travel demand could be the turning point for Summit, but the current streak of quarterly EPS losses shows exactly why they see more upside if margins start to move their way. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0a1wloca-urbanization-and-hybrid-work-will-boost-premium-hotel-demand-x6j6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Summit Hotel Properties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap vs DCF and bearish concerns</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at US$4.65 compared with a DCF fair value of about US$6.04, and the P/S ratio of 0.7x sits well below the 4.2x average for Global Hotel and Resort REITs.</li> <li>Bears focus on high leverage, weak interest coverage, and forecasts of earnings declining an average 34.6% a year over the next three years. That combination helps explain why the market price stays below the DCF fair value and well under the US$5.63 analyst target, despite the apparently low P/S multiple.\n<ul> <li>Interest payments are described as not well covered by earnings, which fits with the trailing 12 month net loss of US$23.6 million and keeps financing risk front of mind for cautious investors.</li> <li>With revenue only expected to grow around 2% a year, slower than the 10.4% US market forecast, skeptics can argue that a discount to both the 6.04 DCF fair value and the 5.63 target price is not surprising while profitability and coverage ratios look stretched.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that weak interest coverage and ongoing losses could matter more than the apparent valuation discount, which is why many are watching how quickly earnings and cash coverage improve relative to debt costs. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/p77jwp5c-remote-work-pressures-and-demographic-trends-will-undermine-sunbelt-markets-1ksz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Summit Hotel Properties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3wvd0s-inn-net-profit-margin-improvement-and-share-buyback-will-support-future-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Summit Hotel Properties on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of risks and potential rewards feels finely balanced, take a closer look at the figures yourself and decide where you stand.

of US$652.5 million and net income of US$21.3 million.</li> <li>Critics highlight that low and contracting margins could cap earnings power, and the margin move from 3.9% to 3.3% lines up with that concern, \n    <ul> <li>the consensus narrative talks about gross margins around the 5% range and the need to grow higher margin solutions and services, which ties directly to this margin squeeze at the net level</li> <li>at the same time, earnings still grew 17.5% over the past year, so the bearish focus on margin pressure has to be weighed against the fact that profits have continued to rise in absolute terms</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bears warn that thin margins and integration risk could limit upside even with earnings growth showing up in the latest numbers. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Climb Global Solutions Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>17.5% Earnings Growth Versus Modest Revenue Trend</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew 17.5% while revenue growth is described as modest at about 1.2% per year in the provided context, with trailing twelve month EPS at US$4.71 on revenue of US$652.5 million.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests that adding high growth vendors, expanding internationally and investing in automation can support strong and sustained earnings growth, \n    <ul> <li>the 17.5% trailing earnings growth and roughly 25% per year compound earnings growth over five years are consistent with that bullish view on profit expansion</li> <li>however, the modest 1.2% revenue growth versus a 10.4% US market pace shows that top line momentum is slower than the broader market, which is an important counterpoint for that optimistic storyline</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Mixed Signals From P/E And DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>CLMB trades on a 19.1x P/E with a share price of US$90.03, below the US Electronic industry average of 28.3x but above its peer average of 13.5x, and well under a DCF fair value of about US$208.35 and an analyst price target of US$133.00.</li> <li>What stands out in the bullish argument is the gap between current price and value estimates, \n    <ul> <li>supporters can point to the roughly 56.8% difference between the US$90.03 share price and the DCF fair value of about US$208.35 as evidence that the market is not fully reflecting trailing earnings growth of 17.5%</li> <li>yet the fact that CLMB trades richer than peers on P/E at 19.1x versus 13.5x means skeptics can argue that some of that growth is already acknowledged, even if the stock is cheaper than the broader industry and below the US$133.00 analyst target</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls argue that the wide gap to DCF fair value and earnings track record could matter more than the premium to peers. <a

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are looking at OceanFirst Financial and wondering whether its current share price lines up with its underlying worth, you are asking the exact question this article is built to tackle.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$19.04, with returns of 3.8% over the past 30 days, 6.7% year to date, and 12.8% over the past year. The 3 year and 5 year returns sit at a 5.6% decline and a 5.0% gain respectively.</li> <li>These share price moves sit against a backdrop of ongoing sector wide attention on US regional banks, with investors watching how balance sheets and funding profiles hold up compared to peers. Recent coverage has focused on how smaller banks are positioned within the broader financial sector. This helps frame how a bank like OceanFirst Financial might be assessed by the market.</li> <li>On our checks, OceanFirst Financial has a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of 6</a>.

It focuses on what the bank earns on its equity relative to its cost of equity.</p> <p>For OceanFirst Financial, the model uses a Book Value of US$28.97 per share and a Stable EPS of US$1.62 per share, based on the median return on equity from the past 5 years. The Average Return on Equity is 6.26%, compared with a Cost of Equity of US$2.18 per share. This setup leads to an Excess Return of US$0.56 per share and a Stable Book Value of US$25.85 per share, which is based on weighted future book value estimates from three analysts.</p> <p>Combining these inputs, the Excess Returns model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about US$14.69 per share. Against the recent share price of US$19.04, this implies the stock is around 29.6% overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests OceanFirst Financial may be overvalued by 29.6%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OCFC Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for OceanFirst Financial.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: OceanFirst Financial Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable bank like OceanFirst Financial, the P/E ratio is a practical way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of current earnings. Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger earnings growth or see lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations are more muted or risks feel higher.</p> <p>OceanFirst Financial currently trades on a P/E of 16.28x. That sits above the Banks industry average P/E of 11.75x and the peer average of 12.76x, so the market is currently paying a higher price for its earnings than these broad reference points suggest.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what P/E might make sense for OceanFirst Financial specifically, given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio is 26.69x, which is materially higher than the current 16.28x. On this view, the shares appear undervalued relative to what the model suggests could be a more company specific P/E level.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St these Narratives live on the Community page, where millions of investors can set a fair value and compare it with the current price to help frame buy or sell decisions. They can then see that view update automatically as new news or earnings come in. For OceanFirst Financial, one investor might build a Narrative around the higher US$22.75 price target with stronger revenue and margin assumptions, while another anchors on the US$18.50 target with more conservative expectations, and both can see in real time how their story, numbers and fair value stay aligned with the latest information.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OceanFirst Financial? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/OCFC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ocfc/oceanfirst-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d4b55d74-f957-43b6-833e-c5884657fdf1/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:OCFC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The 1 day share price return is 7.14%, the 30 day share price return is 31.71%, and the 1 year total shareholder return is 146.59%. This points to sentiment that has been building over both the short and longer term.</p> <p>If this move in tanker stocks has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to see what else is moving in energy and infrastructure via our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_power_grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473750/power-grid-technology-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">23 power grid technology and infrastructure stocks</a>.</p> <p>With the share price up sharply and Nordic American Tankers trading around a 16% discount to the US$6.25 analyst price target, the key question is whether there is still value on the table or if the market already reflects expectations for future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred Price-to-Sales of 3.9x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Nordic American Tankers last closed at $5.40, yet on a P/S basis the shares screen as expensive compared with both peers and an estimated fair level.</p> <p>The preferred multiple here is the price-to-sales ratio, which sits at 3.9x for Nordic American Tankers. For a tanker owner with $294.82m of revenue and earnings that include large one off items, this kind of sales multiple can reflect expectations that current conditions in shipping will support stronger profitability than recent reported margins suggest.</p> <p>Against peers, the gap is clear. The company trades at a 3.9x P/S ratio, while the US Oil and Gas industry average is 1.7x. In other words, the stock is priced at more than double that reference point. Our fair P/S ratio estimate is 0.7x, implying a level the market could move toward if expectations for Nordic American Tankers were to line up with that fair ratio framework.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Nordic American Tankers</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 3.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh risks such as revenue falling 4.9% year on year and the current P/S multiple resetting if shipping conditions or earnings prove less supportive.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-nat/nordic-american-tankers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Nordic American Tankers narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Points to a Very Different Price</h2> <p>Our DCF model paints a sharper contrast.

This gives a mixed picture for investors weighing recent weakness against longer term performance.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Geely has focused on its position in the Hong Kong auto sector and how sentiment has shifted between traditional and newer energy vehicle makers.

The latest twelve month free cash flow sits at about CN¥5.9b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2027, with CN¥31.5b projected for 2026 and CN¥33.7b for 2027, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to 2035, reaching a projected free cash flow of CN¥45.4b in that year.</p> <p>When all these projected cash flows are discounted back using the DCF model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at HK$45.24 per share. Compared with the recent share price of HK$16.31, this suggests the stock is 63.9% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Geely Automobile Holdings is undervalued by 63.9%.

This can be more meaningful than looking at revenue or assets alone.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on what the market thinks about a company’s earnings growth and risk. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually points to a lower one.</p> <p>Geely currently trades on a P/E of 9.41x. That sits below the Auto industry average of 19.30x and also below the peer group average of 10.79x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Geely is 11.12x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be reasonable after considering factors like earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk.

At that time, hardly anyone thought about voice AI. However, over more than two decades, the team accumulated diverse experience with this technology, building a moat of over 280 patents that set it apart from competitors.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Hormel Foods (HRL) opened fiscal Q1 2026 with revenue of about US$3.0 billion and basic EPS of US$0.33, setting a clear snapshot of where the business stands as earnings season gets underway. The company has seen quarterly revenue move in a tight band around US$3.0 billion over the past year, while basic EPS has ranged from a loss of roughly US$0.10 in Q4 2025 to US$0.40 in Q4 2024. This gives investors a mixed but data rich backdrop for judging this quarter. With trailing net profit margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier and earnings forecast to grow faster than revenue, the key question now is how durable Hormel’s margin profile really looks.</p> <a

Income Swings and Margin Pressure</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last six quarters, net income has moved from a loss of US$56.1 million in Q4 2025 to US$181.8 million in Q1 2026, while trailing 12 month profit stands at US$489.4 million on US$12.1b of revenue, aligning with the 4% net margin figure.</li> <li> Bears focus on profitability pressure, and the numbers give them some support alongside some pushback.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing net margin at 4% versus 6.4% a year earlier lines up with concerns about margin compression from volatile input costs like pork, beef, and nuts.</li> <li>At the same time, recent quarterly net income in the US$170 million to US$184 million range across most of the last five quarters, apart from Q4 2025, suggests earnings have remained relatively steady even as longer term margins have tightened.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year Hormel’s margin strain has been a key talking point for skeptics, so this mix of steady recent profits and lower trailing margins makes the bear case more nuanced than a simple profitability decline story. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hormel Foods Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>EPS Stability vs Forecast Growth Story</h2> <ul> <li>Basic EPS has hovered around US$0.31 to US$0.33 in four of the last five quarters, with a Q4 2025 loss and a Q4 2024 EPS of US$0.40 as the outliers, while earnings are forecast to grow about 11.18% per year compared with roughly 2% revenue growth.</li> <li> The consensus narrative that earnings growth can run ahead of sales growth is tested by this steady but unspectacular EPS pattern.\n    <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month EPS of US$0.89 compares with quarterly EPS near US$0.33 in Q1 2026 and Q3 2025, which is below the US$0.40 level seen in Q4 2024 and below earlier trailing EPS figures like US$1.47 a year ago.</li> <li>Forecasts calling for earnings to grow faster than revenue suggest better margins over time, yet today’s trailing 4% net margin and flat recent EPS band show that the margin uplift implied by those forecasts is not visible in the recent history supplied.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rich P/E, Dividend Strain and DCF Upside</h2> <ul> <li>Hormel trades on a trailing P/E of 27.9x versus 24.2x for the broader US Food industry and 13.2x for peers, while offering a 4.71% dividend yield that is not well covered by earnings or free cash flow, and a DCF fair value of US$48.41 compared with a current share price of US$24.82.</li> <li> Bulls point to long term earnings growth and valuation upside, and the figures both support and complicate that view.\n    <ul> <li>The stock price of US$24.82 sitting well below the DCF fair value of US$48.41 fits the optimistic claim of meaningful upside if earnings forecasts are met.</li> <li>However, the combination of a premium 27.9x P/E, a 4% trailing net margin, and a dividend that is not well covered means the bullish argument depends heavily on the expected margin improvement and cash generation that are not yet reflected in the trailing data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that richer P/E and stretched dividend against the potential DCF upside, it is worth seeing how bullish investors connect these earnings trends to their long term case for Hormel. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hormel Foods Bull

Analysts provide explicit forecasts out to 2027, with Free Cash Flow projected at $82.10 million in that year, and Simply Wall St extends those forecasts further using its own assumptions, out to 2035, keeping everything in dollars and in millions.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today under this model, the estimated intrinsic value comes out at about $86.31 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $62.34, the DCF suggests Astec Industries trades at roughly a 27.8% discount, which screens as undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Astec Industries is undervalued by 27.8%.

It is a quick way to see how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risks. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can point to a lower one.</p> <p>Astec Industries currently trades on a P/E of 36.75x. That sits above the Machinery industry average of about 28.70x and below the peer group average of roughly 41.03x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Astec Industries is 30.79x, which is its view of what a reasonable P/E would be after factoring in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the industry, because it adjusts for those business specific characteristics rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. With the actual P/E of 36.75x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 30.79x, Astec Industries appears overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

You set out your story for Astec Industries, link that story to a forecast for revenue, earnings and margins, and end up with your own Fair Value that you can compare with today’s price on the Community page. This page is used by millions of investors, so your view updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. You can see, for example, one investor building a Narrative that supports a Fair Value of about US$86 per share, while another, more cautious view aligns with a Fair Value closer to US$56.50. Each uses the same company but very different expectations to decide whether the current price looks attractive or not.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Astec Industries? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/ASTE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-aste/astec-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/17a0383e-2905-49ef-8f00-5be25d110ada/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:ASTE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The company has seen quarterly revenue range from US$383.6 million in Q4 2024 to US$490.7 million in Q1 2025, while basic EPS has swung from a small profit of US$0.02 in Q4 2024 to progressively larger quarterly losses through 2025.

That view sits against a five year history where losses widened at roughly 13.2% per year and the latest TTM period still shows US$63.5 million in losses, so the optimistic case leans heavily on a future margin shift that is not visible in these reported numbers.</li> </ul> <h2>Quarterly losses widened sharply in Q4 2025</h2> <ul> <li>Q4 2025 net income excluding extra items was a loss of US$56.0 million on revenue of US$410.4 million, compared with smaller quarterly losses earlier in 2025 that ranged from about US$0.6 million to US$4.5 million on revenues between US$460.8 million and US$490.7 million.</li> <li>Bears argue that dependence on cyclical equipment demand and large OEM customers could keep earnings under pressure. The pattern in 2025, where quarterly losses moved from roughly US$0.6 million in Q1 to US$56.0 million by Q4 while revenue stayed within a US$410 million to US$491 million band, gives their argument support that profitability has been fragile even without a collapse in the top line.\n    <ul> <li>The data also shows that over the last five years, losses widened at about 13.2% per year, which fits with the cautious view that earnings volatility and operating leverage have worked against shareholders recently.</li> <li>With the share price at US$9.90 and the business still loss making over the last twelve months, skeptics may question how quickly any forecast profit recovery can show through in reported EPS.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Bears warn that the latest step up in quarterly losses could signal that tighter OEM spending or cost pressure bites harder than optimistic scenarios assume, especially if order patterns stay uneven.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/lubktl12-trade-and-oem-risks-will-delay-recovery-yet-spark-optimism-1mqc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Titan International Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Mixed valuation signals at US$9.90 share price</h2> <ul> <li>The data shows a P/S of 0.3x compared with a peer average of 1.7x and a US Machinery industry average of 2.3x. A DCF fair value of US$7.71 per share sits below the current US$9.90 price.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view point to the low 0.3x P/S multiple and the earnings growth forecasts as backing their case for upside, but the DCF fair value of US$7.71 being below the current share price and the company’s current TTM loss of US$63.5 million mean the market is already pricing in some improvement. That leaves less room for error if revenue growth of 3.7% per year and recent loss trends persist instead of quickly swinging toward the earnings levels implied by an 11.25 analyst target.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus expectations in the data look for revenue growth of 5.5% per year and margins moving from about 1.2% loss making today to a 2.5% profit margin by 2028, so the gap between those future assumptions and today’s US$63.5 million loss is what investors are effectively paying for at US$9.90.</li> <li>If earnings track closer to the more cautious path, where margins are still only 6.0% by 2028 and earnings are US$124.5 million, the current discount to an 11.25 target is smaller than it appears once the DCF fair value of US$7.71 is factored into the range of views.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how optimistic investors connect these valuation signals to their thesis on margins and growth, have a look at the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Titan International Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/iee57cl7-global-urbanization-and-smart-farming-will-drive-secular-demand-ho0e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Titan International on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With the mix of bullish hopes and cautious signals in the numbers, it is worth taking a closer look at the data yourself and moving quickly to shape your own view.
