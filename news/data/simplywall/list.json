The report illustrates growing expectations for AI investment, yet points to lingering challenges around realizing value at scale.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-os/onestream\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for OneStream.</a></p> <p>Over the past year, OneStream’s 1-year total shareholder return has fallen 40.6 percent, reflecting ongoing investor caution even as annual revenue grows and interest in enterprise AI keeps building. Despite upbeat sentiment around the company's innovation, the 7-day share price return was positive. However, year-to-date movement and the 90-day share price return both indicate that momentum is still fading.</p> <p>If OneStream’s latest AI push has you thinking bigger, it may be the perfect time to broaden your investing search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>Given OneStream’s expanding AI ambitions and current discounts to analyst price targets, should investors view recent share declines as an undervaluation?

This sets the table for a deeper look into the justifications behind an optimistic view on future growth and profitability.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Ongoing large-scale digital transformation across industries, with CFOs increasingly seeking unified platforms to replace legacy financial systems, strongly positions OneStream to capture expanding market share, supporting sustained subscription revenue and new customer growth. Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts. This is positioning OneStream's cloud-native Intelligent Finance Platform for higher recurring and ratable revenues and contributing to predictable top-line expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/jcg9s894-digital-transformation-and-cloud-adoption-will-fuel-market-opportunities-czbv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Want to know what’s fueling such a big fair value gap?

The recent swing to a net loss, despite ongoing modernization and sustainability milestones, keeps the spotlight squarely on soft demand as the most important short-term catalyst, while execution risk on ambitious cost reduction targets remains the most significant threat. While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant. This EUR 60 million investment is central to Metsä Board’s strategy of boosting product quality and supporting its transition to fossil-free production, underscoring the company’s push for cost efficiency and alignment with long-term sustainability trends that underpin revenue recovery prospects.\n</p> <p> But with European demand still sluggish and restructuring ongoing, investors should be mindful that even well-executed upgrades cannot fully offset...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fi/materials/hel-metsb/metsa-board-oyj-shares/pd0x5y6d-cost-efficiency-and-fiber-packaging-will-drive-long-term-success-dfbf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Metsä Board Oyj (it's free!)</a></p><p>Metsä Board Oyj’s narrative projects €2.1 billion revenue and €124.4 million earnings by 2028.

You are not alone; a lot of investors are asking the same thing right now.</li> <li>Kratos shares have delivered a powerful rally this year, soaring 245.8% year-to-date and an eye-popping 286.6% over the past 12 months, with a strong 8.2% gain just in the last week.</li> <li>Shares have surged as investors react to growing interest in defense and security spending, bolstered by ongoing global tensions and an increased focus on advanced military technologies.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The last closing price was ¥8,750.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings multiple measures how much investors are willing to pay per yen of company earnings. In software and technology sectors, higher PE ratios sometimes correspond with strong growth prospects, reliable profits, or perceived quality.</p> <p>OBIC Business Consultants is considered good value compared to its peer average PE of 58.8x, suggesting the market recognizes upside relative to other software firms. However, compared to the broader Japanese software industry average of just 21.1x, this multiple is steep. Against our estimated fair PE ratio of 27.6x, the current valuation also appears stretched.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Wacoal Holdings (TSE:3591) has updated its consolidated earnings forecast for the second quarter, pointing to a 9% drop in revenue as sluggish sales in major markets continue, including softness in women’s innerwear and persistent challenges in the U.S. retail landscape. The company’s full-year outlook is now under review, raising questions about the path forward for this established name in apparel.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Wacoal Holdings.</a></p> <p>Wacoal’s shares have seen modest gains over the past year, with a 2% year-to-date share price return. The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

The renewed optimism about a US-China trade truce could ease Levi's cost pressures, potentially becoming the most important short-term catalyst, while ongoing exposure to tariff fluctuations and slow progress in China remain significant risks.

While the recent foundry orders showcase solid customer traction and reinforce product differentiation, they do not materially alter the biggest short-term catalyst, broad-based order momentum in advanced packaging, nor do they meaningfully reduce Veeco’s largest risk of customer and geographic concentration.\n</p> <p> The October 2025 announcement of multiple new orders for WaferStorm, WaferEtch, and AP300 systems is the most relevant recent development, as these platforms underpin Veeco’s push into high-growth advanced packaging and next-generation device manufacturing. This aligns closely with the catalyst surrounding demand strength in high-performance computing and silicon photonics, marking continued validation of Veeco’s core technology in critical markets.\n</p> <p> But despite these positive signals, investors should keep in mind the continued risk if future orders remain concentrated in just a few customers or regions...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-veco/veeco-instruments/ntgzg4es-macroeconomic-uncertainty-will-compress-semiconductor-industry-margins-vi0n\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Veeco Instruments (it's free!)</a></p><p>Veeco Instruments' outlook anticipates $782.0 million in revenue and $66.0 million in earnings by 2028.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype. When this multiple is far higher than sector benchmarks, it usually implies that the market is pricing in exceptional results ahead or possibly overestimating prospects.</p> <p>Compared to its direct peers, who average just 2.2x, and the broader US Aerospace &amp; Defense industry at 3.1x, Karman Holdings' ratio is conspicuously elevated. Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple. Such a wide premium suggests investors should take a hard look at the underlying growth assumptions that are driving KRMN's lofty valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Karman Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Preferred multiple of price-to-sales 28.9x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, signs of overvaluation and the stock trading below analyst price targets could trigger a sentiment shift if growth expectations are not fully realized.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-krmn/karman-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Karman Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Suggests Shares Are Overvalued</h2> <p>Looking at Karman Holdings through the lens of our SWS DCF model creates a starkly different picture.

Having said that, from a first glance at <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BVMF:AMBP3</a>) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.

Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.
