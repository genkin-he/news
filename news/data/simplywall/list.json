The Recorlev patent lawsuit is important for protecting potential long term cash flows, but in the near term the key catalyst is still execution around upcoming earnings and commercial performance, while the biggest risk remains Xeris’s reliance on a small set of branded products.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the upcoming March 2, 2026 earnings report, with consensus expecting US$0.04 EPS and full year 2025 revenue around US$292,000,000, looks especially relevant. Those results will give investors a fresh read on how Recorlev, Gvoke, and Keveyis are performing just as Xeris moves to defend Recorlev’s patents, and may influence how investors weigh the benefit of extended exclusivity against ongoing R&amp;D and SG&amp;A spending.</p> <p>Yet while the lawsuit aims to secure Recorlev’s future, investors should also factor in the risk that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings/9pjzm8dt-xers-higher-2025-revenue-guidance-will-drive-measured-financial-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Xeris Biopharma Holdings (it's free!)</a></p><p>Xeris Biopharma Holdings' narrative projects $440.9 million revenue and $84.8 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings/9pjzm8dt-xers-higher-2025-revenue-guidance-will-drive-measured-financial-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Xeris Biopharma Holdings' forecasts yield a $11.14 fair value</a>, a 82% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"XERS 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/34985fb8-c88a-498a-8524-1011a674e966/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>XERS 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Some of the lowest estimating analysts were already more cautious, even while assuming revenue could reach about US$414,200,000 and earnings about US$21,400,000 by 2028, so this fresh legal uncertainty around Recorlev’s patents could push their already more pessimistic view further, and it is worth asking yourself which version of Xeris’s future you find more convincing.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 4 other fair value estimates on Xeris Biopharma Holdings</a> - why the stock might be worth 23% less than the current price!</p><h2>Reach Your Own Conclusion</h2><p>Don't just follow the ticker - dig into the data and build a conviction that's truly your own.</p><ul><li>A great starting point for your Xeris Biopharma Holdings research is our analysis highlighting <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a> that could impact your investment decision.</li><li><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-xers/xeris-biopharma-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our free Xeris Biopharma Holdings research report</a> provides a comprehensive fundamental analysis summarized in a single visual - the Snowflake - making it easy to evaluate Xeris Biopharma Holdings' overall financial health at a glance.</li></ul><h2>Ready For A Different Approach?</h2><p>These stocks are moving-our analysis flagged them today.

This points to a discount at the current ¥1,570.5 share price.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so it effectively tells you how much investors are paying for each unit of earnings. For a real estate group that is already profitable and generating net income of ¥92,302 million, P/E is a straightforward way to gauge how the market is pricing those earnings today.</p> <p>Here, the company screens as good value against several yardsticks. The current 12.1x P/E is below the estimated fair P/E of 16.2x. It also sits below the peer average of 14.3x, the Japan real estate industry average of 12.8x, and the broader Japan market at 15.6x. That combination suggests the market is pricing Tokyu Fudosan Holdings at a lower earnings multiple than these reference points, while our fair ratio work points to a level the market could move towards if perceptions of its earnings strength and growth potential align with those benchmarks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-3289/tokyu-fudosan-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Tokyu Fudosan Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-earnings of 12.1x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you are still relying on analyst estimates for that fair P/E, and on earnings that tie closely to real estate and energy markets, which can be cyclical.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/real-estate-management-and-development/tse-3289/tokyu-fudosan-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Tokyu Fudosan Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: DCF Paints A Different Picture</h2> <p>While the 12.1x P/E suggests Tokyu Fudosan Holdings looks inexpensive, our DCF model points a very different way. It indicates an estimated future cash flow value of ¥654.05 compared with the current ¥1,570.5 share price. On that basis, the shares screen as overvalued rather than cheap.

The latest result, with a reduced A$4.78 million net loss and a smaller A$0.02 loss per share, reinforces the core short term catalyst: further operating leverage as revenue scales. It also slightly softens one of the key risks highlighted earlier, that ongoing cash burn could require fresh capital if progress stalled. That said, the sharp share price pullback over the past quarter suggests the market remains cautious about execution, competitive pressures and the timing of any move into profitability. In that context, this half-year update helps, but does not remove, the central risk that profitability could take longer or prove harder than expected.</p> However, one risk around future funding needs is something investors should pay close attention to.\n\nDespite retreating, SiteMinder's shares might still be trading 38% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b2979078-1620-4ca0-a9bd-9c9d16b95979/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Ten fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span A$4.40 to A$10.75, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

For a utility like Hokkaido Electric it reflects what investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings given its regulated returns, capital intensity and cash flow profile.</p> <p>Here, the stock is described as expensive versus its immediate peer average P/E of 4.2x. It is also framed as good value against the Asian Electric Utilities average of 17.6x and a fair P/E estimate of 9.5x, suggesting the market is pricing its earnings materially lower than the level that model implies it could move towards.</p> <p>Relative to the broader JP market P/E of 15.6x, the 4.4x P/E is also much lower, which again underlines how compressed the multiple looks compared with both domestic equities and the sector wide context.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Hokkaido Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 4.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh regulatory changes or project delays at Ishikariwan Shinko that could affect earnings, cash flows, and how reliable that P/E looks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Hokkaido Electric Power Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points the other way</h2> <p>While the 4.4x P/E suggests room to move closer to the 9.5x fair ratio, our DCF model is more conservative.

The latest results show narrower losses and modest revenue growth, but the key near term catalyst remains whether Claritev can keep reducing losses while stabilizing its balance sheet. The biggest risk is still its dependence on a few large payor and TPA relationships, and this update does not materially change that.</p> <p>The new US$75 million share repurchase program, capped at US$20 million per year through 2030, is the most relevant announcement here. It intersects directly with the near term focus on cost control and cash generation, since buybacks will draw on cash on hand and operating cash flows. For investors, the real test is whether Claritev can support this program while funding ongoing AI, cloud, and international initiatives that underpin its longer term growth catalysts.</p> <p>Yet even with shrinking losses and a buyback in place, investors still need to weigh the concentration risk in Claritev’s largest client contracts and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-ctev/claritev/tkit8a2w-analysts-boost-claritev-valuation-amid-growth-optimism-and-strategic-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Claritev (it's free!)</a></p><p>Claritev's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $90.0 million earnings by 2028.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 36.6% and very large 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns suggest momentum has been building over several years rather than just in the latest rally.</p> <p>If Chartwell’s run has you thinking more broadly about where capital could work hardest next, it may be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 healthcare AI stocks</a> for fresh ideas across the sector.</p> <p>With Chartwell generating revenue of CA$1.11b and net income of CA$29.41m, and trading only slightly below a CA$23.70 analyst price target, it is worth asking whether there is still a buying opportunity here or whether the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, Chartwell’s fair value comes out at CA$23.05, a touch above the CA$22.22 last close. This puts the focus on what assumptions are doing the heavy lifting.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chartwell's financial results and guidance point to a sustained increase in demand for senior housing, driven by a rapidly growing seniors population and persistent supply constraints, supporting rising occupancy and driving long term revenue and NOI growth. The company is executing on a strategy of acquiring and developing newer, larger, and more operationally efficient properties expected to produce higher occupancy rates, greater per suite NOI, and enhanced margins as lease ups mature.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what sits behind that CA$23.05 figure? The narrative leans on robust top line expansion, firmer margins, and a rich future earnings multiple that is described as anything but conservative.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$23.05 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the picture could change if elevated leverage and refinancing costs squeeze margins, or if higher labour expenses erode the modest profit improvements that analysts are banking on.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/healthcare/tsx-csh.un/chartwell-retirement-residences-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Chartwell Retirement Residences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle: rich sales multiple vs fair ratio</h2> <p>The AI fair value story leans toward modest undervaluation, but the sales multiple tells a different tale. Chartwell trades on a P/S of 6.4x, far above the North American Healthcare industry at 1.2x and peers at 1.3x, and well ahead of its own fair ratio of 3.5x.</p> <p>That gap suggests the market is already paying a premium for future growth. This leaves less room for error if margins, interest costs or occupancy do not line up with expectations.

The latest full-year 2025 results show higher revenue and net income, with basic EPS up to US$1.37, which helps validate that story after a flatter profit track record. The affirmed US$0.09 quarterly dividend reinforces a message of stability rather than signaling any major shift in capital allocation, so it is unlikely to change the near term catalysts in a material way. Instead, the more immediate focus remains on how the company manages input costs, protects margins, and justifies a relatively rich earnings multiple after a strong 12‑month total return. The recent results support confidence, but they also raise the bar for expectations.</p> However, that higher valuation makes any stumble on margins or demand more painful for shareholders to absorb.\nTootsie Roll Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 10%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9f8185b7-359c-4591-99fd-ca67babeda42/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Simply Wall St Community members currently offer just one fair value view at about US$38.53, giving you a single reference point rather than a broad range of opinions.
