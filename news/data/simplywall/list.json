The latest result, with a reduced A$4.78 million net loss and a smaller A$0.02 loss per share, reinforces the core short term catalyst: further operating leverage as revenue scales. It also slightly softens one of the key risks highlighted earlier, that ongoing cash burn could require fresh capital if progress stalled. That said, the sharp share price pullback over the past quarter suggests the market remains cautious about execution, competitive pressures and the timing of any move into profitability. In that context, this half-year update helps, but does not remove, the central risk that profitability could take longer or prove harder than expected.</p> However, one risk around future funding needs is something investors should pay close attention to.\n\nDespite retreating, SiteMinder's shares might still be trading 38% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b2979078-1620-4ca0-a9bd-9c9d16b95979/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Ten fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span A$4.40 to A$10.75, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

For a utility like Hokkaido Electric it reflects what investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings given its regulated returns, capital intensity and cash flow profile.</p> <p>Here, the stock is described as expensive versus its immediate peer average P/E of 4.2x. It is also framed as good value against the Asian Electric Utilities average of 17.6x and a fair P/E estimate of 9.5x, suggesting the market is pricing its earnings materially lower than the level that model implies it could move towards.</p> <p>Relative to the broader JP market P/E of 15.6x, the 4.4x P/E is also much lower, which again underlines how compressed the multiple looks compared with both domestic equities and the sector wide context.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Hokkaido Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 4.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh regulatory changes or project delays at Ishikariwan Shinko that could affect earnings, cash flows, and how reliable that P/E looks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Hokkaido Electric Power Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points the other way</h2> <p>While the 4.4x P/E suggests room to move closer to the 9.5x fair ratio, our DCF model is more conservative.

The latest results show narrower losses and modest revenue growth, but the key near term catalyst remains whether Claritev can keep reducing losses while stabilizing its balance sheet. The biggest risk is still its dependence on a few large payor and TPA relationships, and this update does not materially change that.</p> <p>The new US$75 million share repurchase program, capped at US$20 million per year through 2030, is the most relevant announcement here. It intersects directly with the near term focus on cost control and cash generation, since buybacks will draw on cash on hand and operating cash flows. For investors, the real test is whether Claritev can support this program while funding ongoing AI, cloud, and international initiatives that underpin its longer term growth catalysts.</p> <p>Yet even with shrinking losses and a buyback in place, investors still need to weigh the concentration risk in Claritev’s largest client contracts and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-ctev/claritev/tkit8a2w-analysts-boost-claritev-valuation-amid-growth-optimism-and-strategic-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Claritev (it's free!)</a></p><p>Claritev's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $90.0 million earnings by 2028.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 36.6% and very large 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns suggest momentum has been building over several years rather than just in the latest rally.</p> <p>If Chartwell’s run has you thinking more broadly about where capital could work hardest next, it may be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 healthcare AI stocks</a> for fresh ideas across the sector.</p> <p>With Chartwell generating revenue of CA$1.11b and net income of CA$29.41m, and trading only slightly below a CA$23.70 analyst price target, it is worth asking whether there is still a buying opportunity here or whether the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, Chartwell’s fair value comes out at CA$23.05, a touch above the CA$22.22 last close. This puts the focus on what assumptions are doing the heavy lifting.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chartwell's financial results and guidance point to a sustained increase in demand for senior housing, driven by a rapidly growing seniors population and persistent supply constraints, supporting rising occupancy and driving long term revenue and NOI growth. The company is executing on a strategy of acquiring and developing newer, larger, and more operationally efficient properties expected to produce higher occupancy rates, greater per suite NOI, and enhanced margins as lease ups mature.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what sits behind that CA$23.05 figure? The narrative leans on robust top line expansion, firmer margins, and a rich future earnings multiple that is described as anything but conservative.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$23.05 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the picture could change if elevated leverage and refinancing costs squeeze margins, or if higher labour expenses erode the modest profit improvements that analysts are banking on.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/healthcare/tsx-csh.un/chartwell-retirement-residences-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Chartwell Retirement Residences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle: rich sales multiple vs fair ratio</h2> <p>The AI fair value story leans toward modest undervaluation, but the sales multiple tells a different tale. Chartwell trades on a P/S of 6.4x, far above the North American Healthcare industry at 1.2x and peers at 1.3x, and well ahead of its own fair ratio of 3.5x.</p> <p>That gap suggests the market is already paying a premium for future growth. This leaves less room for error if margins, interest costs or occupancy do not line up with expectations.

Right now, the most important near term catalyst is clarity from the accounting probe, because it directly affects confidence in Nidec’s reported margins and cash flows. The biggest risk is that any control weaknesses or legal findings prove deeper than currently known and weigh on profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the latest Q3 earnings beat and upgraded guidance matter because they show progress on margin stabilization in industrial motors and automotive, which sits at the core of the restructuring story. Stronger earnings and cash flow provide more flexibility for Nidec to keep investing in motors for data centers and EVs while absorbing any near term costs related to governance reforms and potential compliance fixes.</p> <p>Yet investors should also be aware that the ongoing trade compliance investigations could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/jp/capital-goods/tse-6594/nidec-shares/ahdigll5-6594-new-arkansas-expansion-will-drive-positive-momentum-into-2027\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Nidec (it's free!)</a></p><p>Nidec's narrative projects ¥2,893.2 billion revenue and ¥247.5 billion earnings by 2028.

The latest full-year 2025 results show higher revenue and net income, with basic EPS up to US$1.37, which helps validate that story after a flatter profit track record. The affirmed US$0.09 quarterly dividend reinforces a message of stability rather than signaling any major shift in capital allocation, so it is unlikely to change the near term catalysts in a material way. Instead, the more immediate focus remains on how the company manages input costs, protects margins, and justifies a relatively rich earnings multiple after a strong 12‑month total return. The recent results support confidence, but they also raise the bar for expectations.</p> However, that higher valuation makes any stumble on margins or demand more painful for shareholders to absorb.\nTootsie Roll Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 10%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9f8185b7-359c-4591-99fd-ca67babeda42/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Simply Wall St Community members currently offer just one fair value view at about US$38.53, giving you a single reference point rather than a broad range of opinions.

The swing to a US$61.8 million net loss makes execution risk around restructuring and cost savings more immediate, but does not fundamentally change the key near-term catalyst: progress on returning core operations to consistent profitability. The biggest risk remains that EV-related weakness and restructuring drag out longer than expected, prolonging losses.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the completion of the multi-year share repurchase program is most relevant here. Buying back 2,120,103 shares, or 11.48% of the share base for US$147.44 million, slightly amplifies the impact of any future earnings recovery on a per-share basis, but it also sharpens focus on whether the new quarterly sales guidance of US$193 million to US$208 million is a step toward stabilizing results or a prelude to further...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers/jjp5kfkp-analyst-maintains-rogers-price-target-amid-stable-valuation-and-modest-profit-margin-adjustment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Rogers (it's free!)</a></p><p>Rogers’ narrative projects $921.6 million revenue and $83.3 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers/jjp5kfkp-analyst-maintains-rogers-price-target-amid-stable-valuation-and-modest-profit-margin-adjustment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how Rogers' forecasts yield a $124.33 fair value</a>, a 15% upside to its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ROG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a6f41413-9bad-48be-bc64-776d511e4c77/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ROG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>By contrast, the most bullish analysts were assuming revenue could reach about US$1.0 billion and earnings near US$318.0 million, which is far more optimistic than the curamik restructuring risk highlighted earlier, and you should recognize that views like this may shift meaningfully after the latest net loss and guidance.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/tech/nyse-rog/rogers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 2 other fair value estimates on Rogers</a> - why the stock might be worth as much as 15% more than the current price!</p><h2>The Verdict Is Yours</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

If DPS integrates smoothly and Kodiak secures enough new units on acceptable terms, the combination could support revenue and earnings growth, but any misstep on procurement or deployment timing would feed directly into the existing risk around capital intensity and potential overcapacity.</p> <p>Yet beneath Kodiak’s record 2025 numbers, investors should still be watching how its highly capital intensive model copes with...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-kgs/kodiak-gas-services/cieb1ckz-permian-basin-and-lng-exports-will-unlock-future-opportunities-gevd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Kodiak Gas Services (it's free!)</a></p><p>Kodiak Gas Services' narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $293.4 million earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) announced the retirement of Executive Chairman Thomas J. Pritzker after more than two decades in the role.</li> <li>The move comes alongside public mention of Pritzker's past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</li> <li>Hyatt has appointed current CEO Mark S. Hoplamazian as the new Chairman, concentrating leadership in a single figure.</li> <li>The transition highlights both succession planning and governance considerations for the company.</li> </ul> <p>For you as an investor, the key point is that Hyatt Hotels operates as a global hospitality company, with its results closely tied to travel demand, corporate bookings, and leisure trends. Leadership shifts at a company like this can matter because capital allocation, brand priorities, and risk oversight typically flow through the boardroom.</p> <p>The decision to move Mark S. Hoplamazian into the Chairman role suggests Hyatt is aiming for continuity while addressing reputational and governance questions head on. As you assess NYSE:H, this kind of transition is worth watching for any changes in board composition, disclosure practices, or long term direction that could affect how the company is run.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nyse-h/hyatt-hotels/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hyatt Hotels</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

For you as an investor, that concentrates decision making in one person, which can speed up responses on issues like capital allocation, portfolio reshaping, and expansion into markets such as India, where Hyatt has talked about a larger long term footprint. At the same time, combining the roles can raise governance questions about independent challenge in the boardroom, especially when reputational risk has just been put in the spotlight.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Hyatt Hotels Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The leadership handover to Hoplamazian could support execution of Hyatt’s asset light approach and development pipeline, because the same leader is setting strategy and overseeing the board that signs off on transactions and new projects.</li> <li>Concentrating the Chairman and CEO roles may challenge the governance pillar of the narrative, as some investors prefer separate roles when a company is pursuing large-scale expansion and complex acquisitions.</li> <li>Pritzker’s explicit reference to reputational issues linked to his past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and his focus on stewardship, may not be fully captured in prior narratives that center more on hotel growth and operating performance than on brand and governance risk.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/jbrfz0ry-h-expanding-luxury-openings-and-buybacks-will-drive-hospitality-leadership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Hyatt Hotels</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ The combination of Chairman and CEO roles can reduce independent oversight, which matters when the company is balancing growth projects, debt obligations, and brand risk in a competitive set that includes Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, and IHG.</li> <li>⚠️ The public mention of Pritzker’s past association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell introduces a reputational angle that could affect stakeholder perception and potentially influence how partners, guests, or regulators view the company.</li> <li>🎁 Leadership continuity, with a long serving CEO stepping into the Chair role, can help maintain consistency in Hyatt’s asset light approach and its push into markets such as India without a disruptive change at the top.</li> <li>🎁 The board’s emphasis on stewardship and succession planning may support long term stability, which can be important when management is managing a global pipeline and competing with other large operators for owners and franchisees.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how Hyatt’s board structure evolves, including any moves to reinforce independent oversight around Hoplamazian. Watch for disclosures on reputational and governance topics in future filings or shareholder communications, and whether the company adjusts its risk oversight frameworks. On the business side, track how consistently leadership executes on the asset light model and development goals while managing financial risks that analysts have already flagged. Comparing Hyatt’s progress against large peers over the next few years can help you judge whether this leadership setup is helping or hindering execution.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Hyatt Hotels, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/H\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Hyatt Hotels</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $41.1 million. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations feed into a ten year path where projected free cash flow reaches $177.2 million in 2030, with intermediate years such as 2026 to 2029 ranging from $60.6 million to $145.7 million before discounting.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back and added up, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $29.19 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $25.01, this implies the stock is roughly 14.3% undervalued according to this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Warby Parker is undervalued by 14.3%.

Higher growth and lower perceived risk usually support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often go with a lower one.</p> <p>Warby Parker currently trades at a P/S of 3.51x. That sits above the Specialty Retail industry average P/S of 0.46x and below the peer group average of 5.32x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Warby Parker is 1.74x, which is its view of what the P/S could be based on factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the sector because it tries to line up the multiple with the company’s own profile rather than broad group averages. With the current 3.51x P/S versus a Fair Ratio of 1.74x, the shares screen as trading above that Fair Ratio.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY P/S Ratio as at Mar 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

With Narratives, you set out a clear story for Warby Parker, link that story to your own revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, and end up with a Fair Value you can compare to the current price on Simply Wall St's Community page, used by millions of investors.</p> <p>A Narrative connects what you think is happening in the business to a financial forecast and then to a Fair Value. It updates automatically when new information like earnings or news, such as the appointment of a new CFO or progress on AI glasses, is added to the platform.</p> <p>For example, one investor might build a more optimistic Warby Parker Narrative with a Fair Value of US$32.00, while another might lean on a more cautious Narrative with a Fair Value of US$18.00. Comparing either of those to the latest market price can help you judge whether the stock looks expensive, cheap, or close to your own view of fair.</p> <p>For Warby Parker however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Warby Parker Narratives:</p> <p>Each one ties a clear story to specific assumptions on revenue, margins and valuation. Use them as starting points, not answers, and decide which feels closer to how you see the business.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/ebv0lo7c-google-partnership-and-retail-expansion-will-unlock-new-market-opportunities-hp9u?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Warby Parker Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$27.25</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at US$25.01: around 8%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 18.78% per year</p> <ul> <li>Assumes expansion of retail stores, shop in shops and eye care services supports higher active customers, higher average revenue per customer and better margins over time.</li> <li>Bakes in an AI and wearable tech angle, including the Google partnership and digital tools, as a way to open up new, higher margin revenue streams and improve efficiency.</li> <li>Accepts execution and competition risks, but treats current pricing as broadly in line with analyst expectations for revenue of about US$1.2b and higher earnings over the next few years.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker/y2hgxha2-update-for-warby-parker?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Warby Parker Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$18.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at US$25.01: around 39%</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 13.63% per year</p> <ul> <li>Focuses on the risk that AI glasses, heavy store growth and higher fixed costs do not translate into enough incremental profit, which could leave margins under pressure.</li> <li>Flags competition, insurance mix and reduced owned programs like home try on as potential headwinds for average revenue per customer and repeat engagement.</li> <li>Takes the low end of analyst price targets as a guide, viewing the current share price as baking in expectations that may be too optimistic relative to these risks.</li> </ul> <p>Both narratives use analyst style assumptions, but they reach very different conclusions on what counts as a reasonable price for the same cash flows. The real value for you is in deciding which set of assumptions feels closer to your own view of Warby Parker's growth, profitability and risk, then adjusting the numbers until the story and the valuation line up.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Warby Parker? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/WRBY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/retail/nyse-wrby/warby-parker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/451a246a-a01c-44df-9a64-033f9f258c8f/chart/quote-price?date=2026-03-01\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:WRBY 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
