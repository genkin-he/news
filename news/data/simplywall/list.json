The latest result, with a reduced A$4.78 million net loss and a smaller A$0.02 loss per share, reinforces the core short term catalyst: further operating leverage as revenue scales. It also slightly softens one of the key risks highlighted earlier, that ongoing cash burn could require fresh capital if progress stalled. That said, the sharp share price pullback over the past quarter suggests the market remains cautious about execution, competitive pressures and the timing of any move into profitability. In that context, this half-year update helps, but does not remove, the central risk that profitability could take longer or prove harder than expected.</p> However, one risk around future funding needs is something investors should pay close attention to.\n\nDespite retreating, SiteMinder's shares might still be trading 38% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/software/asx-sdr/siteminder-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b2979078-1620-4ca0-a9bd-9c9d16b95979/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASX:SDR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Ten fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community span A$4.40 to A$10.75, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

For a utility like Hokkaido Electric it reflects what investors are willing to pay for each unit of earnings given its regulated returns, capital intensity and cash flow profile.</p> <p>Here, the stock is described as expensive versus its immediate peer average P/E of 4.2x. It is also framed as good value against the Asian Electric Utilities average of 17.6x and a fair P/E estimate of 9.5x, suggesting the market is pricing its earnings materially lower than the level that model implies it could move towards.</p> <p>Relative to the broader JP market P/E of 15.6x, the 4.4x P/E is also much lower, which again underlines how compressed the multiple looks compared with both domestic equities and the sector wide context.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Hokkaido Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 4.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still need to weigh regulatory changes or project delays at Ishikariwan Shinko that could affect earnings, cash flows, and how reliable that P/E looks.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Hokkaido Electric Power Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points the other way</h2> <p>While the 4.4x P/E suggests room to move closer to the 9.5x fair ratio, our DCF model is more conservative.

The latest results show narrower losses and modest revenue growth, but the key near term catalyst remains whether Claritev can keep reducing losses while stabilizing its balance sheet. The biggest risk is still its dependence on a few large payor and TPA relationships, and this update does not materially change that.</p> <p>The new US$75 million share repurchase program, capped at US$20 million per year through 2030, is the most relevant announcement here. It intersects directly with the near term focus on cost control and cash generation, since buybacks will draw on cash on hand and operating cash flows. For investors, the real test is whether Claritev can support this program while funding ongoing AI, cloud, and international initiatives that underpin its longer term growth catalysts.</p> <p>Yet even with shrinking losses and a buyback in place, investors still need to weigh the concentration risk in Claritev’s largest client contracts and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/healthcare/nyse-ctev/claritev/tkit8a2w-analysts-boost-claritev-valuation-amid-growth-optimism-and-strategic-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Claritev (it's free!)</a></p><p>Claritev's narrative projects $1.0 billion revenue and $90.0 million earnings by 2028.

The 1 year total shareholder return of 36.6% and very large 3 and 5 year total shareholder returns suggest momentum has been building over several years rather than just in the latest rally.</p> <p>If Chartwell’s run has you thinking more broadly about where capital could work hardest next, it may be worth scanning our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4 healthcare AI stocks</a> for fresh ideas across the sector.</p> <p>With Chartwell generating revenue of CA$1.11b and net income of CA$29.41m, and trading only slightly below a CA$23.70 analyst price target, it is worth asking whether there is still a buying opportunity here or whether the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>On the most followed narrative, Chartwell’s fair value comes out at CA$23.05, a touch above the CA$22.22 last close. This puts the focus on what assumptions are doing the heavy lifting.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chartwell's financial results and guidance point to a sustained increase in demand for senior housing, driven by a rapidly growing seniors population and persistent supply constraints, supporting rising occupancy and driving long term revenue and NOI growth. The company is executing on a strategy of acquiring and developing newer, larger, and more operationally efficient properties expected to produce higher occupancy rates, greater per suite NOI, and enhanced margins as lease ups mature.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><em><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></em></p> <p>Curious what sits behind that CA$23.05 figure? The narrative leans on robust top line expansion, firmer margins, and a rich future earnings multiple that is described as anything but conservative.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of CA$23.05 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/q5a1jmtt-senior-housing-demand-will-build-sustained-market-leadership-5fl7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, the picture could change if elevated leverage and refinancing costs squeeze margins, or if higher labour expenses erode the modest profit improvements that analysts are banking on.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/healthcare/tsx-csh.un/chartwell-retirement-residences-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Chartwell Retirement Residences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle: rich sales multiple vs fair ratio</h2> <p>The AI fair value story leans toward modest undervaluation, but the sales multiple tells a different tale. Chartwell trades on a P/S of 6.4x, far above the North American Healthcare industry at 1.2x and peers at 1.3x, and well ahead of its own fair ratio of 3.5x.</p> <p>That gap suggests the market is already paying a premium for future growth. This leaves less room for error if margins, interest costs or occupancy do not line up with expectations.

Right now, the most important near term catalyst is clarity from the accounting probe, because it directly affects confidence in Nidec’s reported margins and cash flows. The biggest risk is that any control weaknesses or legal findings prove deeper than currently known and weigh on profitability.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the latest Q3 earnings beat and upgraded guidance matter because they show progress on margin stabilization in industrial motors and automotive, which sits at the core of the restructuring story. Stronger earnings and cash flow provide more flexibility for Nidec to keep investing in motors for data centers and EVs while absorbing any near term costs related to governance reforms and potential compliance fixes.</p> <p>Yet investors should also be aware that the ongoing trade compliance investigations could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/jp/capital-goods/tse-6594/nidec-shares/ahdigll5-6594-new-arkansas-expansion-will-drive-positive-momentum-into-2027\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Nidec (it's free!)</a></p><p>Nidec's narrative projects ¥2,893.2 billion revenue and ¥247.5 billion earnings by 2028.

It concluded that the MXDA operation would not secure sufficient profit, so investors now face a clearer, though narrower, capital allocation path.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company.</a></p> <p>The decision to shut down the Dutch MXDA project comes after a period of strong share price momentum, with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company’s 30 day share price return of 41.73% and 90 day return of 61.78%, alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 97.88% that outpaces its shorter term moves.</p> <p>If this kind of portfolio reshaping has you looking beyond a single chemicals name, it could be a good moment to scan the market using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> and see what else stands out.</p> <p>With Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company posting strong recent returns yet still trading at a small intrinsic discount, is the MXDA setback already reflected in the share price, or is the market quietly pricing in additional developments?</p> <h2>Preferred Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On our numbers, Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company trades on a P/S of 1.1x, which screens as good value against peers even after the recent share price strength.</p> <p>P/S compares the company’s market value to its revenue and is often used for businesses where earnings are uneven or currently negative. This is the case here, with a reported loss of ¥16,252.0 on revenue of ¥739,862.0.</p> <p>At 1.1x, the market is paying a lower sales multiple than the peer average of 1.8x. This points to a discount on current revenue even though the company is unprofitable and forecast revenue growth of 4.1% a year is slower than the wider JP market forecast of 5.2%.</p> <p>Compared to the JP Chemicals industry average P/S of 0.8x, however, the shares sit at a premium. Our estimated fair P/S of 1x suggests some scope for the multiple to gravitate closer to that level over time if expectations cool or execution disappoints.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the recent loss of ¥16,252 and the board’s willingness to scrap projects that fall short against that small intrinsic discount.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/materials/tse-4182/mitsubishi-gas-chemical-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another angle, our DCF model</h2> <p>While the 1.1x P/S ratio suggests Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company is only slightly ahead of our fair ratio, our DCF model points to a different angle.

The latest quarter’s US$60.33 million in revenue and US$37.48 million in net income, alongside 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million, supports that tower-focused story, but the key near term risk remains execution on this pivot and the durability of carrier demand rather than the recent handset or retail wireless headlines, which are not especially material here.</p> <p>Among recent developments, management’s 2026 revenue guidance of US$200 million to US$215 million stands out as the clearest reference point for the new tower-heavy model. It effectively replaces the prior wireless service metrics as the main yardstick many investors will watch against Array’s current valuation and income profile. How consistently the company delivers within or above that range, and how that ties to tower lease activity with carriers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, is likely to shape near term sentiment around the stock.</p> <p>Yet beneath this clearer tower story, investors should still be aware that...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/telecom/nyse-ad/array-digital-infrastructure/m7bdsy5m-t-mobile-deal-and-tower-agreements-will-drive-digital-infrastructure-transition\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Array Digital Infrastructure (it's free!)</a></p><p>Array Digital Infrastructure’s narrative projects $3.6 billion in revenue and $173.7 million in earnings by 2028.

The key short term catalyst is execution on its US$3.10 billion capital plan, including projects like Badger Wind, while the biggest risk remains cost recovery and regulatory outcomes on that spending. The latest dividend affirmation and Corvex’s exit do not materially change that risk reward balance in the near term.</p> <p>The reaffirmed quarterly dividend of US$0.14 per share, with a 60% to 70% long term payout target, is the most relevant recent announcement here. It ties directly into the capital plan narrative, because sustaining that payout while funding US$3.10 billion of projects will likely depend on MDU’s ability to manage leverage, avoid equity dilution, and secure timely rate relief that supports earnings and cash flows from its regulated base.</p> <p>Yet beneath this steady dividend story, investors should be aware of the growing risk that rising capital needs and cost of capital could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nyse-mdu/mdu-resources-group/wewrhkcw-analyst-commentary-highlights-upgraded-targets-and-mixed-outlook-for-mdu-resources-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on MDU Resources Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>MDU Resources Group's narrative projects $2.0 billion revenue and $233.0 million earnings by 2028.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nyse-mdu/mdu-resources-group/wewrhkcw-analyst-commentary-highlights-upgraded-targets-and-mixed-outlook-for-mdu-resources-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover how MDU Resources Group's forecasts yield a $20.80 fair value</a>, in line with its current price.</p><h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-mdu/mdu-resources-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MDU 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b72c7a56-cc45-4ee0-92bb-be1fd7c6626c/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MDU 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>While the consensus sees measured progress, the most optimistic analysts were already assuming revenue of about US$2.1 billion and earnings near US$224 million by 2028, so this latest capital plan and guidance could either reinforce or challenge those higher expectations depending on how you view the added regulatory and financing risks.</p><p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/utilities/nyse-mdu/mdu-resources-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore 3 other fair value estimates on MDU Resources Group</a> - why the stock might be worth 10% less than the current price!</p><h2>Decide For Yourself</h2><p>Disagree with existing narratives?

This suggests that momentum has been building over both shorter and longer horizons.</p> <p>If Mazda’s recent move has you looking across the market, it could be a good moment to scan our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_founder_led\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/jp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12 top founder-led companies</a> as potential next ideas.</p> <p>With Mazda trading at ¥1,388.5 versus an average analyst target of ¥1,311.14 and an intrinsic value estimate suggesting an 8.07% premium, you need to ask whether there is still a buying opportunity here, or if the market is already pricing in future growth.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 99.6x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Mazda Motor is trading on a P/E of 99.6x, which sits alongside the recent share price of ¥1,388.5 and points to a rich earnings valuation relative to peers.</p> <p>The P/E ratio compares the current share price to earnings per share, so a higher P/E usually reflects the market paying more for each unit of current earnings. For Mazda, that high multiple sits against low net profit margins of 0.2% and a Return on Equity of 0.5%, which suggests the price is not being anchored by recent profitability.</p> <p>Relative signals back this up. Mazda is described as expensive versus the Asian Auto industry average P/E of 19.3x, and also high compared to the peer average P/E of 55.5x. Against an estimated fair P/E of 30.8x, the current 99.6x multiple is well above the level our models indicate the market could move towards if expectations cooled.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7261/mazda-motor-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Mazda Motor</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 99.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, the high 99.6x P/E multiple, based on net income of ¥8,790 on revenue of ¥4,830,973 and a value score of 0, could limit upside if sentiment cools.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-7261/mazda-motor-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Mazda Motor narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Cash Flows Tell a Similar Story</h2> <p>If you look at Mazda Motor through our DCF model instead of earnings multiples, the picture does not really soften.

It gives a quick sense of how much investors are paying for each unit of profit. For a mature food business like Nippn, investors often look at this ratio to judge whether they are paying up for stability or getting a lower entry point relative to the sector.</p> <p>According to the data, Nippn is described as “good value” on several fronts. Its P/E of 11.5x is below an estimated “fair” P/E of 12.8x.

The latest full-year 2025 results show higher revenue and net income, with basic EPS up to US$1.37, which helps validate that story after a flatter profit track record. The affirmed US$0.09 quarterly dividend reinforces a message of stability rather than signaling any major shift in capital allocation, so it is unlikely to change the near term catalysts in a material way. Instead, the more immediate focus remains on how the company manages input costs, protects margins, and justifies a relatively rich earnings multiple after a strong 12‑month total return. The recent results support confidence, but they also raise the bar for expectations.</p> However, that higher valuation makes any stumble on margins or demand more painful for shareholders to absorb.\nTootsie Roll Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 10%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-tr/tootsie-roll-industries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/9f8185b7-359c-4591-99fd-ca67babeda42/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Simply Wall St Community members currently offer just one fair value view at about US$38.53, giving you a single reference point rather than a broad range of opinions.

The latest results reinforce that 2025 was a record year, but the asset impairment and continued supply chain constraints do not materially change the near term catalyst, which remains execution on growth projects without eroding margins, nor the key risk around capital intensity and equipment availability.</p> <p>The pending acquisition of Distributed Power Solutions is the most relevant update here, because it extends Kodiak’s contracted horsepower model into power generation right as management is working through long equipment lead times. If DPS integrates smoothly and Kodiak secures enough new units on acceptable terms, the combination could support revenue and earnings growth, but any misstep on procurement or deployment timing would feed directly into the existing risk around capital intensity and potential overcapacity.</p> <p>Yet beneath Kodiak’s record 2025 numbers, investors should still be watching how its highly capital intensive model copes with...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/energy/nyse-kgs/kodiak-gas-services/cieb1ckz-permian-basin-and-lng-exports-will-unlock-future-opportunities-gevd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Kodiak Gas Services (it's free!)</a></p><p>Kodiak Gas Services' narrative projects $1.5 billion revenue and $293.4 million earnings by 2028.
