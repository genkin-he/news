Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is about 9.5% overvalued, which is a relatively small gap and suggests expectations and the cash flow outlook are broadly aligned.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>NVIDIA is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

It helps you compare the share price with the company’s profit today, without getting too deep into complex models.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more conservative P/E range.</p> <p>NVIDIA currently trades on a P/E of 35.86x. That sits below the Semiconductor industry average of 43.84x and well below the peer average of 87.49x, which indicates the stock is priced more cautiously than many direct peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for NVIDIA is 54.79x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/E might be appropriate given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. Because it weighs these company specific drivers, the Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with broad industry or peer averages.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 35.86x with the Fair Ratio of 54.79x suggests the shares trade below that fair range.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/08830e11-eecd-4a85-982d-b0ae1dfd6f7a/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:NVDA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

This can help you decide if the stock now looks expensive, cheap or about in line with the story you believe.</p> <p>For NVIDIA, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA Narratives:</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, each Narrative links a clear story about the business to concrete numbers, so you can see how someone gets from their assumptions to a Fair Value per share. Here is how one bullish and one more cautious view stack up using that framework.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/391kfoxw-nvda-expanding-ai-demand-will-drive-major-data-center-investments-through-2026?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$253.02 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 30.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 30.90%</p> <ul> <li>The consensus style bull Narrative, titled \"NVDA: AI Infrastructure Supercycle Will Drive Multi-Year Data Center Leadership\", centers on NVIDIA as a core supplier for AI infrastructure, with demand coming from hyperscalers, sovereign AI projects and a widening range of industries.</li> <li>It leans on assumptions such as analyst forecasts for revenue to compound, higher profit margins over the next few years, a future P/E of 35.58x and a discount rate of around 10.49% to reach a Fair Value around US$253 per share.</li> <li>The author highlights both supportive factors such as platform leadership and full stack offerings, and risks such as export controls, custom accelerators from large customers, supply chain concentration and energy or regulatory constraints on large scale AI buildouts.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/81hhflx5-enterprise-hardware-segment-to-drive-sales-as-ai-takes-over?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: US$141.74 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to fair value versus the last close of US$177.19: 25.0%</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 17.2%</p> <ul> <li>This Narrative, which applies a Fair Value around US$141.74, still sees NVIDIA well positioned in areas such as data centers, gaming GPUs, automotive platforms and Omniverse, but pairs that view with more conservative long term growth and margin assumptions.</li> <li>The author models a lower net margin of 40%, a future P/E of 60x and revenue growth of 17.2%, while also flagging factors that could restrain the outcome, including competition from AMD and Intel, pricing sensitivity for consumer GPUs, regulatory hurdles for deals and possible supply chain disruption.</li> <li>The update section adds NVLM 1.0 as a possible extra growth angle around open source multimodal models and a wider AI ecosystem, but treats it as upside optionality rather than something that changes the valuation inputs today.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two Narratives frame a realistic range of views that are both grounded in detailed assumptions rather than broad labels like \"cheap\" or \"expensive\".

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Carter's (CRI) has wrapped up FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$925.5 million and basic EPS of US$1.76, alongside net income of US$64.2 million. This puts a clear spotlight on how effectively it is turning sales into profit. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$859.7 million and EPS of US$1.71 in Q4 2024 to US$925.5 million and EPS of US$1.76 in Q4 2025. Trailing twelve month revenue of US$2.9 billion and EPS of US$2.53 set the broader earnings backdrop.

id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 3.2%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, Carter's net profit margin sits at 3.2%, compared with 6.3% a year earlier, and trailing twelve month net income is US$91.8 million on US$2.9b of revenue.</li> <li>Bears argue that margin pressure will stick because tariffs and cost inflation are lifting the effective duty rate into the high 30% range and Carter's is leaning on broad price increases to offset this, which they see as risky for a price sensitive young family customer base.\n    <ul> <li>This concern lines up with the drop in trailing margin from 6.3% to 3.2%, as higher duties and input costs can compress earnings even when revenue, at about US$2.9b, remains relatively stable over the last twelve months.</li> <li>Critics also point to the plan to close about 150 North American stores and reduce office based roles by roughly 15% as a sign the current store fleet and cost base are under pressure, and they question whether planned US$45 million of savings will be enough to offset those headwinds and support higher profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Carter's has seen EPS across 2025 quarters swing from US$0.01 in Q2 to US$1.76 in Q4, and bears are watching whether future cost savings truly reverse the visible squeeze in margins or simply keep earnings roughly in line with recent levels. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/x04win8h-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Carter's Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Revenue Growth Slow, Earnings Forecasts Higher</h2> <ul> <li>Forecasts point to revenue growing around 1.1% per year while earnings are expected to grow about 9.7% per year, compared with five year earnings that have declined roughly 15% per year.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish view think this gap between modest revenue growth and faster earnings growth can hold, because they see several levers working in Carter's favor, including digital channel expansion, store rationalization and product simplification.\n    <ul> <li>They highlight plans to reposition Carter's, OshKosh, Little Planet and Otter Avenue as primary brands on Amazon and other wholesale platforms, which they believe can lift higher value assortments and support Wholesale segment earnings even if total company revenue climbs only a little above the current US$2.9b level.</li> <li>Bulls also point to the planned US$45 million in annual productivity savings and the reduction of 20% to 30% of product choices, arguing that better inventory quality and a more efficient cost base can help translate low single digit revenue growth into the 9.7% earnings growth that is currently projected.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to weigh this slow top line outlook against the earnings growth forecasts, it can help to see how bullish analysts connect Carter's cost actions and channel mix to their longer term story. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/k2mo6ka2-update-for-carters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Carter's Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 13.3x Versus DCF Value</h2> <ul> <li>Carter's trades on a P/E of 13.3x compared with peers at 27.8x and the US Luxury industry at 21x, while a DCF fair value of US$13.94 sits well below the current share price of US$33.39.</li> <li>Consensus style analysis suggests this mix of low relative P/E and a DCF fair value below the market price gives investors two very different signals to weigh, especially when set alongside the long run earnings record.\n    <ul> <li>On one hand, the 13.3x P/E is lower than both peers and the broader US market at 19.6x, which is consistent with the idea that the stock appears inexpensive compared with similar companies even though trailing twelve month EPS is US$2.53 on net income of US$91.8 million.</li> <li>On the other hand, the DCF fair value of US$13.94 and the roughly 15% per year five year earnings decline highlight that, despite the lower P/E, longer term profit trends and cash flow estimates have been weaker, which is why some analysts are more cautious about how much upside is left from here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a

See our full breakdown of the management team's track record and compensation.</a></p> <p>For you as an investor, this CEO change sits on top of several moving pieces for Kroger. Greg Foran brings large scale grocery and general merchandise experience from Walmart, which could be relevant as Kroger tightens its cost base, simplifies its structure, and closes underperforming locations. Those are sensitive moves in a low margin business where peers like Walmart, Costco, and Target are also pushing hard on price, private label, and e-commerce. At the same time, Kroger is investing in health focused offerings such as GLP-1 support programs and dietitian services, and continues to face mixed analyst views, including a recent downgrade to Equal Weight and lowered price target. The combination of leadership overhaul, restructuring and varied external opinions means execution and communication from the new CEO may matter more to how you interpret short and medium term developments.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kroger Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>Foran’s appointment could support the existing narrative around tighter cost controls, automation, and store footprint review, as he has experience managing large store networks and operational efficiency at scale.</li> <li>Restructuring, store closures, and a leadership change after a board investigation may challenge earlier assumptions that cost optimization and store expansion would progress smoothly without governance or cultural friction.</li> <li>The increased focus on GLP-1 medication programs and broader wellness offerings is only partly reflected in the existing narrative and may add another dimension to Kroger’s health focused positioning over time.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/blqx7z7z-e-commerce-expansion-and-health-focus-will-strengthen-future-szdj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kroger</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Leadership turnover following a board investigation introduces uncertainty around culture, retention, and the pace of operational changes.</li> <li>⚠️ Store closures, restructuring, and heavy investment in digital and supply chain projects could pressure margins and free cash flow if benefits take longer than expected.</li> <li>🎁 Foran’s large format retail and grocery background may help align store portfolio, pricing, and operations with what has worked at other scale retailers.</li> <li>🎁 Kroger’s push into health and wellness services, including GLP-1 support, provides an additional way to differentiate versus competitors while using existing pharmacy and food infrastructure.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on how quickly the new CEO sets out a clear plan for Kroger’s store footprint, cost base, and digital priorities, and whether that plan stays consistent through the upcoming earnings cycle.

The latest US$775.67 million equity raise via a forward sale slots directly into that story: it helps fund the planned US$38.00 billion of grid and clean‑energy infrastructure spending while also easing pressure on an already leveraged balance sheet. In the near term, that likely means the key catalysts remain regulatory decisions, execution on capital projects and continued dividend progression, while the main trade‑off is incremental dilution for existing shareholders. With the shares recently trading a little above consensus fair value and analysts broadly neutral, the offering itself does not look like a thesis‑changing event, but it does sharpen focus on funding costs, outage performance and future rate outcomes.</p> However, investors should be aware of how repeated equity raises could affect long term returns.\n\nConsolidated Edison's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-ed/consolidated-edison\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/721aa817-6bdd-4ca3-aa2e-3117a6b10b23/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ED 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Two Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates cluster tightly around US$105 to US$108, hinting at limited perceived mispricing.

Over the last six reported quarters, revenue has moved in a tight band between US$611.1 million and US$642.5 million while quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$0.05 to a high of US$1.00, reflecting shifting earnings power that puts the focus firmly on how durable its margins really are.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Globant.</a> <p>With the latest figures on the table, the next step is to see how these margins and earnings trends line up with the most widely discussed narratives around Globant’s growth and risk profile, and where the numbers push back on those stories.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Globant</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:GLOB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/25169e8c-4bb6-4a30-aa44-565362b099c5/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:GLOB Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Under Pressure At 4.2% Net Level</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, Globant converted US$2.5b of revenue into US$102.9 million of net income excluding extra items, which works out to a 4.2% net margin versus 6.9% a year earlier.</li> <li>Bears highlight the margin squeeze as a core concern, and the trailing numbers give them some support:\n    <ul> <li>The Q2 2025 quarter even showed a small loss, with net income excluding extra items of US$2.4 million on US$614.2 million of revenue. This lines up with worries about earnings sensitivity when growth slows.</li> <li>At the same time, trailing revenue stayed close to US$2.5b. The drop from a 6.9% to 4.2% net margin is therefore more about profitability than demand collapsing, which is exactly the pressure point bears focus on rather than a volume shock.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Globant's thinner 4.2% net margin and that Q2 loss are exactly the kind of numbers bears point to when they argue the business model is under pressure. It is worth seeing how that squares with a full Bear Case view in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/uppr7toe-ai-and-geopolitical-risks-will-limit-demand-yet-offer-hope-havg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Globant Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>One Off US$73.3m Loss Clouds Earnings Trend</h2> <ul> <li>The last 12 months included a one off loss of US$73.3 million, which weighed on the reported net income of US$102.9 million and on the 4.2% net margin figure investors are looking at today.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this large item masks the underlying earnings power, and the data gives them some talking points:\n    <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, three of the four quarters were profitable on a net income excluding extra items basis, adding up to US$102.9 million despite the drag from the one off. Bulls see this as more reflective of the ongoing run rate than the headline margin alone.</li> <li>Analysts in the bullish camp also point to forecast earnings growth of about 21.6% per year from this base, so they treat the US$73.3 million charge as a temporary hit rather than a permanent change in the business model that would keep margins at 4.2%.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Bulls see that US$73.3 million one off charge as a speed bump rather than a reset of long term profitability, which is a key pillar of the Bull Case set out in <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1hiaw3fa-ai-and-cloud-native-solutions-will-transform-global-work-models-zxut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Globant Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>P/E Of 21.3x And DCF Fair Value Gap</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$49.76, Globant trades on a P/E of 21.3x, slightly above the 18.2x peer average and roughly in line with the US IT industry at 21x, while the supplied DCF fair value of US$101.78 sits well above the current price.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about a mixed risk and reward setup, and the current numbers show why views are split:\n    <ul> <li>On one side, the DCF fair value of US$101.78 implies a large gap to the share price. This lines up with the idea that the market may be underpricing the 21.6% forecast earnings growth even though revenue is only expected to grow about 4.7% per year.</li> <li>On the other, the higher than peer P/E together with a trailing net margin of 4.2% means today’s valuation is being asked to sit on top of relatively modest profitability. This is exactly what more cautious investors focus on when they question how much of that growth is already reflected in the multiple.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/pox0vsv5-analysts-cut-globant-valuation-amid-it-services-challenges-and-mixed-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Globant on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of bullish and cautious signals leaves you on the fence, act while the data is fresh and weigh it against your own expectations, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-glob/globant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>Globant’s thinner 4.2% net margin, a recent quarterly loss and a one off US$73.3 million charge all raise questions about the consistency of its earnings power.</p> <p>If you are uneasy about paying up for that kind of earnings volatility, it is worth checking our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">76 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> to focus on companies with more stable profiles right now.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The gap between these two is the Excess Return, calculated at SEK16.19 per share, which is what this approach treats as value created over and above the required return.</p> <p>The Stable Book Value used in the model is SEK201.21 per share, sourced from weighted future Book Value estimates from 4 analysts. Combining these inputs produces an Excess Returns intrinsic value of roughly SEK569 per share. Compared with the recent share price of SEK347.8, this framework points to the stock trading at a 38.9% discount, which screens as undervalued on this method.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Swedbank is undervalued by 38.9%.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can justify a higher “normal” P/E, while slower expected growth or higher risk tend to pull a fair P/E lower.</p> <p>Swedbank currently trades on a P/E of 11.92x. That sits slightly above the Banks industry average of 11.09x and also above the peer group average of 11.49x, so on simple comparisons the shares are not screening as cheap. To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 12.02x for Swedbank. This is the P/E level suggested after factoring in elements like its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a straight peer or industry comparison because it is tailored to the company rather than relying on broad group averages.</p> <p>Set against the current P/E of 11.92x, the Fair Ratio of 12.02x is very close, which points to the shares being priced roughly in line with this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d68ba17d-9030-4dd5-bcd5-1c64af8b3dbf/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OM:SWED A P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about Swedbank linked to concrete numbers like your own fair value, revenue, earnings and margin assumptions. All of these are updated in real time on Simply Wall St’s Community page as new news or results arrive. This way you can instantly see how your Fair Value compares to the current price and decide whether the share looks appealing, whether you prefer a cautious view closer to SEK 213.52 per share or a more optimistic stance around SEK 390 per share.</p> <p>For Swedbank, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Swedbank Narratives:</p> <p>First is a more optimistic take that leans toward a higher fair value and assumes that Swedbank can keep turning its retail and corporate banking footprint into steady business across Sweden and the Baltics.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/pvtd2lw8-long-term-digital-and-sustainability-trends-will-support-a-stronger-banking-franchise?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Swedbank Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 390.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this narrative: 10.8% below the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 5.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish view is based on Swedbank executing on its 15/27 plan, using stronger customer engagement and tighter cost control to support earnings through a lower cost to income ratio.</li> <li>It also relies on steady volume growth in core lending, including Swedish mortgages and Baltic lending, together with rising contributions from savings, pensions and asset management fees.</li> <li>This narrative assumes investors will be comfortable with Swedbank trading on a future P/E of 14.6x on 2029 earnings, with earnings projected at SEK 36.0b and a discount rate of 6.24% used to bring those numbers back to today.</li> </ul> <p>The second is a more cautious narrative that points to a lower fair value and focuses on what happens if interest income and revenue do not keep pace with current expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"/se/banks/sto-swed-a/swedbank-shares/d2z4fsdh-swedbank-kommer-oka-langsiktigt-tack-vare-hogkonjuktur?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Swedbank Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: SEK 213.52 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this narrative: 62.8% above the narrative fair value, based on the last close of SEK 347.80</p> <p>Revenue growth assumption: 6.0% per year</p> <ul> <li>This bearish view starts from the idea that Swedish mortgage rates could settle nearer 3% from around 4.5%, which would feed through to lower interest income from mortgages and a smaller total revenue base.</li> <li>In this scenario, Swedbank’s total revenue moves from SEK 74.4b to SEK 63.0b, partly offset by about 10% growth in other services tied to the policy rate.</li> <li>From there, the narrative outlines a path where revenue recovers over three years to SEK 88.0b, but the starting point is a lower fair value of SEK 213.52 per share, which is based on a future P/E of 7.79 and a higher discount rate of 8.92%.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these two narratives frame the current price between a more optimistic SEK 390.00 view and a more cautious SEK 213.52 view, allowing you to consider which set of assumptions comes closer to how you see Swedbank’s earnings power and risk profile.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $1.08b. Analyst estimates and subsequent extrapolations suggest free cash flow reaching around $1.92b in 2035, with interim projections such as $1.17b in 2026 and $1.39b in 2028. These figures are all expressed in US$ and include both analyst inputs and Simply Wall St extrapolations beyond the typical five year analyst window.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $577 per share, compared with a current share price of roughly $681. That implies the stock is about 18.0% above this particular fair value estimate, based on this model.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Teledyne Technologies may be overvalued by 18.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 47 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TDY Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Teledyne Technologies.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Teledyne Technologies Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Teledyne Technologies, the P/E ratio is a useful yardstick because it links what you pay for the stock to the earnings the business is currently generating. In general, higher growth expectations or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justify a lower, more conservative multiple.</p> <p>Teledyne’s current P/E is about 35.25x, compared with the Electronic industry average of around 27.59x and a peer average of roughly 60.93x. To give a more tailored view, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 24.68x for Teledyne, which is the P/E level it might trade on given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio aims to be more useful than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it is specific to Teledyne’s own mix of growth, risks and profitability. Relative to that Fair Ratio of 24.68x, the current P/E of 35.25x is higher by a clear margin, suggesting the shares are pricing in richer terms than this model implies.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-tdy/teledyne-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/2cf6a5f6-c6d5-4192-890e-61a491757215/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:TDY P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>MBIA (MBI) has just closed out FY 2025 with fourth quarter revenue of US$13 million and a basic EPS loss of US$1.01, alongside net income from ongoing operations showing a loss of US$50 million. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$26 million in Q4 2024 through US$33 million and negative US$43 million in early 2024 to US$21 million, US$15 million, then US$13 million in 2025. Quarterly basic EPS has ranged from a loss of US$5.33 in Q2 2024 to losses of US$1.28, US$0.14 and US$1.01 across 2025, setting up a story where investors are likely to focus on how efficiently MBIA is managing its shrinking top line against persistent losses and what that implies for margins.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for MBIA.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to weigh them against the most widely held narratives around MBIA, to see which stories the latest results support and which ones the data starts to challenge.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/4it2jeai-update-for-mbia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about MBIA</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/insurance/nyse-mbi/mbia/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/e7562be9-1d4c-489e-b33b-f5446fff2d04/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:MBI Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Running losses still large at US$175 million TTM</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, MBIA reported total revenue of US$80 million and a net loss from ongoing operations of US$175 million, which works out to basic EPS of US$3.55 in losses.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view talks about earnings reaching US$58.3 million by around 2028 with margins moving from about 188.2% in the red to 64.6% in the black, and the current loss profile sets up a clear test of that path:\n    <ul> <li>The last four reported quarters still show losses in each period, including US$50 million in Q4 2025 and US$62 million in Q1 2025, so any future profit story has to bridge that gap.</li> <li>At the same time, the data shows losses shrinking at about 4.2% per year over five years. This is consistent with a gradual improvement but still far from the earnings level implied in those longer term forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue growth vs flat outlook</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, revenue growth is described at about 8.4% per year. Yet quarterly revenue in the table runs from US$33 million in Q3 2024 to US$13 million in Q4 2025, while analysts assume revenue of US$90.4 million by 2028 that is characterized as fairly flat over the next three years.</li> <li>What is interesting for the bullish narrative is how that 8.4% revenue growth rate lines up with assumptions that revenue stays fairly flat, even as bulls expect higher margins to carry future earnings:\n    <ul> <li>The consensus narrative ties a lot of the potential upside to margin improvement rather than big new premium growth. This fits with comments about the insured portfolio running off and limiting future revenue expansion.</li> <li>Given that the insured par at National is described as shrinking and leverage sits at 23 to 1, bulls are effectively leaning on cost control and better outcomes on legacy exposures rather than a jump in top line to support those margin targets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you want to see how those margin assumptions stack up against MBIA's latest numbers, have a look at <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MBIA Bull Case</strong></a> for the full bull case.\n\n<h2>Premium P/S, mixed valuation signals</h2> <ul> <li>MBIA trades on a P/S of 4.1x compared with about 1.2x for the wider US insurance group and roughly 1.0x for peers. A DCF fair value of about US$34.47 in the supplied data sits well above the current share price of US$6.55 and the analyst price target of US$7.75.</li> <li>Bears focus on that valuation gap by pointing out that the premium P/S multiple is coming alongside negative shareholders' equity and ongoing losses, which leaves little room for disappointment if forecasts do not play out as expected:\n    <ul> <li>The company is still unprofitable on a trailing 12 month basis and has negative equity flagged in the risk summary, so the balance sheet is not yet reflecting the DCF fair value figure or the US$58.3 million earnings level assumed for 2028.</li> <li>With the analyst price target only about 18% above the current US$6.55 share price, skeptics can argue that the market is already cautious, even as the DCF fair value number suggests a much larger gap that depends heavily on that future profit recovery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical about whether those losses and balance sheet issues justify a premium P/S?
