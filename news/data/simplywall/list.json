With Gucci facing a reset, the group is looking more closely at how each house contributes to its overall profile at a time when demand for high end products is less buoyant than in recent years.</p> <p>For you as an investor, the focus now is on how Kering balances Gucci’s turnaround efforts with the growing visibility of its other brands. The way the group allocates attention and resources across its portfolio could influence its resilience to changes in consumer spending in its core regions.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-ker/kering-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kering</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

As Gucci works through a repositioning, management is effectively asking the rest of the portfolio to carry more weight. For you, the key question is whether houses like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta can deepen their identity without diluting group focus or stretching creative and operational resources at a time when luxury demand is less buoyant.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Kering Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The increased emphasis on multiple houses lines up with the narrative of product refreshes and store optimization. These are aimed at sharpening brand positioning and improving operating leverage over time.</li> <li>Execution risk at Gucci and other brands, already highlighted in the narrative, is reinforced by this reset. More creative shifts and portfolio changes raise the chance that some collections or market bets do not resonate with consumers.</li> <li>The current news focuses on brand mix and positioning, while the narrative also points to factors like tourism trends and secondhand luxury, which may not be fully reflected in how investors interpret this reset.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/14mdfsvn-ker-beauty-unit-sale-and-licensing-deal-will-shape-future-market-position\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Kering</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Execution risk around Gucci’s repositioning and other creative shifts, which could affect demand if new collections do not connect with core and aspirational buyers.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts have flagged that Kering’s interest payments are not well covered by earnings. This can limit flexibility if trading conditions stay soft or turn weaker.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts expect earnings to grow strongly over the coming years. This suggests upside if Kering’s portfolio reset and cost discipline play out as planned.</li> <li>🎁 A stronger role for brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta could reduce reliance on a single label and help Kering compete more evenly with peers such as LVMH and Hermès.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth watching how quickly Gucci’s refreshed positioning shows up in product traction, pricing, and brand heat, especially with US aspirational shoppers. You can also track whether Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and other houses gain more visibility in key regions without eroding Kering’s overall margin profile. Competitive moves from large groups like LVMH and Richemont on pricing, store openings, and marketing will give extra context for how Kering’s choices are landing with luxury consumers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Kering, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/ENXTPA/KER\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> community page for Kering</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

However, the 1 year total shareholder return of 12.20% and very large 5 year total shareholder return suggest longer term holders have still seen strong gains.

The narrative leans heavily on projected earnings growth, future margins and a richer P/E multiple than the sector.</p> <p>Analysts in this narrative apply an 8.63% discount rate to future cash flows and earnings, assume a gentle revenue drift, and still land on a higher earnings base than today. They also build in a future profit multiple that is well above typical metals and mining levels, implying the market would need to pay up for Stanmore Resources if these assumptions hold.</p> <p>Put simply, this most popular view sees today’s share price as leaving a gap to fair value, but that gap depends on those revenue, margin and multiple assumptions playing out over time.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of A$3.20 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6tyv7dqw-indian-urbanization-and-low-capex-projects-will-boost-seaborne-coal-demand-ksp1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, this depends on coal prices and regulatory approvals.

These figures raise fair questions about what is already priced in and how risk is being viewed.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Ubiquiti has focused on its role in networking and wireless equipment markets, as investors look for companies with established product ecosystems and recognizable brands. This context helps frame why the stock has attracted attention alongside its recent price performance.</li> <li>On our valuation checks Ubiquiti scores 1 out of 6, indicating it appears undervalued on only one of the six metrics we use.

The latest twelve months Free Cash Flow is reported at about US$699 million. Simply Wall St then extends this with cash flow projections out to 2035, starting with an estimate of US$663.2 million in 2026 and US$743.3 million in 2035, with intermediate years in between. Analysts typically provide forecasts for up to five years, so the later years are extrapolated from earlier trends.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$197.14 per share. With the recent share price at US$755.43, this particular model implies the stock is very expensive relative to its cash flow estimate, with an intrinsic discount indicating it is about 283.2% above the DCF value.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ubiquiti may be overvalued by 283.2%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>UI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Ubiquiti.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Ubiquiti Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For a profitable company like Ubiquiti, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you are paying directly to the earnings the business is currently generating.</p> <p>What counts as a normal or fair P/E depends on how the market views the company’s growth potential and risk. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually justifies a lower one.</p> <p>Ubiquiti currently trades on a P/E of 51.45x. That sits above the Communications industry average P/E of about 40.47x, yet below the peer group average of 77.85x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 36.24x for Ubiquiti, which is an estimate of the P/E that would fit its specific earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for company specific qualities instead of assuming that all businesses in a sector should trade at similar multiples.</p> <p>Comparing Ubiquiti’s actual P/E of 51.45x with the Fair Ratio of 36.24x suggests the shares are pricing in more optimism than the model supports.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives. Discover our 21 top founder-led companies</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Ubiquiti Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your own story about a company linked directly to your assumptions for fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St, Narratives live inside the Community page and give you a straightforward way to connect what you believe about Ubiquiti’s business to a financial forecast and then to a fair value estimate that you can compare with today’s share price.</p> <p>Because Narratives sit on the platform used by millions of investors, you can see how others frame the same numbers, and the system keeps those Narratives updated when new information such as earnings reports or major news is added, so your fair value view stays current without extra effort.</p> <p>For example, one Ubiquiti Narrative might assume more modest revenue growth and lower long term profit margins, while another might expect stronger growth and higher margins. These different assumptions can lead to very different fair values and therefore very different views on whether the current US$755.43 price looks attractive or stretched.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ubiquiti? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/UI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nyse-ui/ubiquiti\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5e5f0b68-c0ff-4b56-8656-fae28f721586/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:UI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Pulse Biosciences at around US$19.21 is priced fairly or if the market is getting ahead of itself, this article walks through what the numbers indicate about its value.</li> <li>The share price has had a mixed run, with a 24.5% decline over the last week, a 34.1% gain over the last month, a 43.5% gain year to date, a 0.7% decline over the last year, a very large 3 year return of around 7x, and a 30.8% decline over five years.</li> <li>Recent news coverage around Pulse Biosciences has focused on its position in the healthcare space and shifting investor expectations. This helps explain why the share price has moved sharply over different time frames. This context matters, because changing sentiment can affect how investors weigh potential future outcomes against the current share price.</li> <li>Right now, our valuation model gives Pulse Biosciences a value score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. Next, we will look at how different valuation approaches view the stock, and then finish with a more complete way to think about what that means for you as an investor.</li> </ul> <p>Pulse Biosciences scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

This process arrives at an estimate of what the business might be worth now.</p> <p>For Pulse Biosciences, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on projected free cash flows in dollars. The latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of about $54.7 million. Analyst and extrapolated estimates in the model show cash flows staying negative in the near term, then turning positive by 2030, with projected free cash flow of $10 million in that year. Further out, the model extends these projections through 2035 using estimated growth rates.</p> <p>After discounting all those projected cash flows, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $2.62 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $19.21, this DCF output suggests the stock is very expensive relative to the cash flows assumed in the model, or in other words, very overvalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Pulse Biosciences may be overvalued by 633.7%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>PLSE Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Pulse Biosciences.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Pulse Biosciences Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies that are not yet producing consistent profits, P/B is often more useful than P/E because it compares the share price with the accounting value of net assets rather than earnings that may still be negative or volatile.</p> <p>In general, a higher multiple is easier to justify when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while a lower multiple tends to reflect more modest expectations or higher uncertainty. That is why context matters when you look at any headline ratio.</p> <p>Pulse Biosciences currently trades on a P/B of about 16.19x. This sits above the Medical Equipment industry average P/B of about 2.44x and also above the peer group average of around 3.21x. Simply Wall St also uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for the preferred multiple, which estimates what a reasonable P/B might be after considering factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>Because the Fair Ratio is tailored to the company, it can give a more focused view than a simple comparison with industry or peer averages. In this case, the actual 16.19x P/B sits above the Fair Ratio used in the model, which points to the shares trading on a richer multiple than that framework would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives, where you write your own story for Pulse Biosciences by linking your expectations for revenue, earnings and margins to a forecast, a fair value and a clear comparison of that fair value with today’s price. This is all within an easy Community tool that millions of investors use, and that automatically updates when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might set a higher fair value around US$30 based on a very optimistic view of thyroid and cardiac adoption, while another might use a lower fair value around US$22 based on more moderate assumptions. You can immediately see how far each view sits from the current price to help you decide what you want to do.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Pulse Biosciences? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqCM/PLSE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-plse/pulse-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7900ed03-6abe-4aba-9042-cb7f3f3204fc/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqCM:PLSE 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The recent share pullback ahead of the March 4, 2026 earnings release does not materially change the near term catalyst, which remains the upcoming earnings print, or the key risk around margin pressure from funding costs and lower transaction yields.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the series of special cash dividends of US$0.12 per share across 2025 and into early 2026 stands out in this context. These payouts, alongside a regular dividend at the PagBank level, sit directly across from concerns that capital returns and buybacks could constrain reinvestment at a time when competition, PIX adoption, and shifting client mix are already putting pressure on revenue per transaction and long term growth capacity.

The Renergen acquisition and production update put execution at the Virginia project front and center, with management openly targeting positive operational cash flow by late 2026. In that context, the Emerging Growth Virtual Conference appearance looks more like an investor-relations catalyst than a fundamental one: helpful for shaping the story, but unlikely on its own to change near-term cash burn, project timing, or balance sheet risk. With a volatile share price, rich price to book, and expectations of high revenue growth, the bigger questions still sit around delivering on operational milestones and managing funding needs without further eroding existing shareholders.</p> However, there is one financing and dilution risk here that investors really should understand.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on ASP Isotopes</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-aspi/asp-isotopes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/8686b2df-74f7-4596-899d-4091f07eee9a/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ASPI 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> You are seeing ten different fair value views from the Simply Wall St Community, ranging from well under US$1 to very large upside estimates above US$70.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings at around US$253.37 still offers value after a strong run, you are not alone.</li> <li>The stock has returned 2.7% over the last 7 days, 15.8% over 30 days, 44.8% year to date and 113.5% over 1 year, with a very large 3 year and 5 year return of 268.1% and 300.7% respectively. This naturally raises questions about what is already priced in.</li> <li>These moves have kept MACOM in focus as investors reassess where it fits within the wider semiconductor space and what current optimism implies for future expectations. Recent coverage has largely revolved around its positioning in the sector and whether its share price performance is aligned with its fundamentals.</li> <li>Despite this strong share price history, MACOM currently scores 0 out of 6 on our valuation checks, as shown in our <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation scorecard</a>.

It focuses on the cash the business may generate for shareholders rather than accounting earnings.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company’s latest twelve month free cash flow is about $151.8 million. Analysts provide explicit free cash flow estimates out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further figures out to 2035, including a projected free cash flow of $945.6 million in 2035.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the DCF model produces an estimated intrinsic value of about $114.39 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $253.37, this output suggests the stock is 121.5% above this particular estimate of intrinsic value based on the model’s cash flow scenario.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings may be overvalued by 121.5%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 53 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>MTSI Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies, the P/E ratio is a useful way to think about value because it links what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. A higher P/E can reflect stronger expected growth or lower perceived risk, while a lower P/E can point to more muted growth expectations or higher uncertainty.</p> <p>MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings is trading on a P/E of 117.26x. That sits well above the Semiconductor industry average of 44.48x and also above the peer average of 39.25x. On the surface, that kind of gap suggests investors are paying a much higher price for each dollar of earnings than is typical for the sector or for similar companies.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for MACOM, at 38.30x, is designed to be a more tailored yardstick than a simple peer or industry comparison. It incorporates factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, margins, size and risk characteristics, then estimates what would be a reasonable P/E given those inputs. Because it looks at company specific drivers as well as its sector and market cap, it aims to be a more rounded guide to what might be considered a balanced valuation range.</p> <p>Comparing the current P/E of 117.26x with the Fair Ratio of 38.30x points to MACOM trading well above that model based assessment.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/80e6a163-da33-4131-98b3-def798d1b0d6/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:MTSI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Another might lean toward the more cautious US$160.00 fair value with 14.65% annual revenue growth, a 28.48% profit margin and a future P/E of 40.08x. By comparing each Narrative’s fair value with the current share price you can see which story, if any, lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>For MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Narratives:</p> <p>Each one takes the same business data and applies a different set of expectations, so you can quickly see which assumptions feel closer to your own view.</p> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/i4lpvwos-ai-and-5g-demand-will-shape-future-semiconductor-landscape-02wu?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$255.73</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 0.9% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 16.75% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bullish case leans on MACOM’s exposure to AI, 5G, data center and SATCOM demand, with those end markets expected to support revenue growth and higher margins over time.</li> <li>It assumes that operational work at the RTP fab and across the manufacturing footprint eventually supports higher gross and operating margins, while R&amp;D and M&amp;A are used to support new optical and RF products.</li> <li>The fair value of about US$255.73 reflects those growth and margin expectations, together with a future P/E assumption and a discount rate of 10.53%, and sits close to where the shares most recently traded.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-mtsi/macom-technology-solutions-holdings/91okis49-update-for-macom-technology-solutions-holdings?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$160.00</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value at the last close of US$253.37: about 58.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue growth used in this narrative: 14.65% per year</p> <ul> <li>The bearish case focuses on execution and cycle risks, highlighting MACOM’s reliance on data center optical ramps, carrier capex and defense programs, and the possibility that new fab capacity is underutilized.</li> <li>It assumes revenue still grows and margins improve, but that the market may be assigning too high a P/E multiple relative to those earnings, especially if product ramps or customer programs are slower than expected.</li> <li>The fair value of US$160.00 is based on those more cautious assumptions and sits well below the recent share price, which implies that expectations embedded in the current price are demanding in this scenario.</li> </ul> <p>Putting these side by side shows how much the outcome for MACOM depends on your confidence in future growth, margin progress and capital deployment. If you want to go deeper into the reasoning and tweak the assumptions yourself, the full community Narratives for MACOM let you stress test both the bullish and bearish versions and see how your own fair value compares with today’s price.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Exelon, through its regulated utility operations, is closely tied to how regional transmission is planned and built. PJM decisions can shape where future capital spending flows across the system.</p> <p>The approved project points to more attention on long distance transmission as a way to connect customers with diverse generation sources over time.

A long distance, multi state project of this size can expand Exelon’s rate base exposure to transmission, an area many utilities view as core to meeting rising load from data centers, industrial electrification and clean energy projects. At the same time, management has recently tapped the bond market with US$775 million of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2036, which could help fund large scale infrastructure or refinance existing debt. That combination of new capex needs and additional long term debt keeps the spotlight on execution, cost recovery and interest coverage over the next decade.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Exelon Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The PJM backed project aligns with the narrative that growing electricity demand and supportive state policies are expanding Exelon’s grid investment opportunities through larger transmission build outs.</li> <li>Rising capital requirements for projects like this line can pressure Exelon’s balance sheet and increase its dependence on constructive regulatory outcomes, which is already flagged as a key risk.</li> <li>The competitive PJM award alongside a partner such as NextEra Energy Transmission (a unit of NextEra Energy) may not be fully captured in earlier commentary on Exelon’s transmission pipeline and could influence how future project wins are assessed versus peers such as Duke Energy or American Electric Power.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/2shlamqo-electric-infrastructure-will-expand-as-demand-and-regulatory-stability-shape-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Exelon</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Large, multi state projects increase execution and regulatory risk if timelines slip or cost recovery is slower than expected, and analysts have flagged interest coverage as a concern.</li> <li>⚠️ Additional long term debt such as the 4.95% notes due 2036 adds to fixed interest obligations, which can limit flexibility if operating conditions or rate decisions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A PJM approved, high voltage line supports Exelon’s position in long haul transmission, an area that can offer regulated returns as demand for grid capacity grows.</li> <li>🎁 The project is intended to support reliability and affordability for customers, which aligns with Exelon’s customer first initiatives, including programs to manage higher energy bills and protect smaller users from large infrastructure costs.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, it is worth tracking how Exelon and NextEra Energy Transmission advance permitting, community engagement and construction milestones, as any changes could affect cost profiles. Keep an eye on how regulators allocate project costs across states and customer classes, given Exelon’s focus on shielding residential and small business customers from large transmission charges. The recent US$775 million note issuance also puts future interest expense and credit metrics in focus.

Over recent periods the company has seen revenue move from US$205.2 million on a trailing basis in Q3 2024 to US$226.7 million in Q4 2024 and then to US$279.5 million by Q4 2025.

However, the margin slip from 51% to 48.5% sits alongside trailing EPS easing from US$2.19 in Q3 2025 to US$1.96 by Q4 2025, which investors can weigh against:\n    <ul> <li>Revenue on a trailing basis rising from US$205.2 million in Q3 2024 to US$279.5 million by Q4 2025, aligning with the idea of solid top line growth.</li> <li>Earnings growth of 17.3% over the past year coming in below the 5 year average of 22.3% per year, which is more muted than the optimistic narrative around resilient long term profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Q4 revenue at US$77.6m and EPS volatility</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, quarterly revenue moved from US$62.7 million in Q1 to US$77.6 million in Q4, while basic EPS ranged between US$0.39 and US$0.63, ending Q4 at US$0.51 compared with US$0.77 in Q4 2024.</li> <li>Bulls point to expanding income sources and strong asset growth to support long term earnings per share. The pattern of quarterly EPS swinging from US$0.43 to US$0.63 then to US$0.39 and US$0.51, alongside net income moving between about US$27.1 million and US$41.4 million in 2025, gives you a reminder that:\n    <ul> <li>Reported earnings can be lumpy quarter to quarter even when the trailing twelve month line shows 17.3% earnings growth.</li> <li>Claims about resilient EPS growth need to be balanced against this intra year volatility when you think about how steady future distributions and reinvestment capacity might be.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On a year like this where revenue keeps building but quarterly EPS jumps around, many bullish investors look beyond a single period and focus on the full story behind future growth and valuation, which you can do by checking out <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Trinity Capital Bull Case</strong></a> for more detail.\n\n<h2>P/E of 8.6x and 44% gap to DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>With a share price of US$15.40, Trinity trades on a trailing P/E of 8.6x, compared with peer and industry averages of 21.4x and 23x, and sits about 44.2% below a DCF fair value of roughly US$27.60.</li> <li>Bears highlight the high proportion of non cash earnings, limited coverage of interest costs and a 13.25% dividend by earnings and free cash flow, as well as recent shareholder dilution. These concerns sit alongside the low P/E and large gap to DCF fair value in a way that:\n    <ul> <li>Supports caution that a simple comparison to peer P/E multiples may not tell the whole story if a chunk of the 48.5% net margin is driven by items that do not translate into cash.</li> <li>Reinforces the idea that a 13.25% yield plus a low multiple is not automatically comfortable when interest and dividends are flagged as not well covered, so the apparent valuation gap to US$27.60 DCF fair value needs to be weighed against these balance sheet and cash coverage pressures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing a low 8.6x P/E against those cash coverage flags, it helps to see how more cautious investors frame the risks, which you can do through <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Trinity Capital Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/hmjlfgj8-tightening-capital-and-vc-pullbacks-will-hurt-credit-quality-ltu4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Trinity Capital on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>On balance, does this mix of growth, volatility and valuation gaps leave you confident or cautious?

The February drill results and launch of a 50,000‑metre program, now guided by Objectivity’s data analytics, slot directly into the near‑term catalysts: an updated Mineral Resource Estimate and further definition of higher‑grade zones that could influence future economic studies. With the share price already up very sharply over the past year and equity financing heavily funding this work, the new assays look directionally supportive rather than thesis‑changing on their own. The bigger swing factors remain resource quality, permitting, and continued access to capital if drilling and studies take longer or cost more than expected.</p> However, investors should also weigh how reliant the story still is on fresh equity funding.\n\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our comprehensive valuation report</a> raises the possibility that Omai Gold Mines is priced higher than what may be justified by its financials.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsxv-omg/omai-gold-mines-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c6b53872-2855-4958-bf1d-0d4b71bd06c8/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSXV:OMG 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> Three Simply Wall St Community valuations span roughly US$9.70 billion to US$97.00 billion, underlining how far opinions can stretch.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering whether Dropbox is a bargain or just fairly priced at its current level? This article walks through what the numbers are saying about the stock's value.</li> <li>Dropbox shares last closed at US$24.43, with returns of a 1.2% decline over 7 days, 7.9% decline over 30 days, 9.3% decline year to date, 5.9% decline over 1 year, 18.2% over 3 years and 6.0% over 5 years, which may have some investors reassessing the balance between opportunity and risk.</li> <li>Recent coverage around Dropbox has focused on its position as a mature cloud storage and collaboration platform and how investors weigh that against other software names. This helps frame the recent share price performance. Alongside that, ongoing discussion about competition in cloud services and productivity tools has kept attention on how much value the market is currently willing to assign to Dropbox.</li> <li>On our framework, Dropbox scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6 valuation score</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about US$928.9 million. Analyst estimates and Simply Wall St extrapolations project free cash flow of roughly US$931.0 million in 2026 and US$1,296.6 million in 2035, with values between those years laid out in the ten year projection set.</p> <p>When all those future cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$59.33 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$24.43, the DCF output suggests the stock trades at a 58.8% discount, which points to Dropbox looking undervalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Dropbox is undervalued by 58.8%.

In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk tend to justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually point to a lower, more cautious multiple.</p> <p>Dropbox currently trades on a P/E of 11.59x. That sits well below the Software industry average of 25.78x and also below the peer group average of 22.86x. To sharpen this comparison, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 20.38x, which is the P/E level the model suggests for Dropbox given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and company specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple industry or peer comparison because it adjusts for Dropbox’s own characteristics instead of assuming it should trade exactly like the average software name. Setting the Fair Ratio of 20.38x against the actual 11.59x P/E implies the shares are pricing in a lower multiple than the model suggests might be appropriate.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:DBX P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/d063deed-e62e-44b0-b653-07cd40ec368f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:DBX P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St you can use Narratives on the Community page to attach your own story about Dropbox to a set of revenue, earnings and margin assumptions, link that story to a fair value, then compare it with the current price to help decide whether you see Dropbox as closer to the higher US$30 or lower US$20 fair value cases. The Narrative automatically updates as new news or earnings arrive so your view stays connected to the latest information rather than a static spreadsheet.</p> <p>For Dropbox, here are previews of two leading Dropbox narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/3dq9x53g-ai-dash-and-hybrid-work-will-redefine-digital-collaboration?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Dropbox Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bullish narrative: US$30.00 per share</p> <p>Implied discount to this fair value: 18.6% below the narrative fair value at the recent US$24.43 share price</p> <p>Revenue trend used in this narrative: 29.8% annual decline</p> <ul> <li>Assumes Dropbox successfully leans into AI led products like Dash and workflow tools for enterprises, supporting higher margins and long term cash generation.</li> <li>Builds in an expectation that share buybacks reduce the share count meaningfully, which supports earnings per share even with a soft revenue trend.</li> <li>Identifies long term potential if management can keep investing in AI tools while holding on to profitability, with churn, competition and a shrinking paid user base as key risks.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/us/software/nasdaq-dbx/dropbox/99qpy6jn-teams-churn-and-ai-delays-will-depress-revenue?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Dropbox Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value in this bearish narrative: US$20.00 per share</p> <p>Implied premium to this fair value: 22.2% above the narrative fair value at the recent US$24.43 share price</p> <p>Revenue trend used in this narrative: 157.2% annual decline</p> <ul> <li>Assumes elevated churn in Teams customers, reduced investment in non core lines and headwinds in outbound sales that keep pressure on revenue and earnings.</li> <li>Treats the shift from mature file storage into AI tools like Dash as a source of execution uncertainty, with slower contribution from new products and sensitivity to currency moves.</li> <li>Views the current price as demanding, based on a fair value anchor of US$20.00 that already factors in profitability, buybacks and some benefit from AI, while still highlighting competition and growth risk.</li> </ul> <p>These two narratives bracket the recent share price by using different assumptions about revenue trends, margins and how much credit Dropbox earns for its AI initiatives and capital returns. The useful next step is to decide which set of assumptions feels closer to how you see the business, or to shape your own view somewhere between the two.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

Recent moves may reflect shifting views on Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' growth potential in rare disease treatments and how investors balance that against risks and valuation.</p> <p>If Rhythm Pharmaceuticals has caught your eye, it could be a good moment to see what else is setting the pace in the sector via our list of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 healthcare AI stocks</a>.</p> <p>With Rhythm trading at US$99.15, an intrinsic value estimate at a discount, and a sizeable gap to the US$141.80 analyst target, you have to ask: is this a genuine mispricing or is future growth already fully reflected?</p> <h2>Most Popular Narrative: 24.6% Undervalued</h2> <p>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals' most followed valuation narrative pegs fair value at $131.50, comfortably above the recent $99.15 close. This raises clear questions about what is priced in around rare disease obesity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals enters late February 2026 as the leader in \"rare disease obesity,\" a niche that has remained remarkably insulated from the broader GLP-1 price wars. The company’s core asset, Setmelanotide, has seen rapid uptake in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and POMC deficiency, where traditional weight-loss drugs often fail.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/2s99oift-rare-obesity-leadership-can-setmelanotide-scale-beyond-the-clinic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>It is worth examining how a single rare disease franchise supports that higher fair value.
