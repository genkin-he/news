We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Afrimat's Profit Performance</h2><p> We'd posit that Afrimat's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item.      Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Afrimat is showing <strong>2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 1 of those is significant...   </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Afrimat's profit.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   If Neobo Fastigheter doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.   </p><p> <strong>Note:</strong> we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-neobo/neobo-fastigheter-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Neobo Fastigheter</a>. </p> <h2>Our Take On Neobo Fastigheter's Profit Performance</h2><p> Because unusual items detracted from Neobo Fastigheter's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter.      Because of this, we think Neobo Fastigheter's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     And it's also positive that the company showed enough improvement to book a profit this year, after losing money last year.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

One common approach is to try and find a company with <em>returns</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Although, when we looked at <strong>Wienerberger</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIE:WIE</a>), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

To calculate this metric for Wienerberger, this is the formula: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.073 = €346m ÷ (€6.3b - €1.6b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Wienerberger has an ROCE of 7.3%.</strong> On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 7.2%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Wienerberger </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/416194-roce-1-dark-2/1761827143455\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">WBAG:WIE Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Above you can see how the current ROCE for Wienerberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past.

The company has employed 36% more capital in the last  five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 7.3%.   Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.   </p><h2> Our Take On Wienerberger's ROCE </h2><p> In conclusion, Wienerberger has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased.       And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 29% to shareholders over the last  five years.  Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.    </p><p> If you'd like to know about the risks facing Wienerberger, we've discovered <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/at/materials/vie-wie/wienerberger-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign</strong></a> that you should be aware of.   </p><p> While Wienerberger may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Expro Group Holdings to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Expro Group Holdings' Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Expro Group Holdings' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Expro Group Holdings' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!     Furthermore, it has done a great job growing EPS over the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    In terms of investment risks, <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-xpro/expro-group-holdings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>we've identified 1 warning sign </strong>with Expro Group Holdings</a>, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Expro Group Holdings' profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly’s elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project. Unless rapid progress and commercialisation materialise, such a premium can be hard to sustain.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, negative earnings and reliance on optimistic asset valuations mean that any operational setbacks could quickly pressure FireFly Metals’ premium valuation.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-ffm/firefly-metals-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this FireFly Metals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Deep Discount on SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-book ratio suggests FireFly Metals is expensive compared to its industry, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

Its latest share price is up 85% year-to-date, and its three-year total shareholder return has soared past 360%.

This sets the stage for a look at the factors fueling that call.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Significant expansion of farm and production network, including acceleration of CapEx to build out capacity (two production lines at the Seymour, Indiana facility and additional cold storage), positions Vital Farms to fully capitalize on unmet/pent-up demand.

The company’s net profit margin has edged down to 3.8% from last year’s 3.9%, and over the past five years, earnings have declined at an annual rate of 8.2%, with negative earnings growth most recently reported. Investors are weighing the company’s good relative value, highlighted by its Price-to-Earnings ratio of 10.8x against peers and the broader industry, against continued revenue and profit underperformance.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for KomeriLtd.</a> <p>Next up, we will see how these headline numbers stack up against the narratives shaping investor sentiment.

This demonstrates resilience as the broader specialty retail sector faces ongoing cost headwinds.</li> <li>Investor commentary highlights Komeri’s reliable operations and steady cash flows even as industry competition intensifies.\n    <ul> <li>The steady margin performance positions Komeri as a lower-risk, defensive choice. This is especially valued when sector peers have reported steeper margin compression amid inflation.</li> <li>While margin stability is seen as a strength, the modest 0.1 percentage point decline indicates that securing future profitability will depend on ongoing operational improvements, not just defensive positioning.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Discount Signals Underlying Value Debate</h2> <ul> <li>Shares trade at ¥3,200, a 59% premium to the DCF fair value estimate of ¥2,007.03. The company’s P/E of 10.8x is attractively below peers and industry averages.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis points out that while Komeri looks undervalued on earnings compared to competitors, the significant DCF premium raises debate over whether the share price already reflects all its defensive advantages.\n    <ul> <li>This valuation tension spotlights Komeri’s appeal as a “good value” pick for relative P/E shoppers, but leaves room for debate on whether the broader market is overlooking risks tied to lagging growth rates and past earnings declines.</li> <li>Investors weighing value versus growth must reconcile the company’s below-peer P/E and defensive cash generation with the gap to intrinsic value implied by discounted cash flows.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Five-Year Earnings Slide Raises Bar for Improvement</h2> <ul> <li>Earnings have declined by an annual rate of 8.2% over the last five years, and the latest period also saw negative growth. This extends a multi-year pattern of underperformance compared to market averages.</li> <li>Despite commendable cost management, broader market observers caution that continued declines amplify the importance of management executing on digital upgrades and margin stabilization.\n    <ul> <li>Some see Komeri’s steady dividend and focus on operational improvements as important, but argue that these have yet to reverse the entrenched earnings downtrend that positions the company as a “reliable but slow” performer compared to more dynamic peers.</li> <li>With revenue and earnings growth forecasts still trailing the Japanese market, calls for bold execution are growing louder among investors who want evidence that management can deliver a meaningful turnaround.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on KomeriLtd's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/retail/tse-8218/komeriltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Fresnillo (LON:FRES) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 61% over the last three months.   We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fresnillo's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital.

That means that for every £1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated £0.14 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Fresnillo </a></span></p> <h2> What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? </h2><p> We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. </p><h2> Fresnillo's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE  </h2><p> To start with, Fresnillo's ROE looks acceptable.   Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%.   However, while Fresnillo has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 10.0% .  We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth.  Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.    </p><p> So, as a next step, we compared Fresnillo's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 8.2% over the last few years.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/44543451-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761827352628\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LSE:FRES Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Fresnillo is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Fresnillo Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 49% (where it is retaining 51% of its profits), Fresnillo has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above.  It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.   </p> <p> Additionally, Fresnillo has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 48%.   Still, forecasts suggest that Fresnillo's future ROE will rise to 29% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> In total, it does look like Fresnillo has some positive aspects to its business.      Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

The recent launches of compact, tech-forward G-SHOCK models reinforce Casio’s strength in product innovation, though they do not appear to materially shift the most important near-term catalyst, successful scaling of premium SKU sales outside China, nor do they fully resolve the key risk of ongoing declines in core revenue and margin pressure.\n</p> <p> Among the latest product announcements, the GST-B1000D’s blend of classic design cues and cutting-edge Bluetooth-enabled features best illustrates efforts to move upmarket and respond to global consumer demand for both functionality and craftsmanship.
