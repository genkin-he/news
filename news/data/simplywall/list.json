This potentially suggests undervaluation against current sector norms and the company's recent closing price of Â¥1,515.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio compares the companyâ€™s market price to its earnings per share. For utilities like Kyushu Electric, this multiple is commonly used to assess if investors are paying a reasonable price for current profits given the industryâ€™s stable but often low-growth characteristics.</p> <p>The companyâ€™s P/E of 5.4x is less than half the Japanese marketâ€™s average of 14.4x and significantly below the Asian electric utilities industry average of 17.1x. This indicates that the market may be underpricing its earnings potential. However, when compared to direct peers, Kyushu Electric appears somewhat more expensive than the peer average of 4.3x. Regression analysis also estimates a fair P/E ratio for Kyushu Electric at 8.5x, emphasizing that current market pricing remains conservative relative to what could be justified by fundamentals.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9508/kyushu-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kyushu Electric Power Company</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 5.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain.

The recent Sanofi transfer brings some immediate revenue opportunity through milestone payments, but it does not remove the near-term dependency on external partners delivering regulatory and commercial successes. Short-term momentum could hinge on the pace and consistency of these milestone flows, while the main risk remains a slowdown or deferral of such payments that would challenge Novavaxâ€™s cash flow and earnings projections.\n</p> <p> One recent development relevant to this pivot is the expanded collaboration with Sanofi to use Matrix-M in their pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, underscoring Novavaxâ€™s intent to monetize its platform beyond COVID-19. These partnership agreements could become key revenue levers, but dependable cash generation still relies heavily on timely regulatory and commercial achievements by both Novavax and its larger partners.\n</p> <p> However, in contrast to the promise of partnership-driven revenue, investors should also remain mindful that if partner milestones underperform or arrive late, the impact on liquidity and growth could be...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-nvax/novavax/peugv6f6-confidence-in-licensing-shift-and-partnerships-will-drive-opportunities-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Novavax (it's free!)</a></p><p>Novavax's outlook suggests revenues of $348.5 million and earnings of $55.9 million by 2028.

Earlier in the year, they fetched AU$1.36 per share in a -AU$2.7m sale.     That means that even when the share price was below the current price of AU$1.95, an insider wanted to cash in some shares.  We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Alan Steele's holding.    </p> <p> Alan Steele divested 2.49m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of AU$1.44.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership.   Mayfield Group Holdings insiders own 64% of the company, currently worth about AU$122m based on the recent share price.  Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> An insider hasn't  bought Mayfield Group Holdings stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.     Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying.    On the plus side, Mayfield Group Holdings makes money, and is growing profits.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Watts Water Technologies (WTS) shares have pulled back about 2% over the past month, even as the companyâ€™s returns this year remain strong. Investors may be weighing recent performance alongside steady growth in annual revenue and net income.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nyse-wts/watts-water-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Watts Water Technologies.</a></p> <p>Watts Water Technologies has climbed steadily in 2024, with a 36% year-to-date share price return and a robust 44% total shareholder return over the past year. This highlights real long-term momentum. While shares have eased slightly in recent weeks, investors seem to be recalibrating after substantial multi-year gains and strong financial growth.</p> <p>If youâ€™re curious where similar momentum might be building, now is the perfect moment to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Watts shares hovering near their recent highs and growth metrics remaining healthy, the key question now is whether the current price reflects all that future momentum or if investors still have a buying opportunity.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued</h2> <p>Watts Water Technologiesâ€™ most followed narrative points to a fair value of $277.80, almost identical to the recent closing price of $273.07, highlighting a market consensus that the stock is currently priced about right. This sets the stage for a closer look at whatâ€™s driving analyst conviction about Wattsâ€™ future earnings and market opportunity.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The accelerating rollout and success of Nexa, Watts' intelligent water management platform, positions the company to capture the growing demand for advanced, data-driven water conservation, efficiency, and regulatory compliance solutions. This is expected to drive higher-margin, recurring revenue and support long-term earnings and margin expansion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/o1j3uth9-water-infrastructure-upgrades-will-fuel-demand-in-urban-markets-l9xl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what assumptions drive this razor-thin fair value margin?

Watts trades at 29.2x earnings, noticeably higher than both the industry average of 24.6x and the peer average of 28.7x. The fair ratio, which could be the level the market moves toward, is just 21.1x. This premium signals the market expects outsized growth or rewards quality.

However, looking further back, average annual earnings growth reached 16.8% over the past five years, and Equinor has become consistently profitable during that time.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/energy/ob-eqnr/equinor-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Equinor.</a> <p>Up next, we will put these results side-by-side with the most widely followed narratives to see where the data confirms the market consensus and where it challenges those views.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Equinor</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/no/energy/ob-eqnr/equinor-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"OB:EQNR Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cf18493a-f89c-4ecb-9568-84ca2caa5110/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>OB:EQNR Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>PE Ratio Stands Out Versus Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Equinorâ€™s current Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio of 10.5x is noticeably lower than both the European Oil and Gas industry average of 14.3x and the peer groupâ€™s average of 14.5x.</li> <li>According to analysts' consensus view, this PE gap signals the market is factoring in either slower earnings growth or heightened risks.

If realized, this would mark a dramatic recovery from current lows.</li> <li> According to analysts' consensus view, several trends drive this optimism: \n    <ul> <li>Digital sales are increasing, with web sales up 8.4% in Q2, alongside new investments in omnichannel and digital marketing efficiency.</li> <li>Supply chain shifts to reduce China exposure and grow partnerships in Vietnam are meant to boost gross margins and stabilize profit, highlighting a proactive approach to future disruptions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Despite Growth Forecasts</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of $21.65, Haverty trades well below both its DCF fair value of $60.94 and the consensus analyst target of $29.00. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2x is a deep discount to peer averages at 34.9x.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus narrative emphasizes this rare combination:\n    <ul> <li>Storm clouds from weak housing and macro headwinds have not derailed a forecast of 7.2% annual revenue growth or the expectation for earnings to climb from $19.6 million to $107.4 million by 2028, showing potential for long-term upside.</li> <li>Sustained focus on brand loyalty and deeper market penetration in the southern U.S. is expected to drive long-term demand, while a discount to DCF fair value and peer multiples provides an added margin of safety for new investors entering at todayâ€™s price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Even analysts who take a wait-and-see approach acknowledge the substantial gap between the current price and projected value, suggesting plenty of room for sentiment to shift if the fundamentals play out as forecast. <strong>ðŸ“ˆ Read the full Haverty Furniture Companies Consensus Narrative.</strong></p> <h2>Dividend and Cost Pressures Remain Manageable</h2> <ul> <li>Despite some flagged risks around dividend sustainability and higher SG&amp;A costs, no major risks were highlighted, and there is no evidence of significant recent insider selling.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus view highlights that persistent cost pressures, such as rising advertising and occupancy costs, are in focus. However, operational improvements via supply chain diversification and expanding store footprint are expected to offset much of this, with only minor risk to the companyâ€™s ability to deliver forecasted earnings growth.\n    <ul> <li>The company's plan to grow physical presence in high-potential southern U.S. markets aims to leverage fixed costs and capture market share, potentially enhancing long-term earnings durability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ns9p7qtj-us-housing-trends-will-fuel-omnichannel-and-supply-chain-shifts-wl7v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Haverty Furniture Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Looking at the data from a fresh angle?
