These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.</a></p><p> To get a sense of who is truly in control of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PRUDENT</a>), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business.  And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 58% ownership.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> As market cap fell to ₹106b last week, insiders would have faced the highest losses than any other shareholder groups of the company.    </p><p> In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudent Advisory Services. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Prudent Advisory Services </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761972942585\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Ownership Breakdown November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudent Advisory Services?</h2><p> Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. </p> <p> Prudent Advisory Services already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudent Advisory Services' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/35187355-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761972943724\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PRUDENT Earnings and Revenue Growth November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Prudent Advisory Services is not owned by hedge funds.      From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Sanjay Shah (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 55% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.      Additionally, the company's CEO Shirish Patel directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.   </p><p> While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.   There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Prudent Advisory Services</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. </p><p> Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. </p> <p> Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company.   Given it has a market cap of ₹106b, that means insiders have a whopping ₹61b worth of shares in their own names.  It is good to see this level of investment. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/diversified-financials/nse-prudent/prudent-advisory-services-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check here to see if those insiders have been selling any of their shares. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored.   While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. </p> <h2>Private Company Ownership</h2><p> Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 6.7%, of the company's shares.   It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.  </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. </p> <p> I always like to check for a <strong>history of revenue growth</strong>.

The latest set of results, showing a small net loss in the most recent quarter but a dramatic surge in net income over the nine months, doesn’t fundamentally change this long-term story. The regular and special dividends, combined with a debt-free balance sheet, still signal strong capital management. However, the pullback in share repurchases this quarter and the market’s recent price drop may point to some shifting priorities or softer near-term demand for data licensing. While the headline profit swing and continued capital return matter, they don’t seem material enough to offset ongoing risks like volatility in seismic data sales linked to energy sector uncertainty.\n<br/><br/> Conversely, short-term swings in licensing revenues can change the outlook quickly for shareholders.\n</p> Despite retreating, Pulse Seismic's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover how much</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-psd/pulse-seismic-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/32be1ff6-af93-4e90-ab28-50d059107da5/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:PSD Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirteen individual fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from C$1.89 to a very large C$509,435.53 per share.

This highlights a clear valuation discount for investors at the current share price of $36.24.</li> <li>The current comparison to sector norms supports the idea that, even with short-term profit boosts, the market awaits more consistent evidence of durable earnings before awarding a valuation closer to industry multiples.\n    <ul> <li>While discounted pricing can appear attractive, it underscores how investors tend to approach such valuations carefully when underlying profit drivers rely on non-recurring events.</li> <li>This context positions the present multiple as a potential opportunity or simply a reflection of ongoing skepticism related to earnings quality.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

This makes the recent margin uptick tricky for bullish investors to celebrate without more evidence.</li> <li>Bulls often focus on the return to profit and margin expansion, but fundamentals suggest that one-off charges remain just as important for a true earnings reset.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Price-to-Sales Lags Sector, but Premium to DCF Fair Value Raises Eyebrows</h2> <ul> <li>Taiho Kogyo trades at 0.2x price-to-sales, lower than the peer average of 0.5x and the broad industry level of 0.4x. This suggests a valuation discount on revenues despite a share price of ¥685 that stands well above the DCF fair value of ¥272.10.</li> <li>Optimists argue the sector-relative discount makes the stock attractive, but\n    <ul> <li>the sizable premium to its own DCF value shows that market sentiment is pricing in a brighter future than fundamentals alone may justify, especially given that past five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3% per year.</li> <li>Peer comparisons favor Taiho Kogyo on a price-to-sales basis. However, the fair value gap reminds value-driven investors to stay alert for a potential reset if future results do not deliver.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend Durability in Question as Non-Recurring Losses Continue</h2> <ul> <li>The company’s recent five-year annual earnings growth averaged -32.3%. Ongoing concerns about dividend sustainability are heightened by non-recurring losses like the recent ¥1.1 billion charge.</li> <li>Supporters point to profit or revenue growth as a reason for optimism, but \n    <ul> <li>reliable dividend payments will likely require not just stable, but sustainably increasing, core profits. This can be challenging when one-off costs remain a drag.</li> <li>Positive sector comparisons may signal some resilience, but fundamental risks around earnings quality and dividend coverage persist until the noise from non-recurring items settles down.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Measured optimism about Taiho Kogyo’s foundation persists, but concrete progress on recurring profitability will matter most for investors watching future payout potential. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-6470/taiho-kogyo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Taiho Kogyo.</a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The recent announcement of stronger-than-expected interim results, a raised full-year earnings forecast, and a substantial 36% interim dividend increase signals that key short-term catalysts, like steady end-market demand and effective cost controls, have become more pronounced. These upgrades suggest that profitability momentum is stronger than earlier analysis indicated. Previous risks centered around external threats such as US tariffs and margin pressure from slow revenue growth now appear somewhat diminished, at least in the near term, as the latest results point to solid operational execution and less impact from geopolitical headwinds than first feared. However, valuation remains a concern, with the current share price trading above consensus fair value and a price-to-earnings ratio well above industry averages, which keeps expectations high.</p> But valuation risk could still catch some investors off guard, especially after recent share gains.\n\nSumitomo Electric Industries' shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 12%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/automobiles/tse-5802/sumitomo-electric-industries-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c5fdbcb3-b869-47ae-bfdc-127d4419245a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:5802 Community Fair Values as at Nov 2025</figcaption></figure> Among the Simply Wall St Community, two retail investors estimate fair values for Sumitomo Electric Industries between ¥2,499,690 and ¥4,808,560.

At a last close of $106.5, this premium valuation raises the question of whether it is reflective of genuine business momentum or a sign of over-optimism.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio tells investors how much they are paying today for each dollar of company earnings. For banks, a lower P/E can point to market concern over growth or credit quality, while a higher P/E may imply a strong earnings outlook or investor appetite for risk. In this case, Coastal Financial’s elevated P/E highlights market confidence in its future earnings growth but also sets a high bar for actual performance.</p> <p>Compared to its main benchmarks, Coastal Financial’s P/E is much higher than the US Banks industry average of 11.2x and the peer group average of 11.6x. The fair price-to-earnings ratio, estimated at 20.6x by regression analysis, suggests current levels are running high and could face downward adjustment if results disappoint or growth slows.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ccb/coastal-financial/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Coastal Financial</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 33.7x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, earnings momentum could stall if loan growth slows or if higher rates begin to pressure deposit costs and margins.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-ccb/coastal-financial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Coastal Financial narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: The SWS DCF Model</h2> <p>While the price-to-earnings ratio points to a premium valuation, the SWS DCF model offers a different perspective.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Despite an already strong run, <strong>SK hynix Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) shares have been powering on, with a gain of 55% in the last thirty days.    The last month tops off a massive increase of 207% in the last year.   </p><p> Although its price has surged higher, SK hynix may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 10.8x, since almost half of all companies in Korea have P/E ratios greater than 15x and even P/E's higher than 35x are not unusual.  However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.   </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> SK hynix certainly has been doing a good job lately as its earnings growth has been positive while most other companies have been seeing their earnings go backwards.   It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, possibly more than the market, which has repressed the P/E.  If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"pe-multiple-vs-industry\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-pe-multiple-vs-industry-1-dark-2/1761958408422\" width=\"1640\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Price to Earnings Ratio vs Industry November 1st 2025</figcaption></figure> Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company?

The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 283% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.   </p> <p> Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 8.7% per annum over the next three years.  Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 20% each year, which paints a poor picture. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that SK hynix's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies.  However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term.  There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.  </p> <h2> What We Can Learn From SK hynix's P/E? </h2><p> Despite SK hynix's shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of SK hynix's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.    </p><p> You always need to take note of risks, for example -<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>SK hynix has 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of SK hynix's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

The company’s price-to-earnings ratio sits at just 7.5x, notably lower than both the peer average of 39x and the industry average of 34.1x.

This approach\n    <ul> <li> drives recurring software revenues with more predictable streams, and\n      </li> <li> contributes to higher EBITDA margins and operational leverage as lower-margin legacy products are phased out.\n      </li> </ul> </li> <li> After these latest numbers, see if the consensus narrative is evolving and whether margin pressure or upside surprises could change the outlook. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full OneSpan Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> </li> </ul> <h2>Future Earnings Projected to Decline Sharply by 2028</h2> <ul> <li> Analyst estimates call for annual earnings to drop from $59.9 million now to $26.1 million by September 2028, as profit margins are forecast to shrink to 9.3% and annual revenue growth slows to 5.3%.\n  </li> <li> The consensus narrative notes these forecasts highlight both execution risks and ongoing revenue pressure. It emphasizes that\n    <ul> <li> the shift away from hardware and legacy contracts is creating persistent topline headwinds, and\n      </li> <li> reliance on acquisitions plus intense competition may limit organic innovation, challenging the durability of recent gains.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>PE Ratio and DCF Valuation Suggest Potential Upside</h2> <ul> <li> At a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5x and a share price of $11.4, OneSpan trades far below its DCF fair value of $23.66 and the US Software industry average P/E of 34.1x.\n  </li> <li> In the analysts' consensus view, this deep discount reflects skepticism about sustaining profitability. However, it leaves the door open for re-rating if execution improves or recurring revenues stabilize faster than expected, because\n    <ul> <li> the consensus price target of $18.50 implies roughly 62% upside from here, even as forecasts anticipate a shrinking bottom line, and\n      </li> <li> positive catalysts like cross-selling and new product innovation could drive a reassessment if current headwinds are overcome.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/6e43q3ny-digital-banking-trends-will-reshape-cybersecurity-amid-integration-risks-qhs4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OneSpan on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have your own interpretation of the latest figures?
