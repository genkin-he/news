While the recent milestone sparked optimism, the long-term total shareholder return of over 150% for three years highlights how growth catalysts are beginning to stack up for the company.

Over the last five years, the company has grown earnings at a 7.5% annual rate, and forward-looking estimates peg earnings expansion at 8.9% per year, which is slower than the broader US market's expected 15.6% annual pace. Revenue is projected to climb 4.3% annually, which also trails the national benchmark. Notably, the most recent year’s earnings growth of 0.6% came in below the company’s five-year average. While the ongoing record of profit growth stands out, investors face a premium-priced stock, as Sherwin-Williams trades at 33.1x earnings, well above both industry and peer averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-shw/sherwin-williams\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Sherwin-Williams.</a> <p>The next section puts these headline numbers under the microscope, comparing Sherwin-Williams’ results to the most widely held narratives in the market.

This valuation sits far above both the industry and peer group averages, signaling the market's strong expectations for future growth or strategic advantages.</p> <p>The price-to-sales ratio is a popular gauge for growth stocks, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s sales. In the capital goods sector, it can reflect anticipated expansion, disruptive potential, or market hype.

Based on regression estimates, a fair price-to-sales ratio for the company would be closer to 5x, which is significantly below the current market multiple.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's <em>amount</em> of capital employed.  Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine.    Having said that, from a first glance at <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BVMF:AMBP3</a>) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) </h2><p> Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.  Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.088 = R$1.3b ÷ (R$17b - R$2.7b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> Therefore, <strong>Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos has an ROCE of 8.8%.</strong> Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 12%.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/280812082-roce-1-dark-2/1761841524441\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">BOVESPA:AMBP3 Return on Capital Employed October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 14% over the last five years.    However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns.  If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line </h2><p> Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos.        But since the stock has dived 86% in the last  five years, there could be other drivers that are influencing the business' outlook.  Regardless, reinvestment can pay off in the long run, so we think astute investors may want to look further into this stock.     </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/br/commercial-services/bovespa-ambp3/ambipar-participacoes-e-empreendimentos-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> While Ambipar Participações e Empreendimentos may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The announcement that Equinor is joining Ørsted’s rights issue could be an inflection point for the company’s short-term catalysts, particularly around capital strength and future project partnerships. This fresh collaboration has the potential to accelerate project development and attract further industry confidence, partially addressing capital concerns that prompted Hornsea 3 and onshore asset sales. However, investors should note that positive sentiment from Equinor’s move may not fully offset persistent challenges such as relatively high debt, volatile cash flows, and slow revenue growth projections. The industry-wide push for shared expertise could help mitigate execution risk, but sustaining profitability in an expensive and competitive sector continues to be a central risk. </p> But given fluctuating project returns, the risk of mounting debt remains significant for Ørsted shareholders.\n\nØrsted's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 36%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/dk/utilities/cph-orsted/rsted-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/5033cd2f-f7d1-4a87-a70b-961f065af5e6/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>CPSE:ORSTED Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has generated 15 fair value estimates ranging from as little as DKK0.10 to DKK350 per share.

Its 38% year-to-date share price return speaks to revived confidence. Meanwhile, the 44% total shareholder return over the past year makes it a standout among peers, as investors factor in both capital gains and dividends.</p> <p>If the financial sector’s shift has you thinking bigger, consider broadening your scope and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a>.</p> <p>The big question for investors now is whether Bank of New York Mellon’s strong run leaves the stock undervalued, or if the current price already reflects all the expected growth ahead.

Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have grown at an annual rate of 8.1%, but the latest twelve months saw a slower 4.9% rise. With analysts forecasting earnings growth of 15.4% per year, comfortably ahead of both the Swiss market and industry peers, investors are now weighing the implications of robust growth expectations against a share price that trades well below fair value, even if valuation multiples remain at a premium to sector averages.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Amrize.</a> <p>Now, let's see how these results compare with the broader market narratives and community sentiment.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend. We've done an in-depth analysis on Amrize's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">growth</a> and its <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_dont_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ch/materials/vtx-amrz/amrize-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">valuation</a> to see if today's price is a bargain.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso.

The company currently trades at 22.4 times earnings, which is higher than the peer average of 14.5 times and the industry’s 13.2 times.

While the CFO transition introduces some near-term uncertainty, it’s unlikely to materially impact these fundamental drivers.\n</p> <p> Among recent announcements, the completion of the Simpele mill modernization stands out as most relevant.

The idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and determine what that is worth in today’s dollars.</p> <p>For Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, the DCF analysis uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Current free cash flow is negative, at $-54.2 million, reflecting ongoing heavy investments in growth. Analysts expect free cash flow to become positive over time, with projections reaching $108.3 million by 2035. Estimates are provided directly from analysts for the first five years, and then Simply Wall St extrapolates them for the next five years.</p> <p>Despite these optimistic projections, the DCF model estimates the fair value of Kratos’s shares at $8.83 each. Compared to the current share price, the model suggests that the stock is 933.0% overvalued.</p> <p>If you are searching for a bargain, this analysis indicates Kratos shares are priced far above what its future cash flows would justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may be overvalued by 933.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>KTOS Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Price vs Sales</h3> <p>The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio is often favored for valuing companies like Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, particularly when profits are inconsistent or still developing. This metric compares a company’s market value to its sales, offering a clear picture for businesses that are growing quickly or reinvesting heavily for future gains.</p> <p>The \"right\" P/S ratio for a stock is influenced by factors such as growth expectations and business risks. High-growth companies with perceived safer prospects can command higher multiples. Those facing slowdowns or higher uncertainty typically trade at lower P/S ratios.</p> <p>Currently, Kratos trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7x. This is substantially higher than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 3.10x and the peer average of 4.51x. However, raw comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company-specific factors.</p> <p>This is where Simply Wall St’s proprietary “Fair Ratio” comes in. It combines elements like earnings growth estimates, profit margins, market cap, company-specific risks, and industry dynamics to determine what a rational multiple should be for Kratos specifically. For Kratos, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 2.62x, which is considerably below the current 12.7x multiple.</p> <p>That gap suggests Kratos shares are trading at a rich premium to what the underlying business characteristics would justify, even after adjusting for its growth outlook and market position.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS PS Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1387 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple and actionable way to express your personal perspective on a company by linking its story and future outlook to an explicit financial forecast and an estimated fair value.</p> <p>Rather than relying on just a single model or analyst opinion, Narratives help you clarify what you believe about the business, from how fast revenue will grow, to what margins it could achieve, and what risks matter most. You can then calculate what that means for fair value. This approach bridges the gap between stories and numbers, making it easier to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold based on the difference between your Fair Value and today’s price.</p> <p>Narratives are available right now on Simply Wall St’s Community page, making it accessible for anyone to build and share their own investment case, just like millions of investors already do. Best of all, they update dynamically as new earnings announcements, news, or market moves come in, so your scenario always reflects the latest information.</p> <p>For example, different investors looking at Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions may have sharply different Narratives. One might see a fair value as high as $93 per share due to ongoing contract wins and rapid defense expansion, while another could see it as low as $60 if they are concerned about cash flow risk and delayed contract execution.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/capital-goods/nasdaq-ktos/kratos-defense-security-solutions/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/f17225db-6dc6-447e-9be1-f0314c8b4aa3/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:KTOS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Netskope (NTSK) stock has quietly moved higher over the past week, gaining 7% even as the rest of the market grappled with mixed signals.

While the year-to-date share price return is a positive 4%, this latest rally suggests that investor optimism could be building as sentiment shifts around cybersecurity growth stories like Netskope.</p> <p>If today’s momentum has you curious about what else could be on the move, it’s the perfect chance to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_tech_and_ai_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/215171/high-growth-tech-and-ai-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With a share price rally underway and double-digit annual revenue growth, the main question becomes whether Netskope’s current valuation reflects untapped potential or if the market has already priced in the company’s future gains.

At a last close of $23.41, this premium valuation raises the question of whether investors are overestimating Netskope's potential compared to rivals.</p> <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current sales. It is often used for high-growth tech companies that may not yet be profitable. For expanding firms like Netskope, a higher multiple can reflect future growth expectations or strong market positioning. However, it may also indicate frothy sentiment if financial fundamentals lag behind those hopes.</p> <p>Specifically, Netskope's 14.5x P/S is almost double the peer group average of 7.5x and almost triple the US Software industry average of 5.4x. This sharp divergence suggests the market is either expecting superior growth or is currently overvaluing the company relative to peers, especially given that Netskope is not yet profitable.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 14.5x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, ongoing lack of profitability and a high valuation compared to peers could spark a turnaround if revenue growth slows or investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Netskope narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model Puts Valuation Into Question</h2> <p>Taking a different perspective with our SWS DCF model, Netskope appears even more stretched on valuation.
