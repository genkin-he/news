            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Investors in <strong>Jindal Steel Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:JINDALSTEL</a>) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.1% to close at ₹1,070 following the release of its second-quarter results.       It was a workmanlike result, with revenues of ₹117b coming in 4.9% ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share of ₹27.83, in line with analyst appraisals.     The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of.  So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If met, it would imply a notable 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 110% to ₹56.56.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ₹566.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹61.65 in 2026.        So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Jindal Steel </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target held steady at ₹1,093, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future.        Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation.  There are some variant perceptions on Jindal Steel, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at ₹1,400 and the most bearish at ₹600 per share.   Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.    </p> <p> One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/materials/metals-mining\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> are performing.     It's clear from the latest estimates that Jindal Steel's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 30% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.6% p.a. over the past five years.    Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 11% annually.  Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Jindal Steel is expected to grow much faster than its industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results.        Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   We have estimates - from multiple Jindal Steel analysts - going out to 2028, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/materials/nse-jindalstel/jindal-steel-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a> </p><p> You should always think about risks though.

In the automotive sector, where margins can be thin and growth cyclical, this multiple is a common benchmark for valuation. A lower P/E can indicate undervaluation or expectations of slower growth ahead.</p> <p>At 10.9x, Suzuki Motor stands out as attractively priced, especially when compared to the Japanese market average of 14.3x and the Asian auto industry’s 21.4x. The company also looks inexpensive next to its peer group’s average of 14.9x and even the fair price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1x calculated by regression analysis.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.'  So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is.  As with many other companies <strong>PDS Limited</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:PDSL</a>) makes use of debt.  But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. </p> <h2> What Is PDS's Net Debt? </h2><p> The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2025 PDS had debt of ₹11.0b, up from ₹9.76b in one year.    However, because it has a cash reserve of ₹10.5b, its net debt is less, at about ₹530.0m.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"debt-equity-history-analysis\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1052\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/225670672-debt-equity-history-analysis-1-dark-2/1761871252616\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:PDSL Debt to Equity History October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> How Strong Is PDS' Balance Sheet? </h2><p> According to the last reported balance sheet, PDS had liabilities of ₹29.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of ₹2.44b due beyond 12 months.   On the other hand, it had cash of ₹10.5b and ₹14.2b worth of receivables due within a year.   So it has liabilities totalling ₹6.87b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.  </p><p> Of course, PDS has a  market capitalization of ₹52.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable.  But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.    Carrying virtually no net debt, PDS has a very light debt load indeed.  </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for PDS </a></span></p> <p> We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover).  This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. </p> <p> PDS has a very low debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.15 so it is strange to see weak interest coverage, with last year's EBIT being only 2.4 times the interest expense.  So while we're not necessarily alarmed we think that its debt is far from trivial.        Unfortunately, PDS's EBIT flopped 13% over the last four quarters.  If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine PDS's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.  So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-pdsl/pds-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.  </p><p> But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash.   So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow.    During the last three years, PDS produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   </p> <h2>Our View</h2><p> When it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for PDS was the fact that it seems able handle its debt, based on its EBITDA, confidently.  However, our other observations weren't so heartening.   In particular, interest cover gives us cold feet.       When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about PDS's use of debt.  While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase.    There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet.  But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Even healthy companies may need to adjust dividends if cash flows tighten.</li> <li>The watchpoint is whether future profits can maintain or increase current payout levels while still supporting reinvestment and growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Fair Value Suggests Premium Pricing</h2> <ul> <li>The latest share price of 1,234.00 trades at a significant premium to the DCF fair value estimate of 687.51, highlighting a substantial gap between market confidence and modeled intrinsic worth.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis calls attention to this disconnect, with the company’s relatively low earnings multiple contrasting sharply with its share price premium, raising questions as to whether optimism is outpacing fundamentals.\n    <ul> <li>The fair value gap may signal either a strong belief that profit quality will endure or that the market is betting on better-than-modeled growth ahead.</li> <li>This divide puts future quarters under a microscope to see if actual results close that valuation gap, or if risk perceptions eventually catch up with the stock’s pricing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.06.  Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.   </p> <p> Stuart Richardson bought a total of 5.15m shares over the year at an average price of AU$0.023.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Canadian Phosphate insiders own 27% of the company, worth about AU$4.9m.  This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Canadian Phosphate Tell Us? </h2><p> Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months.  The net investment is not enough to encourage us much.     However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening.   Insiders own shares in Canadian Phosphate and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future.

The latest series of announcements, including long-term nuclear collaborations and the lease of flexible gas turbines, significantly bolster the odds that Fermi can move from concept to initial power generation as early as 2026. These partnerships with global engineering leaders and supportive local government agreements address some of the biggest short-term execution risks by securing technology, fuel, water, and tax incentives, which were major question marks before. The near-term catalyst remains delivery of the first 500 MW of generation capacity, while successful project execution and revenue generation are now even more critical milestones. However, given Fermi’s lack of revenue, unproven business model, and very new management team, material risks still exist despite recent optimism and price gains driven largely by sentiment rather than underlying results.\nBut investors should remember: management experience remains a key issue for a business at this scale.\n</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on Fermi</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cf0e1010-6f0a-428b-ae71-d75e592ca2cd/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$3.50 to US$35 per share.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Crinetics Pharmaceuticals (CRNX) shares have shown impressive movement over the past three months, rising 50 percent. Investors are watching closely as the company’s performance stands out in the biotechnology sector this quarter.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Crinetics Pharmaceuticals.</a></p> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals has staged a remarkable turnaround after a tough start to the year. Over the last 90 days, the company has delivered a 50 percent share price gain, which stands in stark contrast to its 1-year total shareholder return of -23 percent. This momentum suggests renewed optimism around the company’s prospects, especially following some positive signals in the sector, and indicates that investor sentiment may be shifting in favor of future growth.</p> <p>Looking to discover more in the healthcare space? Now’s a great time to check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_healthcare_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With such a rapid rebound, the big question facing investors is whether Crinetics Pharmaceuticals still has room to run or if the market has already anticipated this momentum, making further gains harder to come by.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Book of 3.4x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Crinetics Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of 3.4x, which falls below its peer average of 7x. This suggests the stock appears cheap relative to similar companies in the pharmaceuticals and biotech sector, based on this specific valuation metric.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio is a commonly used measure for companies, especially in sectors where profits may not yet be material, like biotech. It compares a company's market value to its book value, offering a snapshot of how the market is assessing future growth potential or asset strength relative to peers.</p> <p>At 3.4x, Crinetics looks undervalued when contrasted with its peer group but more expensive than the broader US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 2.3x. This disparity may indicate that investors expect strong future growth from Crinetics, which could justify the premium to the wider industry, yet the valuation still lags behind top peers. However, keep in mind that Crinetics is currently unprofitable, and valuation based on book value rather than earnings is typical in early-stage biotech. If the market shifts its fair ratio expectations, the multiple could adjust accordingly.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Book of 3.4x (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, investors must consider that unprofitability and sharp recent gains could bring volatility or swift sentiment reversals if expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crnx/crinetics-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Crinetics Pharmaceuticals narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Perspective</h2> <p>Beyond simple book value comparisons, our DCF model values Crinetics Pharmaceuticals at $112.31 per share, well above its recent price of $42.90. This points to a much deeper undervaluation than what the price-to-book ratio suggests, but it also relies heavily on long-term growth projections that could shift rapidly.

This potentially reverses the long decline but requires substantial improvement from current weak levels.\n  </li> <li> In line with the analysts' consensus view, this projected margin recovery is backed by the company’s shift toward digital platforms, expanding circular economy services, and recurring, long-term contracts.\n    <ul> <li> Full implementation of new ERP systems and digital tools is anticipated to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and support sustained margin expansion if execution stays on track.\n      </li> <li> The growth in sustainability-driven and data-led business lines is expected to increase recurring revenues and stabilize cash flow, both crucial for achieving higher profitability.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation: 136.7x P/E Versus DCF Fair Value of €30.76</h2> <ul> <li> Lassila &amp; Tikanoja shares currently trade at a 136.7x price-to-earnings ratio, far above both the European industry average (14.4x) and its peer group (23.6x). The DCF fair value is estimated at €30.76, roughly triple the latest share price of €10.02.\n  </li> <li> Analysts’ consensus narrative sees valuation tension. Although the stock is well below DCF fair value, analysts’ price target is just €10.50, only 4.8% above today’s price, reflecting skepticism around the pace of margin recovery and the risks to earnings quality.\n    <ul> <li> The consensus target implies analysts do not expect the stock to close the gap to DCF fair value soon, even if earnings growth outpaces the sector.\n      </li> <li> For value-focused investors, the key debate is whether operational execution and margin expansion can deliver enough upside to justify the premium multiple.\n      </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/lmh3njcz-digitalization-and-regulatory-demand-will-drive-circular-economy-success-gz6e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Lassila &amp; Tikanoja Oyj on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have another take on what the results mean?

This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. </p><p> Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive.  While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow.  To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive (India) has an accrual ratio of -0.16 for the year to September 2025.   That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit.    In fact, it had free cash flow of ₹14b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of ₹13.3b.    Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.  </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Profit Performance</h2><p> Happily for shareholders, Colgate-Palmolive (India) produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers.      Because of this, we think Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem!     And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.    Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive (India)</strong></a> you should be aware of.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stove Kraft's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested.

So, this means that for every ₹1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of ₹0.09. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Stove Kraft </a></span></p> <h2> What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth? </h2><p> So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability.  Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of Stove Kraft's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE </h2><p> It is hard to argue that Stove Kraft's ROE is much good in and of itself.   An industry comparison shows that the company's ROE is not much different from the industry average of 8.9% either.   Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 10% seen by Stove Kraft over the last five years is not surprising.    </p><p> However, when we compared Stove Kraft's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 16% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9674015-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761871371113\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:STOVEKRAFT Past Earnings Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Stove Kraft is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Stove Kraft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> When we piece together Stove Kraft's low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (where it is retaining 75% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth.  This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Only recently, Stove Kraft stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we have mixed feelings about Stove Kraft.      While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

With 38% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company.   That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). </p><p> Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to ₩1.9t last week.  Still, the 45% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses.  They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.    </p><p> Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Korean Reinsurance. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Korean Reinsurance </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ownership-breakdown\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-ownership-breakdown-1-dark-2/1761871432817\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Ownership Breakdown October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <h2>What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Korean Reinsurance?</h2><p> Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> Korean Reinsurance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Korean Reinsurance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761871433884\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Korean Reinsurance is not owned by hedge funds.      Our data shows that In-Soon Jang is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding.       Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.      Additionally, the company's CEO Jong-Gyu Won directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.   </p> <p> On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.  </p> <p> While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Korean Reinsurance</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Korean Reinsurance Company.   It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful ₩446b stake in this ₩1.9t business.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Korean Reinsurance.   This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Korean Reinsurance better, we need to consider many other factors. </p> <p> <strong>I like to dive deeper</strong> into how a company has performed in the past. You can find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">historic revenue and earnings in this <strong>detailed graph</strong></a>. </p> <p> But ultimately <strong> it is the future</strong>, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.
