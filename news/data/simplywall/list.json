While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    For instance, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs for John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen</strong> (2 shouldn't be ignored)</a> you should be familiar with.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's profit.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 33% over that time.   </p><p> Although its price has surged higher, Lachish Industries may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 11.8x, since almost half of all companies in Israel have P/E ratios greater than 17x and even P/E's higher than 29x are not unusual.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Lachish Industries currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching this positive performance.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.

We can't deny that higher profits generally leave us optimistic, but we'd prefer it if the profit were to be sustainable.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And that's as you'd expect, given these boosts are described as 'unusual'.   Assuming those unusual items don't show up again in the current year, we'd thus expect profit to be weaker next year (in the absence of business growth, that is).   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Afrimat's Profit Performance</h2><p> We'd posit that Afrimat's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item.      Because of this, we think that it may be that Afrimat's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    In further bad news, its earnings per share decreased in the last year.     The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    If you'd like to know more about Afrimat as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    Be aware that <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/za/materials/jse-aft/afrimat-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Afrimat is showing <strong>2 warning signs in our investment analysis</strong></a> and 1 of those is significant...   </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Afrimat's profit.

BioInvent International AB (publ), a clinical-stage company, discovers and develops immuno-modulatory antibodies for the treatment of cancer in Sweden, Europe, the United States, and internationally.    The kr2.0b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of kr429m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of kr292m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven.    Many investors are wondering about the rate at which BioInvent International will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?”  In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p><p> According to the 2 industry analysts covering BioInvent International, the consensus is that breakeven is near.   They expect the company to post a final loss in 2025, before turning a profit of kr198m in 2026.   The company is therefore projected to breakeven  just over a year from now.    How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2026? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 51% year-on-year, on average,    which is rather optimistic!  If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-binv/bioinvent-international-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/139682-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798510469\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:BINV Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of BioInvent International's upcoming projects,  though,  take into account  that by and large   biotechs, depending on the stage of product development, have irregular periods of cash flow.

BioInvent International currently has no debt on its balance sheet,  which is quite unusual for a cash-burning  biotech,   which usually has a high level of debt relative to its equity.  This means that the company has been operating purely on its equity investment and has no debt burden.

In fact, HAKI Safety increased the number of shares on issue by 9.1% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares.  Therefore, each share now receives a smaller portion of profit.  To talk about net income, without noticing earnings per share, is to be distracted by the big numbers while ignoring the smaller numbers that talk to <em>per share</em> value.  Check out HAKI Safety's historical EPS growth by <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clicking on this link</a>. </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> How Is Dilution Impacting HAKI Safety's Earnings Per Share (EPS)? </h2><p> Unfortunately, HAKI Safety's profit is down 57% per year over three years.    The good news is that profit was up 2.6% in the last twelve months.   On the other hand, earnings <em>per share</em> are pretty much flat, over the last twelve months.      So you can see that the dilution has had a bit of an impact on shareholders.   </p><p> In the long term, earnings <em>per share</em> growth should beget share price growth.  So it will certainly be a positive for shareholders if HAKI Safety can grow EPS persistently.   However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit.  For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company's share price might grow. </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On HAKI Safety's Profit Performance</h2><p> Each HAKI Safety share now gets a meaningfully smaller slice of its overall profit, due to dilution of existing shareholders.      Because of this, we think that it may be that HAKI Safety's statutory profits are better than its underlying earnings power.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     If you'd like to know more about HAKI Safety as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.    For example, HAKI Safety has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-haki-b/haki-safety-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs </strong>(and 1 which is concerning)</a> we think you should know about.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of HAKI Safety's profit.

Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 26% shows it's noticeably less attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that MVV Energie's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> It's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator. </p><p> As we suspected, our examination of MVV Energie revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its low P/E, given they look worse than current market expectations.  At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/utilities/etr-mvv1/mvv-energie-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for MVV Energie</strong></a> (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you need to be mindful of.  </p><p> If these <strong>risks are making you reconsider your opinion on MVV Energie</strong>, explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/206/big-green-snowflakes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of high quality stocks</a> to get an idea of what else is out there. </p></div>",

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Arjo to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Arjo's Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Arjo's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Arjo's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential!    On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Arjo has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/healthcare/sto-arjo-b/arjo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore these.  </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Arjo's profit.   But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.  Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Most would be very happy with that.    And in the last month, the share price has gained 16%.      </p><p> Since the stock has added ₹14b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.  </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p> <p> To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'  One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. </p> <p> During the five years of share price growth, Graphite India moved from a loss to profitability.   That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.  </p><p> You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-per-share-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1040\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/882655-earnings-per-share-growth-1-dark-2/1761798692283\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:GRAPHITE Earnings Per Share Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies.  But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.  Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Graphite India's <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">earnings, revenue and cash flow</a>. </p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>What About Dividends?</h2><p> As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR).  The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs.  So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return.  As it happens, Graphite India's TSR for the last 5 years was 292%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Graphite India shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year.   That's including the dividend.    However, that falls short of the 31% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.       While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Take risks, for example - Graphite India has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/capital-goods/nse-graphite/graphite-india-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.   </p><p> Of course, <strong>you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.</strong> So take a peek at this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/19524/growth-stocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</a> </p><p><em>Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Indian exchanges.</em></p></div>",

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual.   Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Swedencare to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-secare/swedencare-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Swedencare's Profit Performance</h2><p> Unusual items (expenses) detracted from Swedencare's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year.      Because of this, we think Swedencare's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better!      The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider.    Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future.  At Simply Wall St, we have analyst estimates which <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/pharmaceuticals-biotech/sto-secare/swedencare-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you can view by clicking here</a>. </p><p> Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Swedencare's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

Still, EPS has barely risen at all from three years ago in total, which is not ideal.  Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.   </p> <p> Comparing that to the market, which is predicted to deliver 28% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker based on recent medium-term annualised earnings results. </p><p> In light of this, it's understandable that Nelly Group's P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  It seems most investors are expecting to see the recent limited growth rates continue into the future and are only willing to pay a reduced amount for the stock.  </p> <h2> The Final Word </h2><p> Nelly Group's stock might have been given a solid boost, but its P/E certainly hasn't reached any great heights.      Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. </p><p> We've established that Nelly Group maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its recent three-year growth being lower than the wider market forecast, as expected.  Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.  If recent medium-term earnings trends continue, it's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.     </p><p> It is also worth noting that we have found <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/retail/sto-nelly/nelly-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for Nelly Group</strong></a> that you need to take into consideration.  </p><p> <strong>If P/E ratios interest you</strong>, you may wish to see this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16455/strong-past-earnings-growth-p-e-ratio-below-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.</a> </p></div>",

The drop over the last 30 days has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 23% in that time.   </p><p> Although its price has dipped substantially, you could still be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Icelandair Group hf's P/S ratio of 0.2x, since the median price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio for the Airlines industry in Iceland is also close to 0.4x.

Perhaps the market is expecting future revenue performance to only keep up with the broader industry, which has keeping the P/S in line with expectations.  If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.    </p> We don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>free </strong>report on Icelandair Group hf's</a> earnings, revenue and cash flow.  <h2> What Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/S?  </h2><p> There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the industry for P/S ratios like Icelandair Group hf's to be considered reasonable.  </p><p> Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 9.5% gain to the company's revenues.   This was backed up an excellent period prior to see revenue up by 45% in total over the last three years.  So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenues over that time.   </p> <p> Comparing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory with the industry's one-year growth forecast of 4.5% shows it's noticeably more attractive. </p><p> In light of this, it's curious that Icelandair Group hf's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies.  It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can maintain its recent growth rates.  </p> <h2> The Key Takeaway </h2><p> Following Icelandair Group hf's share price tumble, its P/S is just clinging on to the industry median P/S.      While the price-to-sales ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of revenue expectations. </p><p> We didn't quite envision Icelandair Group hf's P/S sitting in line with the wider industry, considering the revenue growth over the last three-year is higher than the current industry outlook.  When we see strong revenue with faster-than-industry growth, we can only assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/S ratio.  It appears some are indeed anticipating revenue instability, because the persistence of these recent medium-term conditions would normally provide a boost to the share price.     </p><p> And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/is/transportation/icse-iceair/icelandair-group-hf-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Icelandair Group hf </strong> </a> you should know about.   </p><p> If you're <strong>unsure about the strength of Icelandair Group hf's business</strong>, why not explore <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-business-fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals</a> for some other companies you may have missed. </p></div>",

If met, it would imply a decent 8.2% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months.      Mahindra Logistics is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of ₹7.42 per share.       In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of ₹70.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of ₹7.08 in 2026.        So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential following these results.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/transportation/nse-mahlog/mahindra-logistics-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Mahindra Logistics </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 8.1% to ₹389, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Mahindra Logistics analyst has a price target of ₹560 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at ₹279.   This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.    </p> <p> These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Mahindra Logistics' past performance and to peers in the same <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/in/industrials/logistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. It's clear from the latest estimates that Mahindra Logistics' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 17% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2026 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 14% p.a. over the past five years.    By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year.  It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Mahindra Logistics to grow faster than the wider industry.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Mahindra Logistics' earnings potential next year.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.  </p><p> Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

This dynamic sets the scene for a closer look at the assumptions fueling such a stance and what could be driving sentiment behind the current price.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Momentum in omnichannel growth, including robust international expansion (notably in China and other emerging markets) and digital channel strength, positions the brand to benefit from rising global middle-class demand, leading to higher topline revenue and improved operating leverage. Continuous innovation through shorter product lead times, rapid product cycles, and more frequent fashion and cultural collaborations is enabling Victoria's Secret to better respond to consumer preferences and cultural trends, resulting in higher regular-priced sales and mitigating promotional markdowns, supporting gross margin improvement.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/nm7aie17-global-expansion-and-inclusivity-will-create-future-opportunities-lyrp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p> Want to know why the fair value sits so far below the market price?
