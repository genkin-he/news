For Faraday Copper, this high P/B multiple is sitting against a backdrop of no reported revenue, a net loss of CA$25.97m and forecasts that the company will remain unprofitable over the next three years.</p> <p>Against its direct peers, Faraday Copper screens as good value on this metric, with its 20.9x P/B sitting below the peer average of 44.6x. However, when you widen the lens to the broader Canadian metals and mining industry, which sits at 3.8x, the same 20.9x looks expensive, suggesting the market is applying a much richer multiple than the wider group.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price to book of 20.9x (ABOUT RIGHT versus peers, OVERVALUED versus the wider industry)</strong></p> <p>However, you are still backing an exploration stage company with no revenue and a CA$25.97m net loss, so funding conditions or project setbacks could quickly challenge this pricing.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-fdy/faraday-copper-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Faraday Copper narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If this all feels finely balanced, it makes sense to look at the numbers yourself and move quickly to shape your own view.

The latest guidance for a fifth straight year of falling sales directly pressures the key short term catalyst, which is stabilizing subscriptions, while reinforcing the biggest risk: that demand for Peloton’s ecosystem continues to soften despite cost cuts and positive free cash flow.</p> <p>The most relevant update here is management’s fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of US$2.40–2.44 billion, which confirms another year of top line contraction. This guidance sits uncomfortably beside earlier hopes that new offerings in areas like holistic wellness and commercial partnerships could support a revenue base closer to flat, and it puts more weight on whether those initiatives can eventually slow subscription losses and revive member engagement.</p> <p>Yet behind the improving free cash flow, investors should be aware of the risk that ongoing hardware and subscription declines could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/consumer-durables/nasdaq-pton/peloton-interactive/34aujxkl-pton-major-product-overhaul-and-ai-integration-will-drive-user-experience-forward\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Peloton Interactive (it's free!)</a></p><p>Peloton Interactive's narrative projects $2.5 billion revenue and $113.2 million earnings by 2028.

As a result, recent profit strength sits alongside a much weaker longer term record.\n    <ul> <li>This recent period shows net income at roughly US$1.4b on US$70.4b of sales, while the longer run data points to a multi year earnings decline, so anyone with a bullish angle needs to square that contrast.</li> <li>At the same time, the 2.0% margin is still quite thin in absolute terms, which means even small changes in costs or pricing can move profit up or down quite quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth give bulls some evidence to point to, but the longer multi year earnings decline keeps the story more balanced than a simple recovery narrative suggests. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/SGX/F34\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Wilmar International.</strong></a></p> <h2>P/E of 12.3x sits between sector and peers</h2> <ul> <li>Wilmar trades on a P/E of 12.3x, which is cheaper than the Asian Food industry average of 16.1x but higher than a peer group average of 9.9x, so it sits in the middle of the pack on this simple earnings multiple.</li> <li>Critics highlight that even with this mid range P/E, there are clear financial pressure points, especially around interest coverage and dividends, that could justify the market keeping the shares on a discount to some food peers.\n    <ul> <li>The data flags that interest payments are not well covered by earnings, which can make a 12.3x multiple feel less comfortable than it looks against the wider industry at 16.1x.</li> <li>The dividend track record is described as unstable and dividend sustainability a concern, so income focused investors may treat the current yield and multiple more cautiously than a simple P/E comparison suggests.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF fair value sits well above the current price</h2> <ul> <li>The current share price of S$3.52 is well below a DCF fair value estimate of about S$6.60, and the dataset also notes that this implies the shares trade roughly 46.7% below that modelled value.</li> <li>Supporters of a more positive stance point to that DCF gap and the 20.6% trailing earnings growth as reasons to consider the stock undervalued, while the same numbers also sit alongside modest forecast growth of about 3.6% a year for earnings and 4.6% a year for revenue, which keeps expectations relatively low.\n    <ul> <li>The projected 3.6% earnings growth is below the Singapore market’s expected 7.5% earnings growth, so the DCF upside does not come with especially strong growth assumptions in these forecasts.</li> <li>Because the net margin is 2.0% on roughly US$70.4b of trailing revenue, even modest growth in sales or small margin shifts can move absolute profit by hundreds of millions of US$, which partly explains why a valuation model can land so far above the current share price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

Based on achieving a 30% global market share (up from the previous 25% conservative estimate), the projected Peak Annual Sales for TERN-701 increase to $4.5 Billion. This capture is driven by its anticipated dominance in 2L/3L CML and its eventual entry into the massive 1L market.<br/>• Probability of Success (PoS): The clinical data has significantly de-risked the program. The PoS is increased from 75% to a more confident 80%, reflecting the high likelihood of successful Phase 3 trials and regulatory approval.<br/>• Net Present Value (NPV) Factor: The robust clinical de-risking and the clear blockbuster status ($1B in sales) warrant a higher valuation multiple. The Program Value is calculated using a 5.0x Peak Sales Multiple (up from 3 to 5).</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/yicsbbfw-update-for-terns-pharmaceuticals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>If you want to see what is sitting behind that $98.57 figure, the narrative according to AverageSven leans heavily on long term CML sales, ambitious market share in multiple treatment lines, and a profitability profile that aims to justify a premium valuation multiple over time.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Campbell's current share price still reflects the value of a classic consumer brand, you are not alone. This article is built to help you size that up calmly.</li> <li>At a last close of US$26.86, the stock has seen a 0.4% decline over 7 days, a 1.9% decline over 30 days, and is down 3.1% year to date, with a 29.2% decline over 1 year and a 42.5% decline over 3 years.</li> <li>These moves sit against an ongoing stream of news around packaged food companies, including debates on pricing power, consumer demand for at home meals, and brand relevance in crowded supermarket aisles.

It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in today's terms.</p> <p>For Campbell's, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The last twelve months free cash flow is reported at about $658.3 million. Analysts supply forecasts for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extends those further, with ten year projections reaching $881.2 million in 2035, all in $ terms.</p> <p>When all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $59.35 per share. Compared with the recent share price of $26.86, this implies a 54.7% discount to that DCF estimate. This suggests that Campbell's may be trading below this particular assessment of its cash flow value.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Campbell's is undervalued by 54.7%.

It captures what the market is willing to pay today for those earnings, without needing detailed forecasts.</p> <p>What counts as a \"normal\" P/E depends a lot on how investors view a company's growth prospects and risk. Higher expected growth or perceived resilience can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher risk usually pulls it down.</p> <p>Campbell's currently trades on a P/E of 13.9x, compared with a Food industry average of 24.5x and a peer group average of 13.2x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" of 20.7x for Campbell's, which is the P/E level it might trade on given its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.</p> <p>This Fair Ratio can be more tailored than a simple comparison to peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the factors that make Campbell's different rather than assuming all companies deserve the same multiple. Set against the current P/E of 13.9x, the 20.7x Fair Ratio describes Campbell's shares as screening as undervalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-cpb/campbells/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:CPB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b9a9b32a-2584-4709-a4a3-d825b2a7a6f7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:CPB P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

As a result, your Fair Value view moves with the information, and you can quickly see if your story still lines up with how Campbell's is trading.</p> <p>For Campbell's, one investor might build a Narrative closer to the higher Fair Value views around US$55.33 that lean on stronger Snacks, premium products and supply chain efficiency. Another might sit near the more cautious US$26.00 Fair Value that leans on pressure from private labels, tariffs and slower processed food demand.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Bitmine Immersion Technologies at around US$20.44 is priced for its story or offering genuine value, you are not alone.</li> <li>The stock has seen a 2.4% gain over the last 7 days, a 30.3% decline over the past month, a 34.5% decline year to date, and a 263.3% return over the past year, which signals shifting views on its potential and risk.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Bitmine Immersion Technologies has focused on its role in immersion cooling and crypto related infrastructure, along with how that niche positioning can influence sentiment when crypto markets or related stocks are in focus. This backdrop helps explain why the share price can experience sharp moves in relatively short periods.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Bitmine Immersion Technologies currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2 out of 6</a>.

It is most useful when a company has a clear, sustainable dividend track record.</p> <p>For Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the model uses a recent dividend per share of US$0.01 and applies a 3.41% dividend growth rate, which is based on the risk free rate rather than company specific trends. The model also includes a reported return on equity of 59.96%, but no payout ratio is provided, so the link between earnings, reinvestment and dividends is unclear.</p> <p>Based on this input set, the DDM output suggests an intrinsic value of about US$0.18 per share. When compared with the current share price of around US$20.44, this framework describes the stock as very heavily overvalued, with an intrinsic discount figure of 11,130.3%.</p> <p>Given how sensitive the DDM is to small changes in dividend and growth assumptions, these results should be treated as a rough reference point rather than a precise target.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Dividend Discount Model (DDM) analysis suggests Bitmine Immersion Technologies may be overvalued by 11130.3%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-screener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"BMNR Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/dcf?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>BMNR Discounted Cash Flow as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Bitmine Immersion Technologies.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Bitmine Immersion Technologies Price vs Book</h3> <p>For companies where earnings are volatile or free cash flow is negative, the price to book, or P/B, ratio can be a more grounded way to think about value. It compares what the market is paying for each dollar of net assets to what sits on the balance sheet.</p> <p>In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/B multiple, while slower growth or higher risk often line up with a lower P/B. So the question is not whether a P/B is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Bitmine Immersion Technologies currently trades on a P/B of 0.83x. The wider Software industry sits around 2.71x, and the peer group average is 14.17x, so the stock is pricing its book value at a discount to both groups. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio concept goes a step further. It estimates the P/B you might expect after factoring in elements like earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, risk profile and the industry context, rather than relying on blunt comparisons.</p> <p>Because no Fair Ratio is available here, you cannot directly judge whether 0.83x points to overvaluation or undervaluation using that proprietary metric alone.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSEAM:BMNR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSEAM:BMNR P/B Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/B ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you tell the story behind your numbers by linking your view of Bitmine Immersion Technologies’ business to your own forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins. These then flow through to a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide if it looks attractive or stretched. Because Narratives update automatically when new news or earnings are released, you might see one investor setting a cautious fair value well below US$20.44 while another, more optimistic about crypto infrastructure, sets theirs well above that level.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Bitmine Immersion Technologies? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSEAM/BMNR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nysemkt-bmnr/bitmine-immersion-technologies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSEAM:BMNR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/289b4e26-1dda-41cc-8991-c204f4659a67/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSEAM:BMNR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

With margins now framed by a higher reported net margin and a large one off loss in the background, the latest print puts the focus firmly on how durable that profitability profile really is.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/real-estate-management-and-development/hkg-14/hysan-development-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Hysan Development.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the table, the next step is to see how these results line up against the key narratives around growth, risk, and income that have been shaping expectations for Hysan Development.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/mz19jazy-14-consistent-outlook-will-sustain-momentum-amid-stability-in-core-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Hysan Development</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/hk/real-estate-management-and-development/hkg-14/hysan-development-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"SEHK:14 Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/a012acf1-f3a5-4e13-bc90-fc88e1b130c6/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>SEHK:14 Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>HK$900m one off swings margin picture</h2> <ul> <li>Trailing 12 month net income excluding extra items sits at HK$840 million on HK$3,464 million of revenue, and that comes alongside a HK$900 million one off loss that materially shaped the reported 24.2% net margin versus 1.1% last year.</li> <li>Bulls argue that projects like Lee Garden Eight and the wider Lee Gardens ecosystem can support higher recurring rental income and margins. However, the size of that HK$900 million item and the move from a loss of HK$317 million in the prior 12 months to HK$840 million now means part of the earnings jump reflects clean up effects rather than just ongoing rental strength.\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to data driven loyalty programs and curated retail that are already linked with higher tenant sales and traffic, but these sit beside a period where basic EPS on a trailing basis moved from HK$0.03 to HK$0.31 with help from that one off adjustment.</li> <li>If you are leaning toward the bullish story, it is worth separating what comes from steady HK$3,326 million to HK$3,551 million revenue over the last few reported periods and what is tied to that HK$900 million event.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>P/E premium and 21.2% earnings growth forecast</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of HK$21.82, the trailing P/E of 26.7x sits well above both peers at 14.2x and the wider Hong Kong real estate industry at 14.4x, while earnings are forecast to grow about 21.2% per year and revenue is forecast at 3.7% annual growth versus 8.6% for the market.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points to a business that could lift earnings meaningfully over time, but the combination of a P/E almost double peer levels and revenue growth forecasts that trail the broader market invites questions about how much of that 21.2% earnings growth is already reflected in today’s HK$21.82 price.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts are effectively assuming stronger margins can do the heavy lifting, while the DCF fair value of HK$11.15 sits well below the current price, which suggests the market is comfortable paying up based on those margin assumptions.</li> <li>If you prefer to stress test that view, you might compare the current premium multiple and DCF fair value gap with what you would expect given revenue growth that is below the 8.6% market forecast.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On a strong earnings growth story priced at a 26.7x P/E, some investors want to see exactly how bullish analysts think this can go before they decide how to weigh that premium. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/1c6fv52l-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Hysan Development Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Debt coverage and dividend pressure</h2> <ul> <li>The company offers a 4.95% dividend yield, yet dividends are flagged as not well covered by earnings and debt is described as not well covered by operating cash flow, which makes the balance sheet a key watchpoint alongside the income stream.</li> <li>Bears highlight that weaker debt coverage and reliance on instruments like perpetual securities can leave less headroom if rental conditions stay tough, and the data here backs their focus because cash flow coverage of debt and dividend payout are both identified as pressure points rather than strengths.\n    <ul> <li>Critics also note that while trailing margins look strong at 24.2%, that sits beside concerns about refinancing costs and the need to keep funding projects like Lee Garden Eight and other developments.</li> <li>If you are weighing the cautious view, the combination of a near 5% yield, limited earnings cover, and flagged debt coverage risk gives you a clear list of financial items to track in the next few reporting periods.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> When dividends are not well covered and debt coverage is marked out as a risk, some investors prefer to walk through the cautious case in detail before committing fresh capital. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/40zdes1c-update-for-hysan-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Hysan Development Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/mz19jazy-14-consistent-outlook-will-sustain-momentum-amid-stability-in-core-metrics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Hysan Development on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Reading through this, you can probably sense both enthusiasm and caution in the story.

Short term, the key catalysts remain earnings delivery against the updated FY2025/26 guidance, the recently increased dividends, and how the market continues to price a low P/E against modest growth forecasts. The Ishikariwan Shinko Unit 2 acceleration fits into this by modestly reinforcing the investment story around supply stability, but it also underscores the ongoing need for heavy capex in a business where debt is not well covered by operating cash flow and dividend cover looks tight. Given the already strong share price gains, this project tweak looks more incremental than transformational to the near term risk‑reward.</p> However, investors should be aware of how rising capex could strain cash generation and dividends.\n\nHokkaido Electric Power Company's shares are on the way up, but they could be overextended by 35%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncover the fair value now</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/utilities/tse-9509/hokkaido-electric-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/c387b43e-a10f-4156-b065-ce343cad1687/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:9509 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> The single fair value estimate from the Simply Wall St Community centers tightly around ¥909.82 per share, contrasting with recent market pricing.

On one hand, HP outperformed expectations on both revenue and EPS, with net revenue of US$14.4b compared to US$13.5b a year earlier and non GAAP EPS above consensus. On the other, operating income fell and management is guiding toward the lower end of its full year earnings ranges as DRAM and NAND costs pressure margins. That combination often leads to short term share price weakness, which you are already seeing. However, it also gives you clearer information on how management plans to handle higher input costs through product re configuration, supplier diversification and selective price increases. The fact that HP maintained its fiscal 2026 GAAP EPS range of US$2.47 to US$2.77 while outlining a US$1b cost savings plan suggests management is trying to balance investment in AI PCs with disciplined capital returns, including US$0.6b returned in Q1 and continued buybacks. Against a backdrop of insider share sales and mixed institutional flows, this quarter is likely to be read as a test of whether HP can convert strong AI PC demand into durable earnings power rather than just a one off beat.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The HP Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The strong Q1, with AI PCs at more than one third of shipments and Personal Systems growth, supports the narrative that AI driven PCs and premium devices can underpin revenue and margin resilience.</li> <li>The sharp rise in memory costs and guidance toward the low end of EPS ranges challenges the view that cost restructuring alone can fully offset input cost pressure and structural headwinds in Print.</li> <li>The specific memory cost inflation and the US$1b mitigation plan through FY2028 add more detail on cost risks and timing that are only partially reflected in the existing narrative about restructuring and supply chain diversification.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/9fda6tiy-ai-demand-and-margin-pressures-will-shape-performance-amid-digital-sector-shifts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for HP</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Rising DRAM and NAND prices are creating a roughly US$0.30 full year EPS headwind, which could keep Personal Systems margins below the long term range if mitigation falls short.</li> <li>⚠️ Analysts and risk models highlight four key risk factors, including negative shareholders’ equity and concerns around dividend stability and leverage, which may limit how aggressive HP can be with buybacks and payouts.</li> <li>🎁 AI PCs already account for over 35% of shipments, supporting the view that HP can benefit if the PC refresh cycle and demand for higher spec devices continue to support the Personal Systems segment.</li> <li>🎁 Management is pursuing US$1b in gross run rate savings by FY2028 and has continued to return capital through buybacks and dividends, which some investors may see as supportive of per share metrics if executed carefully.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to track three things closely. First, how quickly memory cost inflation stabilises or is offset through supplier agreements, product design changes and pricing. Second, whether AI PC growth remains strong enough to support revenue and operating margins, especially compared with peers like Dell, Lenovo and Apple in higher end PCs.

This suggests recent news is being viewed as a significant shift in growth prospects and risk profile rather than a short term move.</p> <p>If this AI server and cooling story has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to look across the wider theme through our screen of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as potential contenders in the same structural trend.</p> <p>With the shares up sharply and trading slightly above the latest analyst price target, yet showing a large intrinsic discount on some models, the key question is whether 2CRSI is still mispriced or if the market is already pricing in years of growth.</p> <h2>Price to sales premium versus fair value and peers</h2> <p>On the numbers provided, 2CRSI looks inexpensive against the SWS DCF estimate yet expensive on its preferred multiple, which is the P/S ratio. The share last closed at €27.70, while the SWS DCF model estimates a future cash flow value of €53.34, and the shares are described as trading 48.1% below that fair value.</p> <p>The SWS DCF model works by projecting future cash flows for the business and discounting them back to today using a required rate of return. That approach tries to capture the specific earnings profile of 2CRSI, including factors such as forecast revenue and profit growth, rather than just comparing it to other tech names using a simple market multiple.</p> <p>Set against that, the preferred multiple being used here is the P/S ratio, which currently sits at 2.8x for 2CRSI. This is described as expensive compared to an estimated fair P/S ratio of 0.6x, and also expensive against the European tech industry average P/S of 0.7x, even though it is below a selected peer group average P/S of 4.3x. That mix of signals shows the market is already paying more per euro of sales than broad sector and regression based benchmarks, while still assigning a lower tag than some direct peers.</p> <p>Put simply, the P/S of 2.8x stands well above both the 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average. That represents strong relative pricing that investors will want to weigh against the large DCF gap. If the market ever moves closer to the SWS fair P/S level suggested by the regression work, that would imply a very different share price than today.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for 2CRSI</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-sales of 2.8x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you also need to factor in execution risks around turning €220.857m of revenue into stronger profitability, as well as the recent rapid share price swings.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/tech/epa-al2si/2crsi-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this 2CRSI narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view on what the price implies</h2> <p>While the P/S of 2.8x looks rich against a 0.6x fair ratio and the 0.7x European tech average, the SWS DCF model points the other way, with a fair value of €53.34 versus the current €27.70, described as 48.1% below fair value.
