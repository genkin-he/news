Kathwari plans to fix this.  At the next AGM coming up on 5th of November, they can influence managerial decision making through voting on resolutions, including executive remuneration.  Voting on executive pay could be a powerful way to influence management, as studies have shown that the right compensation incentives impact company performance.   We think CEO compensation looks appropriate given the data we have put together.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-etd/ethan-allen-interiors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Ethan Allen Interiors </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For M. Kathwari Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> Our data indicates that Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. has a market capitalization of US$717m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$3.8m for the year to June 2025.   We note that's an increase of 19% above last year.    We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.2m.  </p><p> For comparison, other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/consumer-discretionary/consumer-durables\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Consumer Durables industry</a> with market capitalizations ranging between US$400m and US$1.6b had a median total CEO compensation of US$6.3m.    In other words, Ethan Allen Interiors pays its CEO lower than the industry median.    What's more, M. Kathwari holds US$45m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2025</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2025)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$1.2m</td><td align=\"right\">US$1.2m</td><td align=\"center\">30%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$2.7m</td><td align=\"right\">US$2.1m</td><td align=\"center\">70%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$3.8m </td><td align=\"right\">US$3.2m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Speaking on an industry level, nearly 19% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 81% is other remuneration.    Ethan Allen Interiors is paying a higher share of its remuneration through a salary in comparison to the overall industry.    It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-etd/ethan-allen-interiors/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/28258-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761827355095\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NYSE:ETD CEO Compensation October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> A Look at Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.'s Growth Numbers  </h2><p> Over the last three years, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. has shrunk its earnings per share by 21% per year.     Its revenue is down 4.9% over the previous year.   </p><p> Few shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined.    And the impression is worse when you consider revenue is down year-on-year.   It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration.    Looking ahead, you might want to check <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-etd/ethan-allen-interiors/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this free visual report on <strong>analyst forecasts</strong> for the company's future earnings.</a>. </p> <h2>Has Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> With a total shareholder return of 29% over three years, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. shareholders would, in general, be reasonably content.  But they probably wouldn't be so happy as to think the CEO should be paid more than is normal, for companies around this size.   </p> <h2> To Conclude... </h2><p> Shareholder returns while positive, need to be looked at along with earnings, which have failed to grow and this could mean that the current momentum may not continue.   These are are some concerns that shareholders may want to address the board when they revisit their investment thesis.    </p><p> CEO pay is simply one of the many factors that need to be considered while examining business performance.

However, investors may find appeal in its attractive dividend, a favorable price-to-sales ratio relative to peers, and forecasts for above-average profit growth.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for BXP.</a> <p>Next, we will see how these earnings figures compare with the most widely held market narratives and whether the numbers reinforce or challenge the current story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/p9cdwcmx-gateway-office-demand-and-disposition-plans-will-shape-performance-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about BXP</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/66909603-076c-4562-bb5f-8014d41ea084/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Margin Expansion Forecast: Analysts See Net Margin Rising From 0.1% to 10%</h2> <ul> <li>Profit margins are projected to rise sharply over the next three years, from a negligible 0.1% today to 10% by 2028, as BXP targets a transition back to sustained profitability.</li> <li>Analysts’ consensus view expects margin growth will be driven by:\n    <ul> <li>A “flight to quality” trend is leading to higher occupancy rates and premium rents for BXP’s centrally located, modern assets.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it’s gotten too pricey? Let’s dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco’s new store openings and bold expansion plans. These moves reinforce its reputation for consistent growth. The excitement around its international push and updated membership offerings has investors debating whether recent price moves reflect new opportunities or fresh risks.</li> <li>Costco currently lands a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. By several standard checks, this suggests it may be fully valued or even pricey right now. Let’s break down exactly how we arrive at that score in the next section and, even more importantly, look at what makes for a smarter way to judge value that goes beyond traditional methods.</li> </ul> <p>Costco Wholesale scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today’s dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco’s intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company’s current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company’s share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company’s earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry’s average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco’s stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco’s PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco’s case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco’s current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco’s current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio. This means that, even after considering Costco’s growth, margins, and market-leading position, the stock appears to be overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1382 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers—such as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks—to your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company’s real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

While there were no major headlines driving movement, investors continue to weigh the homebuilder’s recent performance and broader housing sector sentiment.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-kbh/kb-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for KB Home.</a></p> <p>After strong gains earlier in the year, momentum for KB Home has been mixed, with shares up about 13% over the past 90 days but still posting a one-year total shareholder return of -18.7%. This suggests investors are weighing near-term housing headwinds against the company’s longer-term track record. The company continues to maintain multi-year total returns well above the sector norm.</p> <p>If you’re curious where else opportunity might be building, now is a great time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>This raises an important question for investors: Is KB Home currently trading at an attractive valuation given its long-term record, or has the market already factored in all future growth prospects?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3% Undervalued</h2> <p>Compared to its recent close at $62.71, the most popular narrative puts KB Home's fair value at $64.67.

The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit.  Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.  While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. </p><p> If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in <strong>DTS</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TSE:9682</a>).

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.   Impressively, DTS has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.    EBIT margins for DTS remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to JP¥130b.  That's progress.   </p><p> The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So it is good to see that DTS insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock.     Holding JP¥9.8b worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders.   That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.   </p> <h2> Should You Add DTS To Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that DTS has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.     You still need to take note of risks, for example - DTS has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/software/tse-9682/dts-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> </a> we think you should be aware of.  </p><p> While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a carefully selected list of companies in JP with promising growth potential and insider confidence.</a> </p><p><em>Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.</em></p></div>",

While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution.  When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  As a result, we can surmise that the unusual items are making its statutory profit significantly stronger than it would otherwise be.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/real-estate-management-and-development/sto-joma/john-mattson-fastighetsforetagen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As we discussed above, we think the significant positive unusual item makes John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's earnings a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that John Mattson Fastighetsföretagen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    The good news is that it earned a profit in the last twelve months, despite its previous loss.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> With its stock down 23% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC (ADX:TKFL).   However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at.     In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's </a> ROE.   </p><p> ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.

Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE </h2><p> On the face of it, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's ROE is not much to talk about.   However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 13%, is definitely interesting.   Still, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth of 4.7% over the past five years was mediocre at best.  Remember, the company's ROE is quite low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average.  Hence, this goes some way in explaining the low earnings growth.    </p><p> We then compared Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same 5-year period.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/22519534-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761798779706\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADX:TKFL Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC fairly valued compared to other companies? These <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ae/insurance/adx-tkfl/abu-dhabi-national-takaful-company-psc-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 valuation measures</a> might help you decide.   </p><h2> Is Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?  </h2> <p> While Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%), it has seen very little growth in earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Moreover, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.   </p> <h2> Conclusion  </h2> <p> In total, we are pretty happy with Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company PSC's performance.      Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.        If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices.  Remember, the price of a stock is also dependent on the perceived risk. Therefore investors must keep themselves informed about the risks involved before investing in any company.

Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 33% over that time.   </p><p> Although its price has surged higher, Lachish Industries may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 11.8x, since almost half of all companies in Israel have P/E ratios greater than 17x and even P/E's higher than 29x are not unusual.

One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think the company won't do enough to avoid underperforming the broader market in the near future.

Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 178% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance.  Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.   </p> <p> Weighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 22% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis. </p><p> In light of this, it's peculiar that Lachish Industries' P/E sits below the majority of other companies.  Apparently some shareholders believe the recent performance has exceeded its limits and have been accepting significantly lower selling prices.  </p> <h2> The Bottom Line On Lachish Industries' P/E </h2><p> Despite Lachish Industries' shares building up a head of steam, its P/E still lags most other companies.      Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects. </p><p> We've established that Lachish Industries currently trades on a much lower than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is higher than the wider market forecast.  There could be some major unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching this positive performance.  At least price risks look to be very low if recent medium-term earnings trends continue, but investors seem to think future earnings could see a lot of volatility.     </p><p> It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years).  In fact, during that period, the share price climbed 321%. Impressive!  So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one.  Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.     </p><p> Since it's been a strong week for Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/282/quantum-computing-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.</a></p> <p> In his essay <em>The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville</em> Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Victory Securities (Holdings), it has a TSR of 341% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return. </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> It's nice to see that Victory Securities (Holdings) shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 73% over the last year.   And that does include the dividend.     That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately.  In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.        It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Victory Securities (Holdings) better, we need to consider many other factors.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company’s efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company’s dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.
