Over the past few periods, the group has seen revenue move from €4.5b in H2 2024 to €3.7b in H1 2025 and then €4.4b in H2 2025. Basic EPS shifted from €2.41 in H2 2024 to effectively flat at €0.01 in H1 2025 before rebounding to €8.28 in the latest half, leaving investors to weigh a low 1.6% trailing net margin against the potential rewards implied by the current €52.15 share price and the earnings profile behind it.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-sk/seb-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for SEB.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to line these results up against the most widely held narratives about SEB and see which stories the data supports and which ones start to look stretched.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3l7dzj-analysts-lower-seb-valuation-after-weaker-guidance-and-softer-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about SEB</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-sk/seb-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ENXTPA:SK Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b48dca4c-76ed-4095-9b51-1126ce7caf17/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>ENXTPA:SK Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Margins Feel Tight At 1.6% Net Level</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, SEB earned €244.6 million of net income on €8.2b of revenue, which works out to a 1.6% net margin compared with 5% a year earlier.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about better margins over time, yet the latest 1.6% margin and the €229.4 million one off loss show that current profitability is still thin compared with the higher margin profile analysts have in mind.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts are working with earnings today of €132.7 million moving to €529.7 million, so the current margin level is well below what that path assumes.</li> <li>With revenue growth at about 2.2% over the last year, the pressure on margins rather than top line is what stands out against the more optimistic margin expansion story.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Signals Point In Different Directions</h2> <ul> <li>At a €52.15 share price and a P/E of 21.8x versus peers at 20.4x and the industry at 15.8x, the stock trades on richer earnings multiples while sitting below a DCF fair value of €193.35 and below an analyst target of €75.64.</li> <li>Bulls highlight the gap between the €52.15 price and both the €75.64 target and the DCF fair value of €193.35. However, the higher P/E than peers together with a 1.6% margin means the current valuation already reflects better earnings quality than the recent numbers actually show.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish case leans on earnings growing from €132.7 million to €544.2 million, yet trailing earnings were shaped by that €229.4 million one off loss and weaker margins, which keeps the quality of the base year in focus.</li> <li>What stands out is that even with modest 2.2% revenue growth, the market is assigning a higher P/E than the industry, so any delay in the margin recovery that bulls expect could leave the stock looking expensive on current earnings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Have a look at how bullish analysts join the dots between these compressed margins and their longer term growth case for SEB. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/vegkxk4o-update-for-seb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 SEB Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>Debt, Cash Flow And The 5.31% Dividend</h2> <ul> <li>The company is paying a 5.31% dividend, while earnings and free cash flow are flagged as not covering that payout and operating cash flow is described as weak relative to debt obligations.</li> <li>Bears focus on this combination of a 5.31% yield with weak debt coverage, arguing it puts pressure on cash generation, and the trailing 1.6% margin plus the large one off loss back up that concern by showing how little buffer there was in the last 12 months.\n    <ul> <li>With €8.2b of trailing revenue only turning into €244.6 million of net income, there is not a big cushion to comfortably support both debt service and a high payout if earnings stay at these levels.</li> <li>Critics point out that if revenue growth stays close to the recent 2.2% rate while margins remain low, management may have limited room to both reduce debt and maintain the current dividend profile.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing that 5.31% yield against the debt and margin picture, it is worth seeing how skeptics frame the downside case. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/63terjg3-update-for-seb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 SEB Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cu3l7dzj-analysts-lower-seb-valuation-after-weaker-guidance-and-softer-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for SEB on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of cautious and optimistic signals feels hard to balance, take a moment to look through the data yourself and form your own view, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/fr/consumer-durables/epa-sk/seb-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 key rewards and 4 important warning signs</a>.</p> <h2>See What Else Is Out There</h2> <p>SEB is working with tight 1.6% margins, a large one off loss and a 5.31% dividend that is not covered by earnings or free cash flow.</p> <p>If stretched margins and a heavily committed payout make you uneasy, focus on companies with stronger cushions and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_solid_balance_sheet\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solid balance sheet and fundamentals stocks screener (374 results)</a> today.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Analysts have provided forecasts that feed into a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with Simply Wall St extending the projections further out. Within that framework, projected Free Cash Flow for 2035 is $1,014.98 million, based on a mix of analyst inputs and extrapolated estimates.</p> <p>When all those forecast cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of around $812.41 per share. Versus a recent share price near $597, this suggests the stock is trading at roughly a 26.5% discount to that DCF estimate. On this cash flow based approach, the model result indicates that CACI may be undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CACI International is undervalued by 26.5%.

It reflects both what the market thinks of those earnings today and how it is weighing the risks around them.</p> <p>Higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk usually support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tend to pull a “normal” or “fair” P/E lower. CACI International currently trades on a P/E of about 25.4x. That sits above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x, but below the peer group average of around 28.0x.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for CACI is 27.2x, which is its proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E might be given the company’s earnings characteristics, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This can be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for factors that can differ meaningfully between companies. With the current P/E of 25.4x sitting modestly below the Fair Ratio of 27.2x, the multiple suggests the stock may be undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-caci/caci-international/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1429557d-de3e-47fa-b954-56434f5f9dd9/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The stock trades at $39.09, with a value score of 3 and multi year returns that include 47.7% over 3 years and 292.0% over 5 years, which outlines how the market has already been pricing the company. The recent 30 day return of 9.3% and year to date gain of 10.7% show that the shares have had some momentum into this news.</p> <p>The higher dividend and 10 year supply contract both indicate management’s view on cash generation and the durability of demand for its gas. As you assess NYSE:RRC, these developments may matter if you care about visibility on future cash flows and income potential, especially compared with other energy names that do not combine dividend changes with long term offtake agreements.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-rrc/range-resources/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Range Resources</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>The 11% increase in Range Resources’ quarterly dividend to US$0.10 per share, or US$0.40 annualized, comes right after a year where the company reported higher revenue and net income for 2025 and generated over US$650m in free cash flow. For you as a shareholder, the timing matters because management is pairing the dividend move with a larger buyback authorization and a 10 year gas sales contract to a Midwest power plant, which together point to confidence in future cash generation and demand visibility. The contract ties a slice of production to a single large customer, which can smooth volumes compared with fully spot exposure.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Range Resources Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The long term power-plant contract supports the narrative that regional demand from power and data center loads can underpin Range Resources’ Marcellus-focused gas strategy.</li> <li>The step up in shareholder returns, including the dividend increase and expanded repurchase program, could test the narrative if capital needs for drilling and processing expansions turn out higher than expected.</li> <li>The specific 10 year offtake agreement to a Midwest power plant, and its contract terms, are not fully captured in the broader narrative around LNG exports and data center demand.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0cxwm1v1-rrc-medium-term-demand-from-lng-exports-and-datacenters-will-drive-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Range Resources</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A larger recurring cash dividend reduces flexibility if future drilling or processing costs rise faster than expected.</li> <li>⚠️ Concentration in Appalachia and reliance on power and LNG-linked demand leave Range Resources exposed if regional prices or regulatory conditions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A higher dividend combined with a US$1.5b buyback capacity signals that recent free cash flow levels have given the board confidence in returning capital.</li> <li>🎁 The 10 year gas supply agreement offers long term volume visibility that many peers such as EQT and Chesapeake Energy may not have to the same contract-specific extent.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how the new dividend compares with free cash flow over the next few quarters, especially as Range Resources spends US$650m to US$700m on its 2026 capital program. The key questions are whether the company keeps covering the dividend and buybacks from cash generated, how liquids stay above 30% of production as guided, and whether the Midwest contract meaningfully affects realized pricing. It is also worth tracking any changes in analyst views on the stock, given the recent cluster of Hold ratings and target tweaks, to see if this capital return move changes perceptions of risk and return.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Range Resources, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/RRC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Range Resources</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis. In the very near term, the key catalyst is the upcoming Q4 2025 earnings release, while the biggest risk remains a sharp correction in charter rates if trade routes normalize or demand softens.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement to this dividend is the declared timetable for Q4 2025 results on March 5, 2026, which now lands just one day before the payout date. That puts the dividend, capital return story, and fresh earnings data right next to each other on the calendar, potentially sharpening investor focus on how effectively Global Ship Lease is turning its contracted backlog and recent fleet additions into sustainable free cash flow and ongoing shareholder distributions.</p> <p>But against this backdrop, investors should also be aware of the risk that tighter environmental rules could force costly upgrades or early scrapping of older ships...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-gsl/global-ship-lease/foinmbvw-midsize-container-ships-will-improve-efficiency-despite-market-headwinds-fx8t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Global Ship Lease (it's free!)</a></p><p>Global Ship Lease's narrative projects $621.0 million revenue and $270.6 million earnings by 2028.

On the deployment side, any further comments on Australian regulation, operating costs, or additional redeployments could signal how flexible Carnival is willing to be with its global footprint compared with peers.

At the same time, the 1 year total shareholder return is 34.37%, which suggests that recent momentum has faded after a strong prior run.</p> <p>If this earnings setback has you reassessing growth stories in tech hardware, it could be a good moment to widen your search and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_ai_infrastructure\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473744/ai-infrastructure-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">33 AI infrastructure stocks</a> as another way to find potential opportunities.</p> <p>With Impinj shares down sharply after cautious guidance but still up 34.37% over the past year, the key question now is simple: are you looking at a reset that leaves the stock undervalued, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 49.1% Undervalued</h2> <p>Impinj last closed at $122.83 while the most followed narrative pegs fair value around $241.11, setting up a wide gap for investors to examine.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Expanding deployment of RFID solutions for food traceability and freshness especially at the item level driven by pilots with major retailers presents a multi-year growth opportunity. This trend is underpinned by regulatory and consumer demand for improved traceability and waste reduction, which is already leading to additional pilot programs and is expected to ramp into meaningful unit volumes in 2026 and beyond, supporting outsized future revenue growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/hia05y9t-analysts-raise-impinj-price-target-as-guidance-and-valuation-metrics-show-stability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what justifies that higher fair value? The narrative leans heavily on fast compounding revenues, rising profit margins, and a premium future earnings multiple.

At 10.3x sales versus a fair ratio of 7.4x, the shares look expensive, and also pricier than the US Semiconductor industry at 6.2x and peers at 5.9x. The question is whether the discount to fair value is real, or simply a function of optimistic growth assumptions.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-pi/impinj/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-pi/impinj/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:PI P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61b82bc4-6ec3-4fe6-9c2c-521c7acc424c/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:PI P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Mixed messages on value and risk here, right?

This means:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the recent turnaround can point to Q2 to Q4 basic EPS between roughly US$1.01 and US$2.19 as evidence that profitability has held above early 2024 levels in recent quarters.</li> <li>The longer term decline in earnings growth rate, despite the strong trailing 12 month print, shows the bullish story is relying heavily on the latest year rather than a multi year pattern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong recent profits sit next to a weaker multi year track record, and that tension is exactly what many investors are trying to weigh up right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/INVA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Innoviva.</strong></a></p> <h2>One off gain inflates 65.9% margin</h2> <ul> <li>The reported 65.9% trailing net profit margin is much higher than the 6.5% margin a year earlier, and the data attributes a US$161.6 million one off gain as a key factor, so a large slice of the margin is tied to a single item rather than repeatable operations.</li> <li>Critics highlight that the very large year over year earnings improvement, described as more than a tenfold jump, is hard to treat as a new normal when:\n    <ul> <li>The one off gain of US$161.6 million fed directly into the trailing 12 month net income of US$271.2 million, which means a material portion of that profit is non recurring.</li> <li>The same data set shows analysts expecting earnings to decline by about 0.8% per year over the next three years, so the bearish view is that the spike in margins does not line up with the more muted outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>“Cheap” 6.5x P/E versus 19.9x industry</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$23.54, the trailing P/E of 6.5x sits well below both the reported US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.9x and a peer average of 17.7x, while the DCF fair value cited for Innoviva is US$53.96, which is much higher than the current price.</li> <li>What is interesting for the more cautious, bearish narrative is that this discount exists alongside softer longer term earnings trends and forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Earnings across the last five years declined at about 22.1% per year, even though the most recent trailing 12 month period shows very strong profit, so the low P/E is being judged on a high earnings base that includes a large one off gain.</li> <li>Revenue is forecast to grow at 9.5% per year, slightly below the 10.4% reference rate for the US market, which bears use to argue that the apparent valuation gap may be partly explained by more modest growth expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are weighing that low 6.5x P/E against the earnings record and forecasts, the community discussion is a helpful next step. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

However, the 90-day share price return shows a 5.09% decline, which contrasts with a 1-year total shareholder return of 142.68%. This indicates that long-term momentum remains intact even as shorter-term sentiment has been choppy.</p> <p>If this kind of regulatory milestone has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist and check out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_healthcare_ai\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434426/healthcare-ai/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">29 healthcare AI stocks</a> as another source of potential ideas.</p> <p>With Savara still loss making and trading at US$5.97 against an average analyst price target of US$10.81, you have to ask: is there genuine upside here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>Preferred Price-to-Book Multiple of 15.6x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>On a simple yardstick, Savara’s current P/B of 15.6x sets a high bar, especially with the company still loss making and generating less than $1m in revenue.</p> <p>P/B compares the market value of the company to the book value of its net assets, so a higher multiple usually reflects strong expectations for future value creation rather than current profitability.</p> <p>Here, the disconnect is clear: earnings are negative, losses have grown at around 20.3% per year over the past 5 years, and there is no meaningful current revenue. Yet the market is assigning a premium that suggests investors are heavily focused on future growth potential and the aPAP opportunity rather than today’s financials.</p> <p>That premium also stands out against peers. Savara’s 15.6x P/B is described as expensive versus both the US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x and a peer average of 12.1x, implying the market is paying a significantly richer multiple than is typical for the space.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 15.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the risk that the company remains loss making, with net income of $115.645m in the red and no current revenue base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Savara narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>With sentiment clearly split between the risks and the potential upside, it makes sense to act now and review the numbers for yourself, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If you are serious about sharpening your watchlist, do not stop at one stock story, use the Simply Wall St screener to uncover ideas you might otherwise miss.</p> <ul> <li>Spot potential value opportunities early by scanning companies on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> list that pair quality fundamentals with prices that may not fully reflect them.</li> <li>Strengthen your defensive side by reviewing companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> that score well on stability and downside protection.</li> <li>Get ahead of the crowd by checking the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undiscovered_gems\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473622/high-quality-undiscovered-gems/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">screener containing 24 high quality undiscovered gems</a> where strong fundamentals have yet to attract broad attention.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Recent results highlight a strong rebound, while still leaving the longer multi year weakness very visible.\n    <ul> <li>Bears often focus on that 46.7% annual decline in earnings over five years as a sign of pressure on the business, and that signal is clearly present in the data.</li> <li>At the same time, the step up in net income to US$180.1 million over the last 12 months shows that, at least recently, profitability has been materially stronger than the prior year despite that long run decline.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Revenue Base Above US$1.1b</h2> <ul> <li>Zimplats has generated US$1.1b of trailing twelve month revenue, compared with recent half year revenue points of US$350.2 million in H1 2025, US$394.3 million in H2 2024 and US$476.4 million in H2 2025, so investors can now see performance over a larger revenue base than any single half.</li> <li>For investors leaning toward a more bullish stance, the combination of a US$1.1b revenue base and 16.1% net margin strongly supports the idea that the current earnings profile is being earned on sizeable sales rather than just a one off shift.\n    <ul> <li>The move in half year revenue from US$394.3 million in H2 2024 to US$476.4 million in H2 2025 provides context for how the business reached the US$1.1b trailing revenue level.</li> <li>TTM net income of US$180.1 million set against that US$1.1b revenue shows that each dollar of sales has recently been converting into profit at a much higher rate than the earlier 2.8% margin period.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the last year, Zimplats has shifted from low margins on a smaller revenue base to a 16.1% margin on US$1.1b of revenue. This is exactly the kind of pivot bullish investors often look for in earnings stories. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/ASX/ZIM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Zimplats Holdings.</strong></a> <h2>P/E of 8.9x Versus Industry 23.1x</h2> <ul> <li>At the current share price of A$20.90, Zimplats trades on a trailing P/E of 8.9x, sitting below the Australian Metals &amp; Mining industry average of 23.1x, below the peer average of 22.2x and below the broader Australian market on 20.4x.</li> <li>What is interesting for valuation focused bulls is that this lower 8.9x P/E sits alongside the recent 16.1% net margin and US$180.1 million of trailing net income, which heavily supports the bullish claim that the shares are priced below many peers on past earnings even after a very large rebound in profitability.\n    <ul> <li>The gap between 8.9x and the 23.1x industry average suggests the market is applying a clear discount to Zimplats relative to other metals and mining names using trailing earnings.</li> <li>Given the multi year 46.7% annual earnings decline, that discount can also be read as the market weighing the risk of those weaker years against the recent improvement, which is a key tension for both bullish and bearish investors to consider.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-d08486b0-3 byoTNg\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>If you are wondering whether Ventas shares still offer value after a strong run, it becomes crucial to look closely at what you are paying for each dollar of cash flow and assets.</li> <li>The stock last closed at US$86.44, with returns of 1.1% over 7 days, 13.8% over 30 days, 11.8% year to date, 29.4% over 1 year, 99.7% over 3 years and 92.0% over 5 years. This naturally raises questions about how much optimism is already reflected in the price.</li> <li>Recent coverage of Ventas has focused on its position in the healthcare focused real estate space and how investors view the resilience of that segment relative to other property types. This context matters because sentiment around healthcare real estate, interest rates and capital allocation can all feed directly into how the stock trades.</li> <li>On our simple 6 point valuation checklist, Ventas currently scores <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-vtr/ventas/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3 out of 6</a>.

The latest twelve month free cash flow figure is about $1.62b. Analysts provide explicit estimates for the next few years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further out to build a 10 year path of cash flows.</p> <p>On this basis, projected free cash flow for 2030 is $2.27b, with interim annual figures between 2026 and 2035 ranging from roughly $1.55b to $2.92b before discounting. After bringing all those future amounts back to today at an appropriate discount rate, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$108.17 per share.</p> <p>Compared with the recent share price of US$86.44, this DCF output implies the stock is about 20.1% undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Ventas is undervalued by 20.1%.

Higher expected growth or a business model seen as lower risk often comes with a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty can justify a lower one.</p> <p>Ventas currently trades on a P/S of 7.06x. This sits very close to the Health Care REITs industry average of 7.04x and slightly below the peer group average of 7.78x, so on a simple comparison, the stock does not look extreme either way.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Ventas is 5.92x. This is a proprietary estimate of what P/S might be reasonable once you factor in elements such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and company specific risks. Because it blends these company characteristics, it can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 5.92x with the current 7.06x P/S suggests Ventas shares are trading above that fair level.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-vtr/ventas/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VTR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/dd658e0b-e85f-4fb9-96db-bc84ffa2ae83/chart/ps-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VTR P/S Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/S ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Ventas into a simple story that ties your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast. They map that forecast into a Fair Value you can compare with the current share price to decide whether you see it as an opportunity or something to avoid right now. They then keep that view fresh by updating automatically on Simply Wall St’s Community page when new earnings or news arrive. For example, one investor might build a Narrative around analyst assumptions that Ventas could reach $6.9b in revenue and $443.6m in earnings by about 2028 with a future P/E of 91.1x and conclude that a Fair Value around US$89.50 is reasonable. Another investor might focus on risks like competition, acquisition execution and labor costs and choose more cautious forecasts and a lower Fair Value. This gives you two clear stories and two different ways to act on the same stock.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Ventas? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/VTR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-vtr/ventas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:VTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/dd658e0b-e85f-4fb9-96db-bc84ffa2ae83/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:VTR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.
