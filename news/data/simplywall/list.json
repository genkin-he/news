The recent shipment of B1 QSE-5 samples, featuring the Cobra separator process, marks a concrete milestone and feeds optimism around near-term catalysts like automotive partnerships and real-world testing. For shareholders, the path forward is still shaped by critical questions: Can QuantumScape translate technical advances into scaled production and repeat customer billings? While the first-ever revenue of US$12.8 million and reduced losses are positive, the stock’s volatility and high price-to-book ratio show that market confidence is still very sensitive to incremental progress. With management highlighting cash runway into 2029, the operational risks now center on production ramp-up and achieving automotive-grade reliability, areas directly influenced by these recent developments. If the Eagle Line pilot and ongoing collaborations deliver, the balance of risk and reward may begin to shift, but uncertainty about when significant revenues will follow remains front and center for most investors.\n<br/> Yet with all this momentum, the risk around scaling to full automotive-grade reliability still looms large.\n</p> QuantumScape's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out how large the opportunity might be</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/automobiles/nyse-qs/quantumscape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/be3f5016-19bf-4bc6-b5ac-31a802792b25/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>QS Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Thirty-two members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate fair value from US$3.78 to US$37.80 per share, illustrating a broad spectrum of investor views.

To get the accrual ratio we first subtract FCF from profit for a period, and then divide that number by the average operating assets for the period.  This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow. </p><p> Therefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive.  While it's not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow.  To quote a 2014 paper by Lewellen and Resutek, \"firms with higher accruals tend to be less profitable in the future\". </p><p> Colgate-Palmolive (India) has an accrual ratio of -0.16 for the year to September 2025.   That indicates that its free cash flow quite significantly exceeded its statutory profit.    In fact, it had free cash flow of ₹14b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of ₹13.3b.    Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.  </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/household/nse-colpal/colgate-palmolive-india-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s Profit Performance</h2><p> Happily for shareholders, Colgate-Palmolive (India) produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers.      Because of this, we think Colgate-Palmolive (India)'s underlying earnings potential is as good as, or possibly even better, than the statutory profit makes it seem!     And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years.     Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors.     With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits.  Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. </p><h2> A Side By Side comparison of Stove Kraft's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE </h2><p> It is hard to argue that Stove Kraft's ROE is much good in and of itself.   An industry comparison shows that the company's ROE is not much different from the industry average of 8.9% either.   Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 10% seen by Stove Kraft over the last five years is not surprising.    </p><p> However, when we compared Stove Kraft's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 16% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/9674015-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761871371113\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NSEI:STOVEKRAFT Past Earnings Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.  What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/consumer-durables/nse-stovekraft/stove-kraft-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Stove Kraft is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Stove Kraft Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> When we piece together Stove Kraft's low three-year median payout ratio of 25% (where it is retaining 75% of its profits), calculated for the last three-year period, we are puzzled by the lack of growth.  This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings.  So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.   </p> <p> Only recently, Stove Kraft stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years.   The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> Overall, we have mixed feelings about Stove Kraft.      While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. </p> <p> Korean Reinsurance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Korean Reinsurance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874912-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761871433884\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A003690 Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p> Korean Reinsurance is not owned by hedge funds.      Our data shows that In-Soon Jang is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding.       Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.      Additionally, the company's CEO Jong-Gyu Won directly holds 5.1% of the total shares outstanding.   </p> <p> On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.  </p> <p> While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing.   Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  </p><h2>Insider Ownership Of Korean Reinsurance</h2><p> While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. </p><p> Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. </p> <p> It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Korean Reinsurance Company.   It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful ₩446b stake in this ₩1.9t business.  Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/insurance/kose-a003690/korean-reinsurance-shares/ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a> </p> <h2>General Public Ownership</h2><p> The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Korean Reinsurance.   This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. </p> <h2>Next Steps:</h2><p> It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Korean Reinsurance better, we need to consider many other factors. </p> <p> <strong>I like to dive deeper</strong> into how a company has performed in the past.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses.  A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. </p><p> So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like <strong>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/in/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nse-drreddy/dr-reddys-laboratories-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NSE:DRREDDY</a>).

That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors.   It certainly is nice to see that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has managed to grow EPS by 24% per year over three years.   If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.   </p><p> Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market.    While we note Dr. Reddy's Laboratories achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to ₹342b.  That's a real positive.   </p><p> You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company.     Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at ₹268b.   Coming in at 27% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders.  So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.   </p> <h2> Does Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? </h2><p> You can't deny that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive.   This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares.  On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research.

This highlights how investors are pricing in both sector-wide headwinds and company-specific concerns relative to direct competitors.</li> <li>This supports the view that ongoing sector stress and company risks are being partially balanced by potential for improved contract visibility.\n    <ul> <li>The industry discount reflects bears’ focus on lack of profitability and growth, while the premium to peers supports those watching for operational resilience or market recovery tailwinds.</li> <li>Bears continue to cite stagnant profitability and the company’s financial position as reasons for trading below broader sector multiples, while the ratio implies some hope that conditions could shift favorably if effective fleet or contract moves materialize.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>No Evidence of Growth or High-Quality Earnings</h2> <ul> <li>There is not sufficient data to assess SEACOR Marine’s expected revenue or earnings growth, and filings offer no evidence of high-quality past earnings.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding <em>base</em> of capital employed.  Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return.    So when we looked at the ROCE trend of <strong>SK hynix</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">KRX:000660</a>) we really liked what we saw.    </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

Analysts use this formula to calculate it for SK hynix: </p><p> <strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong> </p><p>0.31 = ₩32t ÷ (₩129t - ₩25t) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025)</em>.</p><p> So, <strong>SK hynix has an ROCE of 31%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.   </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for SK hynix </a></span></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"roce\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-1 fOFOtB\" height=\"632\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883357-roce-1-dark-2/1761871556004\" width=\"666\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">KOSE:A000660 Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> In the above chart we have measured SK hynix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last  five years to 31%.  The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 74%.  So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at SK hynix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.   </p><h2> The Bottom Line On SK hynix's ROCE </h2><p> To sum it up, SK hynix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific.       And a remarkable 601% total return over the last  five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future.   In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if SK hynix can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.   </p><p> One more thing to note, we've identified <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/kr/semiconductors/kose-a000660/sk-hynix-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign </strong> with SK hynix </a>and understanding this should be part of your investment process.   </p><p> If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.</a> </p></div>",

That single transaction was for AU$1.5m worth of shares at a price of AU$1.17 each.    That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$0.86.  It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.  We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares.   As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.     </p> <p> While Duxton Farms insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell.    You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.   It appears that Duxton Farms insiders own 34% of the company, worth about AU$13m.  We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  </p><h2> What Might The Insider Transactions At Duxton Farms Tell Us? </h2><p> The recent insider purchases are heartening.    We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions.   But on the other hand, the company made a loss during the last year, which makes us a little cautious.    When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Duxton Farms insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low.      While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

The latest series of announcements, including long-term nuclear collaborations and the lease of flexible gas turbines, significantly bolster the odds that Fermi can move from concept to initial power generation as early as 2026. These partnerships with global engineering leaders and supportive local government agreements address some of the biggest short-term execution risks by securing technology, fuel, water, and tax incentives, which were major question marks before. The near-term catalyst remains delivery of the first 500 MW of generation capacity, while successful project execution and revenue generation are now even more critical milestones. However, given Fermi’s lack of revenue, unproven business model, and very new management team, material risks still exist despite recent optimism and price gains driven largely by sentiment rather than underlying results.\nBut investors should remember: management experience remains a key issue for a business at this scale.\n</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Our expertly prepared valuation report on Fermi</a> implies its share price may be too high.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nasdaq-frmi/fermi/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cf0e1010-6f0a-428b-ae71-d75e592ca2cd/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FRMI Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$3.50 to US$35 per share.
