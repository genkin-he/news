Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have declined at an average annual rate of 8.8%. The stock trades at $11.07, giving it a Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 70.7x, which is well above the peer average of 12x and the US Banks industry average of 11x. Its share price remains higher than the estimated fair value of $8.97.

This method gives a sense of what the stock should be worth based on its future earnings potential, not just its current profits.</p> <p>For Harmonic, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $119.2 Million, highlighting a healthy level of cash generation. According to analyst estimates and model extrapolation, free cash flow in 2026 is projected to be $69.7 Million, with a decline over the next decade to around $35 Million by 2035. While analysts typically offer cash flow projections only a few years out, the model extends these estimates to provide a longer-term view.</p> <p>Based on these projections, Harmonic’s intrinsic value is calculated as $5.15 per share. With the current share price at more than double this figure, the DCF model indicates the stock is about 107% overvalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Harmonic may be overvalued by 107.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 839 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Harmonic.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Harmonic Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies like Harmonic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used methods for stock valuation. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, making it a practical gauge of market sentiment and perceived potential.</p> <p>Typically, a company with strong growth prospects or lower risk will command a higher PE ratio, while those facing uncertainty warrant a lower multiple. Factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends all play crucial roles in shaping what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE for a particular business.</p> <p>At present, Harmonic trades at a PE ratio of 17.6x. This is significantly below both the peer average of 28.9x and the communications industry average of 33.5x. This suggests the market is pricing in more caution or slower growth for Harmonic. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio model, which uniquely considers the company’s growth forecasts, profit margins, risks, industry, and market cap, calculates Harmonic’s fair PE at 22.9x. Unlike simply comparing to peers or industry, the Fair Ratio fine-tunes expectations to the individual company traits that matter most to investors.</p> <p>With its current PE ratio of 17.6x compared to a Fair Ratio of 22.9x, Harmonic’s stock appears undervalued according to this approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Harmonic Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, approachable tool that lets you create your own story about a company and connect it directly to a set of financial forecasts, such as fair value, future revenue, and margins, based on your own expectations or assumptions.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to review, refine, and share their perspectives, linking Harmonic’s latest business developments or competitive strengths directly to customized valuation models. This makes it easy to decide whether to buy or sell when comparing fair value against the current share price.</p> <p>Narratives stay dynamic, automatically updating when new news emerges, earnings are reported, or company guidance changes, so your investment view never goes out of date.</p> <p>For example, one Harmonic Narrative might reflect a bullish view, projecting a fair value of $12.5 per share based on expanding broadband demand and recurring SaaS revenue. A more cautious Narrative might cite technology risks or customer concentration for a fair value of just $7.0 per share. Narratives let you choose which outlook best fits your beliefs and investment approach.</p> <p>For Harmonic, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Harmonic Narratives:</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/hlit-market-outlook?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Harmonic Bull Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $12.10</p> <p>Current Price is 12% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 5.0%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights Harmonic’s strong positioning in the broadband and video delivery sectors, with Tier-1 telecom partnerships and a low price-to-earnings ratio compared to peers.</li> <li>There are significant tailwinds from broadband expansion, 5G deployment, and recurring SaaS/cloud revenue streams supporting multi-year growth.</li> <li>Cautions on execution risks and reliance on a few large customers, but notes the stock may offer a compelling mix of value and growth for a mid-term investment horizon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/njadqcqc-lifting-industry-headwinds-will-support-broader-demand-and-market-momentum-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Harmonic Bear Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $10.50</p> <p>Current Price is 1.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 0.3%</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes the risks from customer concentration, rapid technology changes, and increased competition, which may pressure revenues and margins.</li> <li>Harmonic’s shift to higher-margin SaaS and cloud products could drive future earnings, but the transition may introduce near-term volatility and execution challenges.</li> <li>Sees the current share price as close to fair value, with modest upside, and suggests investors closely monitor customer trends and industry dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Harmonic? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This move often leads to more investor focus as index-tracking funds rebalance their portfolios to reflect the change.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for George Weston.</a></p> <p>George Weston’s inclusion in the S&amp;P/TSX Preferred Share Index has drawn fresh attention from investors, likely contributing to its momentum this year. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 15.7%, the recent 1-day share price gain of 0.9% hints at renewed optimism after a modest pullback. Over the past five years, the company has delivered a remarkable 183% total return, showing strong long-term value creation even as near-term price swings reflect shifting risk perceptions.</p> <p>If the index move has you wondering what else is on the rise, this is a smart moment to expand your view and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>After a strong run and a fresh boost from its index inclusion, is George Weston still undervalued, or has the market already priced in all the company’s future growth?

With the last close at CA$83.99, investors are paying a premium compared to the broader consumer retailing sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. For a company like George Weston in the consumer retailing space, this metric indicates investor expectations for future profit growth and stability.</p> <p>At 31.6x, George Weston is valued significantly higher than both its North American and peer group averages of 20x. This premium suggests the market is expecting the company to deliver strong earnings growth or stability. However, according to fair value analysis, the justified level would be closer to 23.9x, which implies the current valuation could be considered high if those expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for George Weston</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 31.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower revenue growth or an unexpected dip in net income could quickly change investor sentiment and challenge the current valuation premium.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this George Weston narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Our DCF Model Suggests Upside</h2> <p>While George Weston's current share price looks expensive compared to earnings-based metrics, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

The recent board resolution introducing a progressive dividend policy, a commemorative dividend, a split, and convertible bond amendments clearly signals an intent to reward shareholders and signal long-term stability. However, in the short term, the news follows a period of unusually rapid share price movement, adding another potential catalyst as investors reassess value and reward policies against already high expectations for earnings growth and operational performance. The new capital allocation direction may also shift some risks: while the progressive dividend could boost market confidence, relying on consistent income growth raises the stakes for any earnings hiccups or margin pressure. This makes management’s ability to deliver on ambitious forecasts and navigate industry volatility a more urgent risk than before.\n  \nIn contrast, the newly progressive dividend approach means future earnings misses could create sharper downside reactions, something investors will want to keep in mind.\n</p> IbidenLtd's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 46%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out what it's worth</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-4062/ibidenltd-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/78eccb8d-7037-4f3b-b9a0-fb2a47a90164/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSE:4062 Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community’s fair value estimates for Ibiden range from ¥9,977 to ¥26,830 across two viewpoints, showing a wide spectrum of outlooks.

For CRISPR Therapeutics, this approach uses recent results and analyst estimates for the next several years, then extends those forecasts further into the future to predict long-term financial performance in dollars.</p> <p>Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics reports a Free Cash Flow of about $-330 million. This indicates the company is investing heavily as it ramps up operations. Over the next few years, analysts expect Free Cash Flow to improve significantly, with projections showing the company turning positive by 2029 at $137 million. Projections continue to rise beyond the analyst window, reaching approximately $680 million by 2035, with intermediate milestones marked by significant year-over-year growth as the company scales up.</p> <p>Factoring in these projected cash flows and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $130.87 per share. This is 53.3% above the current share price, which means DCF suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is substantially undervalued at today’s levels.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CRISPR Therapeutics is undervalued by 53.3%.

This multiple measures a company's market value relative to its net assets, offering insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company's book value. For companies at this stage, book value often better reflects the underlying worth and risk profile than earnings-based multiples.</p> <p>Investors typically expect a higher P/B ratio for companies with strong growth prospects or unique assets. On the other hand, higher risk or weak financials can drag the multiple down. As these expectations shift, so does what the market considers a \"fair\" P/B ratio. Currently, CRISPR Therapeutics trades at a P/B ratio of 3.25x. This is higher than the industry average of 2.56x, but lower than the peer average of 11.31x, signaling that the company commands a premium to its industry, but not to its closest peers.</p> <p>The “Fair Ratio” is an advanced benchmark developed by Simply Wall St. It is designed to cut through the noise of simple comparisons to industry or peers. Instead, it factors in not only growth expectations and risk, but also margins, company size, and the specific dynamics of the biotech sector. While we don’t have the exact fair P/B ratio for CRISPR Therapeutics here, this method delivers a much more nuanced view of value. If the fair ratio is very close to the current multiple, that means the stock is trading in line with its fundamentals and risk profile.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/pb-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP PB Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PB ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your CRISPR Therapeutics Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply your own story about a company, connecting why you believe in its future to clear numbers like fair value, expected revenues, and margins.</p> <p>This approach helps you see beyond raw metrics by tying together your view of CRISPR Therapeutics' potential, your forecast, and what you think is a fair price, all in one easy-to-use framework. Narratives are available on Simply Wall St's Community page, where millions of investors share and update their perspectives, making it a powerful and accessible tool for all experience levels.</p> <p>With Narratives, you can make smarter decisions about when to buy or sell. Each Narrative shows the fair value compared to the current price, so you can see at a glance how your view measures up. In addition, Narratives update dynamically every time fresh news or earnings data comes in, keeping your story accurate and actionable.</p> <p>For CRISPR Therapeutics, some Narratives highlight optimism, with fair values well above today's price, while more cautious views reflect lower estimates. This demonstrates how dynamic perspectives can shape investment choices.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for CRISPR Therapeutics? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-crsp/crispr-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/b662408d-9ba7-4c0f-acf0-36bda091061a/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:CRSP Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Together, these factors are viewed as helping to support long-term financial stability.</li> <li>At the same time, the company’s heavy reliance on a few blockbusters and increased regulatory scrutiny creates a situation where strong execution is critical for the margin improvement plan to succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For more on how analysts believe margin improvements could reshape the outlook, explore the full range of consensus perspectives. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/i0z5frmx-aging-demographics-and-genomics-will-drive-healthcare-demand-a6ub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Bristol-Myers Squibb Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Patent Risks and Revenue Concentration Loom</h2> <ul> <li>Upcoming patent cliffs, especially for top sellers such as Eliquis (expected to go generic in 2028) and Opdivo, present a significant risk of generic competition impacting future revenues, which are already projected to decrease by 4.7% per year.</li> <li>The consensus narrative notes these risks are partially offset by a robust late-stage pipeline and high-value partnerships aimed at expanding approvals and indications.\n    <ul> <li>However, any setback in major clinical trials or disappointing launches, particularly for drugs like Cobenfy, would increase Bristol-Myers Squibb’s exposure to declining sales from older products.</li> <li>Analysts are monitoring whether diversification and lifecycle management strategies will be sufficient to counter potentially steep declines from patent expiries.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Versus DCF, But Not Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Although the current share price is $45.62, over 65% below the DCF fair value estimate of $132.29, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s P/E ratio of 18.4x remains a premium to both its peer average (16.5x) and the U.S. Pharmaceuticals industry (18.1x).</li> <li>The analysts' consensus view highlights this tension. Bulls note the apparent deep discount to fair value, but the market’s reluctance to invest at higher levels likely reflects projected declines in key financial metrics and ongoing concerns over reduced pricing power.\n    <ul> <li>To reach the current analyst price target of $53.05, which represents a 16.3% upside from today, analysts anticipate a decrease in the forward P/E multiple over time and improvement in profit margins. Achieving this may prove challenging without clear pipeline successes.</li> <li>Investors may face a value-versus-quality decision, with an appealing entry price tempered by skepticism regarding future growth and profitability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/bristol-myers-squibb-bmy-undervalued-opportunity-or-value-trap-a-deep-dive-into-2024-earnings-and-fair-value\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Bristol-Myers Squibb on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a unique take on the figures?

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\">Kyocera (TSE:6971) has attracted fresh interest after its shares showed strong momentum over the past three months, returning nearly 12%. Recent trading activity has highlighted changing investor sentiment around the company’s valuation.\n<p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Kyocera.</a></p> <p>This comes on the back of a notable year for Kyocera, with momentum picking up as the share price returned nearly 12% over the past three months and a robust 31.7% gain year-to-date. Total shareholder return has also been strong, up 39.6% in the past year and 60.7% over five years. This suggests both short-term and long-term performance has remained impressive amid shifting sentiment and renewed optimism about the company’s growth potential.</p> <p>If you’re watching Kyocera’s rally and wondering what else is gathering steam right now, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With Kyocera’s impressive momentum drawing attention, the real question now is whether the share price still offers upside, or if the market has already factored in the company’s future growth prospects.

With a recent close of ¥2,046.5, this rich valuation signals that the market is pricing in highly optimistic future growth or discounting short-term profit volatility.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio is a widely used metric to gauge how much investors are paying for each unit of earnings. For technology companies like Kyocera, a high P/E can sometimes reflect strong growth expectations or confidence that earnings will rebound sharply after a cyclical dip.</p> <p>However, Kyocera’s P/E of 115.8 is much higher than the Japanese electronic industry average of 15.2 and the peer average of 35.7, highlighting a significant premium that may not be justified by current profitability levels. The fair price-to-earnings ratio is estimated at 27.5, which indicates the current market price reflects much higher expectations than what typical models suggest the company deserves. If sentiment shifts or earnings growth underdelivers, this multiple may revert closer to industry norms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Kyocera</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 115.8 (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, any slowdown in earnings growth or a market correction in tech valuations could quickly challenge the bullish outlook for Kyocera’s shares.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/tech/tse-6971/kyocera-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Kyocera narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Points to Undervaluation</h2> <p>While Kyocera’s share price looks expensive using the price-to-earnings ratio, our DCF model presents a different story.

Before this announcement, Duni was paying out 72% of earnings, but a comparatively small 70% of free cash flows.  In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.   </p><p> Looking forward, earnings per share could rise by 53.0% over the next year if the trend from the last few years continues.   Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 47% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.     </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-durables/sto-duni/duni-shares/dividend\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"historic-dividend\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"988\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/874708-historic-dividend-1-dark-2/1761914103560\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">OM:DUNI Historic Dividend October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/consumer-durables/sto-duni/duni-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Duni </a></span></p> <h2>Dividend Volatility</h2> <p> The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years.      The annual payment during the last 10 years was SEK4.50 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was SEK5.00.      This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.1% over that duration.     Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent.    </p> <h2>The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow</h2> <p> Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future.      We are encouraged to see that Duni has grown earnings per share at 53% per year over the past five years.      However, Duni isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we wonder how quickly it will be able to grow in the future.   </p> <h2>We Really Like Duni's Dividend</h2> <p> Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Duni might even raise payments in the future.       Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash.       Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.   </p><p> It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.  Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

This aligns with the forecasted climb from 7.9% to 10.8%.</li> <li>It is notable that expected margin gains come even as revenue growth projections lag the US market average. This suggests operational upgrades, rather than top-line growth, are driving profitability.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative contends that efficiency efforts will offset moderate revenue growth to boost margins, but the forecasted margin still lags peers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense sector.\n    <ul> <li>While sector averages are not explicitly quoted for future margins, industry comparisons show L3Harris’s current 7.9% margin is lower than some peers. This indicates there is still catch-up potential or risk if targets are missed.</li> <li>With most of the expansion tied to internal projects rather than external demand, achieving the 10.8% margin depends heavily on actual execution of the LHX NeXt cost optimization strategy.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Upbeat earnings forecasts have analysts expecting $2.7 billion in profit by September 2028, but the low end of estimates is just $2.0 billion, signaling ongoing debate around the durability of this growth.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/xtgeqwhm-analyst-upgrades-drive-higher-price-targets-for-l3harris-amid-sector-momentum-and-new-defense-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full L3Harris Technologies Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2>Valuation at a Discount to Industry Peers</h2> <ul> <li>L3Harris trades at a Price-To-Earnings ratio of 32.6x, lower than both the peer median of 75x and the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 38.9x.\n    <ul> <li>This discount is paired with a current share price of $295.90, which stands below the analyst price target of $325.78 and the DCF fair value of $348.93. This could potentially offer upside if consensus estimates hold true.</li> <li>The relatively modest revenue growth expectation of 5.4% per year sets a conservative tone, but forward valuation may look attractive if margin expansion and earnings growth materialize as projected.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Analysts' consensus narrative underscores that despite slower growth and some execution risks, the current valuation reflects both a safety margin against slower uptake and the upside if L3Harris closes the gap to peers.\n    <ul> <li>The market appears to price in the minor financial position risk, but also offers room for reward should efficiency and partnerships pay off.</li> <li>If L3Harris outperforms on margin gains or international demand, the valuation gap to the DCF fair value of $348.93 may shrink further.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Count Set to Decline</h2> <ul> <li>Analysts expect shares outstanding to fall by 1.36% per year over the next three years, signaling capital allocation towards buybacks and potentially delivering higher EPS than topline growth alone would suggest.\n    <ul> <li>The share count reduction augments the forecasted 14.6% per year EPS growth, compounding earnings per share even if overall profit growth trails some sector peers.</li> <li>This aligns with the consensus view that L3Harris will rely on financial management and efficiency, as opposed to just revenue growth, to deliver shareholder value.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that this strategy is not without risk, as sustained buybacks depend on cash generation, and future government budget constraints could challenge both capital returns and overall growth targets.\n    <ul> <li>Reliance on buybacks amplifies the impact of any unexpected earnings shortfalls or cost overruns, raising the bar for operational discipline in the coming years.</li> <li>Continued execution on forecasted reductions in share count is a key component of the analyst valuation case and will be closely watched for delivery.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/xtgeqwhm-analyst-upgrades-drive-higher-price-targets-for-l3harris-amid-sector-momentum-and-new-defense-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for L3Harris Technologies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Interpret the results another way?
