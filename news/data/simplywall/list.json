            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Netskope (NTSK) stock has quietly moved higher over the past week, gaining 7% even as the rest of the market grappled with mixed signals. Investors are looking at how recent financial reports could influence its broader outlook.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Netskope.</a></p> <p>Netskope’s 7-day share price return of 7.4% marks a clear uptick in momentum, helping to erase losses from earlier in the month. While the year-to-date share price return is a positive 4%, this latest rally suggests that investor optimism could be building as sentiment shifts around cybersecurity growth stories like Netskope.</p> <p>If today’s momentum has you curious about what else could be on the move, it’s the perfect chance to discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_tech_and_ai_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/215171/high-growth-tech-and-ai-stocks/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With a share price rally underway and double-digit annual revenue growth, the main question becomes whether Netskope’s current valuation reflects untapped potential or if the market has already priced in the company’s future gains. Is this a real opportunity for buyers, or is investor optimism already factored in?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Sales Ratio of 14.5x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Netskope's current Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.5x, which is significantly higher than both its peers and the broader US Software industry. At a last close of $23.41, this premium valuation raises the question of whether investors are overestimating Netskope's potential compared to rivals.</p> <p>The Price-to-Sales ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current sales. It is often used for high-growth tech companies that may not yet be profitable. For expanding firms like Netskope, a higher multiple can reflect future growth expectations or strong market positioning. However, it may also indicate frothy sentiment if financial fundamentals lag behind those hopes.</p> <p>Specifically, Netskope's 14.5x P/S is almost double the peer group average of 7.5x and almost triple the US Software industry average of 5.4x. This sharp divergence suggests the market is either expecting superior growth or is currently overvaluing the company relative to peers, especially given that Netskope is not yet profitable.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Sales of 14.5x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, ongoing lack of profitability and a high valuation compared to peers could spark a turnaround if revenue growth slows or investor sentiment shifts.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Netskope narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model Puts Valuation Into Question</h2> <p>Taking a different perspective with our SWS DCF model, Netskope appears even more stretched on valuation. The model estimates fair value at $9.83, which is well below today’s $23.41 price. This contrast in methods raises significant questions about how much optimism is built in, and whether growth alone can justify the gap.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.</a></p> <p></p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NTSK Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/393612d3-cb30-4038-8d4d-27eeab7493b4/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NTSK Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Simply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-ntsk/netskope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check out Netskope for example</a>).

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if PulteGroup is currently undervalued or if you’ve missed your shot? You’re not alone, as many investors are buzzing about its long-term potential.</li> <li>The stock price has moved around lately, with a 9.8% gain year-to-date and significant gains over three years. However, a recent dip of 11.2% over the past month suggests some caution may be setting in.</li> <li>Big headlines have focused on the broader housing market’s swing in demand and builder optimism, which have influenced investor sentiment on homebuilders like PulteGroup. With industry fundamentals evolving and mortgage rates causing movement, the news has kept the spotlight on this sector’s resilience and risks.</li> <li>PulteGroup currently scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 out of 6</a> on our most important valuation checks, showing plenty of signs of potential value.

This process helps investors judge what a business is really worth, not just what the market says.</p> <p>For PulteGroup, the DCF model uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The company's Free Cash Flow for the last twelve months came in at $1.56 billion. Over the next decade, analyst estimates and projections show some growth ahead, with Free Cash Flows expected to reach around $2.01 billion in 2027. Simply Wall St extends these forecasts out to 2035, using consensus and extrapolated figures to build a fuller long-term picture.</p> <p>Based on this model, the intrinsic fair value for PulteGroup is calculated at $154.61 per share. This suggests the shares are 23.5% undervalued relative to the current market price, which indicates upside potential for new and existing investors. The model points to a margin of safety, and PulteGroup’s cash generation outlook supports a compelling value case at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests PulteGroup is undervalued by 23.5%.

When companies generate steady profits, the PE ratio offers a direct look at how the market values their underlying earnings power.</p> <p>What counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio typically depends on both growth expectations and perceived risk. Companies with stronger growth prospects, more stable earnings, or lower risk tend to justify higher PE ratios. Businesses facing uncertainty or slower growth are often priced lower on this metric.</p> <p>PulteGroup’s current PE ratio stands at 8.8x, which is meaningfully lower than the Consumer Durables industry average of 10.6x and also below the average for similar peers at 14.1x. On the surface, this could signal that the stock is undervalued compared to the broader sector.</p> <p>To go a step further, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” for PulteGroup at 15.0x. This metric aims to capture more nuance than a simple peer or industry comparison by factoring in the company’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry dynamics, market cap, and unique risk profile. The Fair Ratio helps avoid common pitfalls of benchmarking and puts all the fundamental information into a context tailored for PulteGroup.</p> <p>Comparing the Fair Ratio of 15.0x to the actual PE of 8.8x highlights a significant undervaluation in the shares. It suggests the company is trading at a hefty discount even after considering all relevant risks and growth opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-phm/pultegroup/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/23085cc7-610b-4ade-8e82-b9a624cf7a1f/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PHM PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1386 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your PulteGroup Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let's introduce you to Narratives, an innovative, story-driven approach that connects your perspective on a company, like PulteGroup, directly to its future financial forecasts and your estimated fair value.</p> <p>A Narrative is simply your story for a stock, combining your expectations for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins with your own reasoning and assumptions about the business. Instead of relying solely on formulas, Narratives let you personalize valuation by linking what you believe about PulteGroup’s strategy or market opportunity to concrete financial scenarios.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St's Community page, millions of investors are already using Narratives as an easy and intuitive tool to guide buy or sell decisions. Narratives clearly lay out your fair value, compare it to the current price, and give immediate feedback as to whether you see the stock as undervalued, overvalued, or fairly priced.</p> <p>Importantly, Narratives are dynamic. As soon as news or new earnings arrive, your Narrative updates so your conclusions always reflect the latest information. For example, some investors use a Narrative that emphasizes sustained growth from Sunbelt migration and active adult communities, resulting in a bullish fair value as high as $163.00.

This comes despite long-term value on display in a strong 81.4% three-year total shareholder return. That combination of recent declines and robust multi-year performance suggests that the market is reassessing near-term risks but has not erased confidence in DaVita’s growth potential.</p> <p>If you’re keeping an eye out for more opportunities in healthcare, see the full list of fresh ideas with our curated collection: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_healthcare_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/7008/healthcare-sector/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See the full list for free.</a></p> <p>With DaVita shares trailing recent highs despite solid fundamentals, investors are left weighing whether the current weakness presents a compelling entry point or if the market has already priced in all anticipated growth ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 15.9% Undervalued</h2> <p>DaVita closed at $126.56, but the most followed narrative argues the fair value is $150.50.

This suggests upside to revenue as volumes recover from temporary disruptions. Ongoing investments in technology, AI, and data analytics are driving structural cost reductions through improved operational efficiency and enhanced clinical outcomes. Management expects these measures to support margin improvement even in periods of flat or negative volume growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/426oo7xg-aging-population-and-ai-will-reshape-dialysis-care-yr9j\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Curious what assumptions back this bold price target?

Accelerating adoption of cloud-first strategies among global enterprises is driving migration from on-premise to SaaS, especially highlighted by government and international accounts.

While there were no major headlines driving movement, investors continue to weigh the homebuilder’s recent performance and broader housing sector sentiment.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-kbh/kb-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for KB Home.</a></p> <p>After strong gains earlier in the year, momentum for KB Home has been mixed, with shares up about 13% over the past 90 days but still posting a one-year total shareholder return of -18.7%. This suggests investors are weighing near-term housing headwinds against the company’s longer-term track record. The company continues to maintain multi-year total returns well above the sector norm.</p> <p>If you’re curious where else opportunity might be building, now is a great time to broaden your perspective and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>This raises an important question for investors: Is KB Home currently trading at an attractive valuation given its long-term record, or has the market already factored in all future growth prospects?</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 3% Undervalued</h2> <p>Compared to its recent close at $62.71, the most popular narrative puts KB Home's fair value at $64.67.

The real story is its 15% total shareholder return in the past twelve months and a standout 194% total return over five years. While the recent dip follows downward revisions in sales forecasts and market concerns, the company’s longer-term momentum has rewarded investors who stayed patient through previous challenges.</p> <p>If news-driven shifts like this have you rethinking your investment approach, it might be the right moment to broaden your horizons and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares still up strongly over the past five years and now trading below analyst targets, the question is whether Wacoal has become undervalued after recent weakness or if the market is rightly bracing for tougher times ahead.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x: Is it justified?</h2> <p>Wacoal Holdings currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.2x, which puts it above both the Japanese Luxury industry average and the company’s own long-term fair ratio benchmarks.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings ratio shows what investors are willing to pay today for one yen of the company’s earnings. For an established apparel brand like Wacoal, this multiple can reflect future growth expectations, confidence in brand strength, or skepticism about near-term profit trends.</p> <p>However, Wacoal’s P/E is not just above the industry average of 13.2x; it is also nearly triple its statistically estimated fair value multiple of 5.2x. This premium may signal the market still believes in a turnaround. Compared to similar companies, it suggests shares are expensive on earnings power alone. If market sentiment reverses, the P/E ratio could drift closer to the fair ratio as expectations normalize.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for Wacoal Holdings</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 15.2x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, risks remain if U.S. sales softness deepens further or if Wacoal’s profit margins do not recover as anticipated by the market.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/consumer-durables/tse-3591/wacoal-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Wacoal Holdings narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: SWS DCF Model Challenges the Premium</h2> <p>While market multiples suggest Wacoal is expensive, our DCF model provides a starkly different take.

This further outpaces both the company's own multi-year trend, which saw 8.1% annual earnings growth, and the industry’s average yearly profit expansion.</li> <li>Bullish investors highlight that consistent profit margin improvements, currently at 10%, validate Amrize’s ability to convert revenue into earnings more effectively than sector peers.\n    <ul> <li>Analyst projections for Amrize’s earnings to grow 15.4% per year far exceed the Swiss market average of 10.7% and its industry’s 4% revenue growth trend.</li> <li>This margin progress strongly supports the bullish claim that operational momentum remains intact, even as competitors report more mixed results.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Price Sits Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The recent share price, at CHF42.25, is substantially lower than the calculated DCF fair value of CHF79.02. This reveals a wide valuation gap, even as the stock trades at a 24.8x price-to-earnings ratio above industry norms.</li> <li>This valuation split calls attention to a common dilemma. It supports the prevailing view that the market undervalues long-term profit growth, but also warns that a peer-premium price-to-earnings multiple (24.8x versus industry 15x) could make some investors hesitate, despite the DCF discount.\n    <ul> <li>The prevailing market view sees the deep DCF fair value gap as an opportunity, yet some may be unsettled by the comparatively steep headline multiples.</li> <li>For investors seeking value or growth, the coexistence of sector-premium ratios and a DCF discount creates a push-pull dynamic that shapes buying decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Outlook Pushes Beyond Market and Industry</h2> <ul> <li>Amrize’s forecast annual earnings growth of 15.4% beats both the broader Swiss market (10.7%) and industry peers, giving the company a stronger forward trajectory than many direct competitors.</li> <li>Against this backdrop, the prevailing market view recognizes that while some peers face mixed short-term results, Amrize’s above-average guidance reinforces optimism about future expansion.\n    <ul> <li>The continued gap between Amrize's forecasts and those of its sector could catalyze renewed investor appetite if momentum persists.</li> <li>With no notable risk factors flagged in the latest filings, the narrative of steady profit and revenue increases may keep sentiment biased toward further upside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

While the company’s upbeat earnings and higher dividends helped maintain a supportive narrative, recent months saw the share price soften, with a 3.3% one-month pullback. However, the longer-term story remains remarkably strong. Investors who have held on over the last three or five years still enjoy total shareholder returns of 136% and 234% respectively, even with a -4.7% total return over the past year.

This suggests there could be some meaningful upside. The rationale for this estimate centers on expectations for lasting industry transformation and operational improvements that may drive the company’s next phase of growth.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Anticipated acceleration in demand for industrial and specialty gases linked to the global shift to clean fuels and hydrogen is likely to benefit Nippon Sanso.

The company's dedication to superior service and disciplined yield management supports long-term market share gains and operational density improvements, which could enhance operating leverage and improve earnings.”\n</p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/099pxlb0-capacity-investments-and-expense-management-will-secure-future-market-share-55ar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p> Want to know the real financial engine behind this bullish estimate?
