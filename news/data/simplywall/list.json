The new US$0.625 dividend and ex dividend date do not materially alter that core thesis. In the very near term, the key catalyst is the upcoming Q4 2025 earnings release, while the biggest risk remains a sharp correction in charter rates if trade routes normalize or demand softens.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement to this dividend is the declared timetable for Q4 2025 results on March 5, 2026, which now lands just one day before the payout date. That puts the dividend, capital return story, and fresh earnings data right next to each other on the calendar, potentially sharpening investor focus on how effectively Global Ship Lease is turning its contracted backlog and recent fleet additions into sustainable free cash flow and ongoing shareholder distributions.</p> <p>But against this backdrop, investors should also be aware of the risk that tighter environmental rules could force costly upgrades or early scrapping of older ships...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/transportation/nyse-gsl/global-ship-lease/foinmbvw-midsize-container-ships-will-improve-efficiency-despite-market-headwinds-fx8t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Global Ship Lease (it's free!)</a></p><p>Global Ship Lease's narrative projects $621.0 million revenue and $270.6 million earnings by 2028.

Analysts have provided forecasts that feed into a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, with Simply Wall St extending the projections further out. Within that framework, projected Free Cash Flow for 2035 is $1,014.98 million, based on a mix of analyst inputs and extrapolated estimates.</p> <p>When all those forecast cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of around $812.41 per share. Versus a recent share price near $597, this suggests the stock is trading at roughly a 26.5% discount to that DCF estimate. On this cash flow based approach, the model result indicates that CACI may be undervalued.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests CACI International is undervalued by 26.5%.

It reflects both what the market thinks of those earnings today and how it is weighing the risks around them.</p> <p>Higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk usually support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tend to pull a “normal” or “fair” P/E lower. CACI International currently trades on a P/E of about 25.4x. That sits above the Professional Services industry average of roughly 20.6x, but below the peer group average of around 28.0x.</p> <p>Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for CACI is 27.2x, which is its proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E might be given the company’s earnings characteristics, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This can be more tailored than a simple peer or industry comparison, because it adjusts for factors that can differ meaningfully between companies. With the current P/E of 25.4x sitting modestly below the Fair Ratio of 27.2x, the multiple suggests the stock may be undervalued on this basis.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-caci/caci-international/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/1429557d-de3e-47fa-b954-56434f5f9dd9/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CACI P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

The sharp earnings rebound and higher 2025 output help underpin confidence in near term cash generation, yet the key swing factor remains timing, cost, and regulatory clarity around Çöpler, which this latest update does not meaningfully resolve.</p> <p>The newly announced US$300 million share repurchase program is the most relevant piece of news here, because it sits alongside 2026 production guidance of 450,000 to 535,000 gold equivalent ounces and relatively high AISC, especially once Çöpler care and maintenance is included. For investors, that pairing puts a brighter spotlight on the trade off between returning cash today and preserving balance sheet flexibility if Çöpler remediation costs or regulatory delays turn out to be more onerous than currently expected.</p> <p>Yet, even with higher earnings and buybacks, investors should be aware that Çöpler’s unresolved regulatory path and rising reclamation estimates could still...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/materials/tsx-ssrm/ssr-mining-shares/fnivcwfn-ssrm-higher-gold-price-forecasts-will-spark-continued-share-momentum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on SSR Mining (it's free!)</a></p><p>SSR Mining's narrative projects $2.3 billion revenue and $792.9 million earnings by 2028.

Check out what every dividend investor needs to know in our dividend analysis.</a></p> <p>The 11% increase in Range Resources’ quarterly dividend to US$0.10 per share, or US$0.40 annualized, comes right after a year where the company reported higher revenue and net income for 2025 and generated over US$650m in free cash flow. For you as a shareholder, the timing matters because management is pairing the dividend move with a larger buyback authorization and a 10 year gas sales contract to a Midwest power plant, which together point to confidence in future cash generation and demand visibility. The contract ties a slice of production to a single large customer, which can smooth volumes compared with fully spot exposure.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Range Resources Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The long term power-plant contract supports the narrative that regional demand from power and data center loads can underpin Range Resources’ Marcellus-focused gas strategy.</li> <li>The step up in shareholder returns, including the dividend increase and expanded repurchase program, could test the narrative if capital needs for drilling and processing expansions turn out higher than expected.</li> <li>The specific 10 year offtake agreement to a Midwest power plant, and its contract terms, are not fully captured in the broader narrative around LNG exports and data center demand.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/0cxwm1v1-rrc-medium-term-demand-from-lng-exports-and-datacenters-will-drive-upside\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Range Resources</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ A larger recurring cash dividend reduces flexibility if future drilling or processing costs rise faster than expected.</li> <li>⚠️ Concentration in Appalachia and reliance on power and LNG-linked demand leave Range Resources exposed if regional prices or regulatory conditions become less favorable.</li> <li>🎁 A higher dividend combined with a US$1.5b buyback capacity signals that recent free cash flow levels have given the board confidence in returning capital.</li> <li>🎁 The 10 year gas supply agreement offers long term volume visibility that many peers such as EQT and Chesapeake Energy may not have to the same contract-specific extent.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch how the new dividend compares with free cash flow over the next few quarters, especially as Range Resources spends US$650m to US$700m on its 2026 capital program.

Earnings for the past year have been reported as growing 24.2%. The company has seen quarterly revenue move from US$145.0 million in Q3 2024 to US$165.9 million in Q4 2024, then to US$162.2 million, US$184.8 million, US$198.9 million and finally US$213.6 million through FY 2025. Over the same stretch, basic EPS stepped through US$0.17, US$0.24, US$0.38, US$0.37 and US$0.37 to US$0.36, setting up an earnings season where investors are weighing steady profitability against how durable those margins really are.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Vital Farms.</a> <p>With the headline numbers on the table, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up with the widely shared narratives around Vital Farms’ growth drivers, risks and profit quality.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about Vital Farms</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/324f69bb-f700-4940-9dc6-82d2a62f5e2c/chart/revenue-and-expenses-breakdown?date=2026-02-27\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGM:VITL Revenue &amp; Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h2>24.2% earnings growth with margins holding around 8.7%</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, Vital Farms generated trailing twelve month net income of US$66.3 million on US$759.4 million of revenue. This works out to an 8.7% net margin compared with 8.8% in the prior year and ties in with the 24.2% earnings growth figure.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights strong brand and pricing power as key supports for earnings, and the current figures partly back that up while also setting some limits:\n    <ul> <li>The 24.2% earnings growth and US$1.49 trailing EPS line up with the idea that Vital Farms has been able to charge premium prices without losing volume. However, the net margin edge of 8.7% versus 8.8% a year earlier shows that profitability is not racing ahead of sales.</li> <li>Consensus points to expanded production and better distribution as drivers for profit. The move from US$576.1 million to US$759.4 million in trailing revenue over the reported periods suggests the company is putting that extra capacity to use, even if margins have stayed roughly flat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Investors who want to see how these margin trends fit into both the bullish and cautious takes on Vital Farms can check the stories other investors are building around the same numbers in more depth: <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGM/VITL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Vital Farms.</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation gap: 14.9x P/E and DCF fair value</h2> <ul> <li>On the valuation side, Vital Farms is trading on a trailing P/E of 14.9x, which is below both the 60.5x peer average and the 24.5x US Food industry average. The stock price of US$21.09 also sits well under a DCF fair value figure of about US$476.21.</li> <li>Bullish investors argue that this gap between price and fundamentals points to upside, and the current numbers give that view some clear support with a few caveats:\n    <ul> <li>The combination of a 14.9x P/E and 24.2% earnings growth is the kind of setup bulls point to when they say the market may not be fully reflecting growth yet, especially when trailing EPS sits at about US$1.49.</li> <li>At the same time, analysts' price targets in the dataset are capped at US$42.00, which is far below the US$476.21 DCF fair value figure. This means even the optimistic views around the stock are spread across a very wide valuation range.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth forecasts meet high non cash earnings risk</h2> <ul> <li>Looking ahead using the provided figures, analysts expect earnings to grow about 17.05% per year and revenue about 18.3% per year. Current trailing margins sit at 8.7% and reported earnings include a high level of non cash items flagged as an earnings quality risk.</li> <li>Bears focus on that earnings quality concern and rising spending, and the current figures give them material points to work with as a counter to the growth story:\n    <ul> <li>Critics point out that a high proportion of non cash earnings can make profit growth look stronger than cash generation. Even though trailing net income is US$66.3 million, not all of that may reflect underlying cash flow strength.</li> <li>Bears also highlight that heavier capital spending and higher marketing and overhead costs could weigh on future cash generation, which matters if the forecast 17.05% earnings growth and 18.3% revenue growth do not show up in the actual reported numbers to the extent analysts expect.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Vital Farms on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>With a mix of clear upside arguments and some real question marks, it is worth looking at the data yourself rather than relying on headlines.

These moves indicate that sentiment around the name has been shifting quickly.</p> <p>Regulatory action of this kind can influence how a platform shapes age checks, data usage, and product decisions. As Reddit appeals, you may want to monitor how the company updates its policies, communicates with users, and manages any follow up from other regulators, since those responses could affect its risk profile and brand over time.</p> <p>Stay updated on the most important news stories for <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-rddt/reddit/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a> by adding it to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"news_stay_updated_cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a>.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters who focus on the recent turnaround can point to Q2 to Q4 basic EPS between roughly US$1.01 and US$2.19 as evidence that profitability has held above early 2024 levels in recent quarters.</li> <li>The longer term decline in earnings growth rate, despite the strong trailing 12 month print, shows the bullish story is relying heavily on the latest year rather than a multi year pattern.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Strong recent profits sit next to a weaker multi year track record, and that tension is exactly what many investors are trying to weigh up right now. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/INVA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the what the Community is saying about Innoviva.</strong></a></p> <h2>One off gain inflates 65.9% margin</h2> <ul> <li>The reported 65.9% trailing net profit margin is much higher than the 6.5% margin a year earlier, and the data attributes a US$161.6 million one off gain as a key factor, so a large slice of the margin is tied to a single item rather than repeatable operations.</li> <li>Critics highlight that the very large year over year earnings improvement, described as more than a tenfold jump, is hard to treat as a new normal when:\n    <ul> <li>The one off gain of US$161.6 million fed directly into the trailing 12 month net income of US$271.2 million, which means a material portion of that profit is non recurring.</li> <li>The same data set shows analysts expecting earnings to decline by about 0.8% per year over the next three years, so the bearish view is that the spike in margins does not line up with the more muted outlook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>“Cheap” 6.5x P/E versus 19.9x industry</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of US$23.54, the trailing P/E of 6.5x sits well below both the reported US Pharmaceuticals industry average of 19.9x and a peer average of 17.7x, while the DCF fair value cited for Innoviva is US$53.96, which is much higher than the current price.</li> <li>What is interesting for the more cautious, bearish narrative is that this discount exists alongside softer longer term earnings trends and forecasts:\n    <ul> <li>Earnings across the last five years declined at about 22.1% per year, even though the most recent trailing 12 month period shows very strong profit, so the low P/E is being judged on a high earnings base that includes a large one off gain.</li> <li>Revenue is forecast to grow at 9.5% per year, slightly below the 10.4% reference rate for the US market, which bears use to argue that the apparent valuation gap may be partly explained by more modest growth expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how other investors are weighing that low 6.5x P/E against the earnings record and forecasts, the community discussion is a helpful next step. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?

However, the 90-day share price return shows a 5.09% decline, which contrasts with a 1-year total shareholder return of 142.68%.

Yet the market is assigning a premium that suggests investors are heavily focused on future growth potential and the aPAP opportunity rather than today’s financials.</p> <p>That premium also stands out against peers. Savara’s 15.6x P/B is described as expensive versus both the US Biotechs industry average of 2.7x and a peer average of 12.1x, implying the market is paying a significantly richer multiple than is typical for the space.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-book of 15.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, you still have to weigh the risk that the company remains loss making, with net income of $115.645m in the red and no current revenue base.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Savara narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>With sentiment clearly split between the risks and the potential upside, it makes sense to act now and review the numbers for yourself, starting with <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-svra/savara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 1 important warning sign</a>.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If you are serious about sharpening your watchlist, do not stop at one stock story, use the Simply Wall St screener to uncover ideas you might otherwise miss.</p> <ul> <li>Spot potential value opportunities early by scanning companies on our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">54 high quality undervalued stocks</a> list that pair quality fundamentals with prices that may not fully reflect them.</li> <li>Strengthen your defensive side by reviewing companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_low_risk\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473631/low-risk-leaders/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80 resilient stocks with low risk scores</a> that score well on stability and downside protection.</li> <li>Get ahead of the crowd by checking the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undiscovered_gems\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473622/high-quality-undiscovered-gems/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">screener containing 24 high quality undiscovered gems</a> where strong fundamentals have yet to attract broad attention.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That 28.3% earnings growth compares to a 5 year compound rate of 3.3%.</li> <li>Bulls argue that this kind of earnings acceleration supports a stronger long term story, yet the data creates a mixed picture:\n    <ul> <li>The 28.3% trailing earnings growth and higher 2.5% margin line up with the bullish view that better efficiency and mix can support higher profitability over time.</li> <li>At the same time, consensus and bullish scenarios are still only assuming earnings growth in the low to mid single digits each year, which is much closer to the older 3.3% 5 year trend than to the most recent year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over the past year, that gap between the one year surge and the slower 5 year pace is exactly what bullish investors are debating in their forecasts for Ahold Delhaize, and it is unpacked further in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/nzlb4xbk-demographic-shifts-and-digital-expansion-will-create-lasting-value-sdn5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bull Case</strong></a>. <h2>Steady quarterly EPS with same store sales around 3%</h2> <ul> <li>Across FY 2025, quarterly EPS stayed in a tight band between €0.60 and €0.65 while reported same store sales growth was 3.3% in Q1, 4.0% in Q2, 2.9% in Q3 and 3.2% on a trailing twelve month basis.</li> <li>Bears point out that this kind of mid single digit same store sales and stable EPS ties in with their concern about limited top line momentum:\n    <ul> <li>Forecasts for revenue growth of about 2.3% a year and earnings growth of about 4.4% a year are not far from what this same store sales range suggests and are slower than the Dutch market forecasts of 9.6% for revenue and 12.4% for earnings.</li> <li>This helps the bearish side argue that even with stable quarterly EPS today, future growth may be constrained by mature markets and rising competition in areas like online grocery and discount formats.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptical investors who see those growth forecasts as a ceiling rather than a floor are building their case around this slower profile, and you can see that laid out clearly in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/89uf5o5x-digital-competition-will-erode-market-share-and-raise-costs-6h5d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize Bear Case</strong></a>. <h2>Valuation gap and slower growth vs Dutch market</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a P/E of 16.4x versus a peer average of 28.1x and an industry average of 18.8x.
