However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 4.6%.    </p> <p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434423/us-midstream-oil-and-gas-pipeline-operators/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.</a></p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2> Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last Year </h2> <p> In fact, the recent sale by Non-Executive Director Alan Steele was not their only sale of Mayfield Group Holdings shares this year.  Earlier in the year, they fetched AU$1.36 per share in a -AU$2.7m sale.     That means that even when the share price was below the current price of AU$1.95, an insider wanted to cash in some shares.  We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable.  Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price.   We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Alan Steele's holding.    </p> <p> Alan Steele divested 2.49m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of AU$1.44.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership.   Mayfield Group Holdings insiders own 64% of the company, currently worth about AU$122m based on the recent share price.  Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.  </p><h2> So What Do The Mayfield Group Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate? </h2><p> An insider hasn't  bought Mayfield Group Holdings stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.     Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying.    On the plus side, Mayfield Group Holdings makes money, and is growing profits.    It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.      In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Mayfield Group Holdings.

Net profit margin dropped to 11.7% from last year’s 13.7%, and the bottom line was boosted by a one-off CA$290.0 million gain. Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow at 4.1% per year, trailing the Canadian market’s 5%, while earnings are expected to accelerate by 21.3% per year, pacing well ahead of the sector. Investors are weighing this strong growth outlook against a premium 27x P/E ratio as well as notable risks around financial quality, share dilution, and dividend sustainability.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-cpx/capital-power-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Capital Power.</a> <p>Next up, we’ll see how the headline figures fit alongside the current narratives.

This year's result was propped up by a one-time gain of CA$290.0 million, indicating that reported profitability may not reflect underlying trends.</li> <li>According to the analysts' consensus view, recurring earnings growth could be constrained going forward if non-operating gains fade and profit margins continue to shrink.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes margins could decline further to 12.8% within three years, which points to pressure from rising costs and competitive dynamics.</li> <li>Forecasts show annual profit could fall from CA$614.0 million today to CA$521.7 million by July 2028 if operational challenges persist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Share Dilution and Lower Quality Earnings Raise Red Flags</h2> <ul> <li>The number of shares outstanding is expected to rise by 7.0% per year over the next three years, reducing the benefit of any per-share earnings growth.</li> <li>Consensus narrative highlights that increasing share count and reliance on one-off income gains weaken earnings quality and can limit upside for shareholders.\n    <ul> <li>Rising dilution makes it harder for true underlying EPS to keep up with headline growth rates, which poses a headwind for long-term value creation.</li> <li>The trend of one-time boosts requires scrutiny, as bulls counting on sustainable earnings may be overstating operational momentum.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Premium Valuation Despite Price Below DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>At a 27x P/E, Capital Power trades above both its peer average (21x) and the global renewables industry (17.2x). Its CA$70.21 share price sits at a steep discount to DCF fair value of CA$210.32.</li> <li>Consensus narrative flags that a premium multiple is only justified if robust growth and margin assumptions play out, while analyst price target of CA$75.96 offers only modest upside.\n    <ul> <li>The narrow 6.7% gap between current price and target suggests analysts see fair pricing. Expectations are high, and any disappointment on growth or margins could weigh on the shares.</li> <li>Investors may want to examine whether guided earnings growth and margin forecasts are truly achievable in light of competitive and market risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you want to see how the broader consensus narrative stacks up against these latest financial figures, check out the full story in the analyst consensus breakdown. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Capital Power Consensus Narrative.</strong></a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/88qktb3y-analysts-raise-targets-for-capital-power-on-improved-margins-and-strong-growth-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Capital Power on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Do these figures tell a different story to you?

The recently announced joint project with Samsung SDI and BMW is a clear positive for Solid Power’s product validation efforts, potentially accelerating its timeline toward market entry, however, the short-term financial impact and mitigation of its concentration risk are still uncertain.\n</p> <p> Of all recent announcements, the expanded partnership with SK On (expected to generate at least US$50 million in revenue) stands out as a potentially relevant catalyst. This agreement, combined with the Samsung SDI and BMW collaboration, highlights increasing industry traction even as Solid Power faces ongoing cash burn and high capital requirements that could pressure its liquidity if losses persist.\n</p> <p> By contrast, investors should be aware that reliance on a handful of major partners remains a key risk if expectations around commercial adoption or ongoing commitments do not fully materialize...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/automobiles/nasdaq-sldp/solid-power/v38tuaov-sldp-future-gains-will-be-constrained-by-prolonged-overvaluation-risks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Solid Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>Solid Power's narrative projects $33.2 million in revenue and $1.6 million in earnings by 2028.

Revenue is forecast to decline by 4.7% per year over the next three years, while EPS is expected to grow at a rate of 5.53% annually.

This perspective is underlined by concerns over rising capital requirements and the pace of Equinor’s renewables expansion.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus notes that while Equinor’s low multiple offers immediate value, it may also reflect caution about the sustainability of high dividends as legacy oil and gas fields mature.</li> <li>The consensus also points out that persistent optimism assumes offshore wind and renewables will offset margin pressures.

Ongoing profit growth and new long-term gas contracts could add upside.\n    <ul> <li>Consensus highlights that the fair value premium is only meaningful if projected margin improvements and cash flows from new projects materialize amid regulatory and price risks.</li> <li>This wide discount, combined with moderate analyst price targets near current levels, shows how the market is balancing potential upside with caution about decarbonization and energy transition headwinds.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/h6km0ill-lower-cash-returns-and-sector-downgrades-will-pressure-oil-and-gas-margins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Equinor on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Have a different interpretation of the data?

The recent profit guidance cut points directly to these regions as ongoing short-term challenges, putting pressure on the main recovery catalyst while spotlighting market risks that may continue to weigh on revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future.\n</p> <p> One recent announcement relevant to these ongoing risks was the reduction in dividend payments set in July 2025, which reflects management’s response to lower profit expectations and the need to conserve cash. This aligns with cautious measures aimed at protecting the company’s financial stability during a period of weak demand in China and the U.S., reinforcing the importance of prudent cash and risk management as operating conditions shift.\n</p> <p> However, with competitive pricing and slowed Cognac market recovery in the U.S., investors should be aware that...\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fr/food-beverage-tobacco/epa-rco/remy-cointreau-shares/5q6fz44w-rco-expanding-us-and-china-investments-will-support-business-recovery-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Rémy Cointreau (it's free!)</a></p><p>Rémy Cointreau's outlook anticipates €1.1 billion in revenue and €146.2 million in earnings by 2028.

If realized, this would mark a dramatic recovery from current lows.</li> <li> According to analysts' consensus view, several trends drive this optimism: \n    <ul> <li>Digital sales are increasing, with web sales up 8.4% in Q2, alongside new investments in omnichannel and digital marketing efficiency.</li> <li>Supply chain shifts to reduce China exposure and grow partnerships in Vietnam are meant to boost gross margins and stabilize profit, highlighting a proactive approach to future disruptions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Discount Despite Growth Forecasts</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of $21.65, Haverty trades well below both its DCF fair value of $60.94 and the consensus analyst target of $29.00. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2x is a deep discount to peer averages at 34.9x.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus narrative emphasizes this rare combination:\n    <ul> <li>Storm clouds from weak housing and macro headwinds have not derailed a forecast of 7.2% annual revenue growth or the expectation for earnings to climb from $19.6 million to $107.4 million by 2028, showing potential for long-term upside.</li> <li>Sustained focus on brand loyalty and deeper market penetration in the southern U.S. is expected to drive long-term demand, while a discount to DCF fair value and peer multiples provides an added margin of safety for new investors entering at today’s price.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Even analysts who take a wait-and-see approach acknowledge the substantial gap between the current price and projected value, suggesting plenty of room for sentiment to shift if the fundamentals play out as forecast. <strong>📈 Read the full Haverty Furniture Companies Consensus Narrative.</strong></p> <h2>Dividend and Cost Pressures Remain Manageable</h2> <ul> <li>Despite some flagged risks around dividend sustainability and higher SG&amp;A costs, no major risks were highlighted, and there is no evidence of significant recent insider selling.</li> <li> Analysts' consensus view highlights that persistent cost pressures, such as rising advertising and occupancy costs, are in focus. However, operational improvements via supply chain diversification and expanding store footprint are expected to offset much of this, with only minor risk to the company’s ability to deliver forecasted earnings growth.\n    <ul> <li>The company's plan to grow physical presence in high-potential southern U.S. markets aims to leverage fixed costs and capture market share, potentially enhancing long-term earnings durability.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/ns9p7qtj-us-housing-trends-will-fuel-omnichannel-and-supply-chain-shifts-wl7v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Haverty Furniture Companies on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Looking at the data from a fresh angle?

The latest guidance for Q4, featuring substantially reduced EBITDA estimates and a clear acknowledgment of ongoing softness in demand, has put the spotlight on Olin’s ability to deliver tangible margin improvements, while the main short-term catalyst remains successful execution on cost reduction, and the biggest risk continues to be a prolonged global oversupply and weak pricing environment in chlor-alkali and vinyls. The recent update does not materially change these fundamental drivers, but elevates scrutiny of operational execution through what management warns is seasonally the weakest quarter.</p> <p>Among the latest company actions, Olin announced the repurchase of 500,000 shares for US$10.1 million during the third quarter, finalizing just over 21% of the buyback program launched in mid-2022. This ongoing share repurchase effort is important as it signals confidence in capital return even as near-term earnings headwinds remain a concern for investors tracking progress on both catalysts and risks.</p> <p>Yet unlike the market’s initial focus on low EDC prices, investors should also be aware of the risks posed by ongoing high inventories and weak demand in the Winchester ammunition segment...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/materials/nyse-oln/olin/9ns8vr59-analyst-commentary-reflects-cautious-optimism-as-olin-faces-mixed-signals-and-modest-valuation-gains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Olin (it's free!)</a></p><p>Olin's outlook anticipates $7.4 billion in revenue and $375.3 million in earnings by 2028.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Statistically speaking, long term investing is a profitable endeavour.  But no-one is immune from buying too high.  For example, after five long years the <strong>Lendlease Group</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASX:LLC</a>) share price is a whole 57% lower.  That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least.     </p><p> After losing 3.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.   </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.</a></p> <p> While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance.  By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. </p> <p> Lendlease Group became profitable within the last five years.    That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down.   Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. </p><p> The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower.   The revenue decline of around 2.9% would not have helped the stock price.  So it seems weak revenue and dividend trends may have influenced the share price.      </p><p> The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"earnings-and-revenue-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1048\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/722005-earnings-and-revenue-growth-1-dark-2/1761943343470\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ASX:LLC Earnings and Revenue Growth October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><p> We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off.  It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.  In the case of Lendlease Group, it has a TSR of -52% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.  This is largely a result of its dividend payments! </p> <h2>A Different Perspective</h2><p> Lendlease Group shareholders are down 14% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%.  Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested.     Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 9% over the last half decade.  Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.        While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.   Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/real-estate-management-and-development/asx-llc/lendlease-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for Lendlease Group </strong> </a> (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.    </p><p> Lendlease Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Redeia Corporación (BME:RED) is forecasting earnings growth of 5.23% per year and expects revenue to rise 4.8% annually, which is ahead of the broader Spanish market's 4.2% growth outlook. Despite these positive projections, the company's net profit margin has slipped from 33.6% to 30%, and reported earnings have decreased at a rate of 5.5% per year over the last five years. Although the stock is trading at a premium, with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio of 16.6x that surpasses both its peers (14.9x) and the industry average (13.3x), the current share price of €15.61 also remains above the estimated fair value of €13.75.

These factors help counter the recent drop in net profit margin.</li> <li>New regulatory incentives and higher projected EBITDA indicate that long-term investments could help stabilize or lift profitability, even as capital expenditure ramps up.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Rising Capital Investment, Rising Risks</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia plans average annual capital expenditures of at least €1.5 billion through 2028, well above previous levels and industry norms, with major projects reinforcing the Spanish power network and interconnections.</li> <li> The consensus narrative notes that these heavy investments grow the regulated asset base and strengthen future revenue streams, yet bring notable risk:\n    <ul> <li>Operational and financial stress is cited as a risk. Ambitious spending could overload balance sheet leverage and pressure free cash flow if subsidies or disposals do not materialize as planned.</li> <li>S&amp;P's placement of Redeia on negative CreditWatch underscores the concern that costly upgrades and regulatory uncertainty may elevate credit risk and funding costs over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Stays Stretched Versus Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Redeia's current share price (€15.61) sits well above the DCF fair value estimate of €13.75 and implies a PE ratio of 16.6x, higher than both its peer group (14.9x) and the European Electric Utilities sector (13.3x).</li> <li> Analysts’ consensus view underscores the persistent premium. To match the long-term analyst price target of €17.86, investors must believe in sustained robust growth and margin recovery.\n    <ul> <li>The requirement for Redeia to trade at 19.5x PE on 2028 earnings shows the valuation is already baking in meaningful upside. This may leave little margin for error if growth or regulation disappoints.</li> <li>This premium reflects optimism about investment-led gains but creates valuation sensitivity if margin improvements or capital returns lag expectations.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Analyst forecasts and fundamental trends show Redeia's profile is defined by the balancing act between ambitious, capex-driven growth and the risks of cost overruns, margin pressure, and valuation stretch.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_consensus_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>📊 Read the full Redeia Corporación Consensus Narrative.</strong></a> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/cmmt8kp0-eu-energy-transition-and-grid-modernization-will-secure-reliable-infrastructure-ai3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Redeia Corporación on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/portfolio/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Want to interpret the data through your own lens?

While ENTRA1 Energy’s potential US$25 billion funding under the US-Japan Framework boosts overall sector confidence, the most important short-term catalyst, securing firm customer deployment and contracts, remains directly tied to NuScale’s project execution, and the core risk of delays in commercialization is largely unchanged by this announcement.\n</p> <p> Among NuScale’s recent announcements, the September 2025 agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of SMR capacity is most relevant. It directly reinforces the scale of customer commitment underpinning the substantial capital now potentially available through ENTRA1, highlighting the importance of NuScale’s ability to turn partnership momentum into tangible revenue-generating projects.\n</p> <p> However, investors should also be aware that the complexity of securing long-term customer agreements remains a fundamental source of risk, and without these…\n</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/capital-goods/nyse-smr/nuscale-power/64bqs928-analysts-weigh-nuscale-power-valuation-amid-smr-milestones-and-revised-price-targets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on NuScale Power (it's free!)</a></p><p>NuScale Power is projected to reach $402.3 million in revenue and $42.2 million in earnings by 2028.
