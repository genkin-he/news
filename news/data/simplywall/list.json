Over the past five years, the company’s earnings have declined at an average annual rate of 8.8%. The stock trades at $11.07, giving it a Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 70.7x, which is well above the peer average of 12x and the US Banks industry average of 11x. Its share price remains higher than the estimated fair value of $8.97.

This method gives a sense of what the stock should be worth based on its future earnings potential, not just its current profits.</p> <p>For Harmonic, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $119.2 Million, highlighting a healthy level of cash generation. According to analyst estimates and model extrapolation, free cash flow in 2026 is projected to be $69.7 Million, with a decline over the next decade to around $35 Million by 2035. While analysts typically offer cash flow projections only a few years out, the model extends these estimates to provide a longer-term view.</p> <p>Based on these projections, Harmonic’s intrinsic value is calculated as $5.15 per share. With the current share price at more than double this figure, the DCF model indicates the stock is about 107% overvalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Harmonic may be overvalued by 107.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 839 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Harmonic.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Harmonic Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies like Harmonic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used methods for stock valuation. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, making it a practical gauge of market sentiment and perceived potential.</p> <p>Typically, a company with strong growth prospects or lower risk will command a higher PE ratio, while those facing uncertainty warrant a lower multiple. Factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends all play crucial roles in shaping what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE for a particular business.</p> <p>At present, Harmonic trades at a PE ratio of 17.6x. This is significantly below both the peer average of 28.9x and the communications industry average of 33.5x. This suggests the market is pricing in more caution or slower growth for Harmonic. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio model, which uniquely considers the company’s growth forecasts, profit margins, risks, industry, and market cap, calculates Harmonic’s fair PE at 22.9x. Unlike simply comparing to peers or industry, the Fair Ratio fine-tunes expectations to the individual company traits that matter most to investors.</p> <p>With its current PE ratio of 17.6x compared to a Fair Ratio of 22.9x, Harmonic’s stock appears undervalued according to this approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Harmonic Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, approachable tool that lets you create your own story about a company and connect it directly to a set of financial forecasts, such as fair value, future revenue, and margins, based on your own expectations or assumptions.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to review, refine, and share their perspectives, linking Harmonic’s latest business developments or competitive strengths directly to customized valuation models. This makes it easy to decide whether to buy or sell when comparing fair value against the current share price.</p> <p>Narratives stay dynamic, automatically updating when new news emerges, earnings are reported, or company guidance changes, so your investment view never goes out of date.</p> <p>For example, one Harmonic Narrative might reflect a bullish view, projecting a fair value of $12.5 per share based on expanding broadband demand and recurring SaaS revenue. A more cautious Narrative might cite technology risks or customer concentration for a fair value of just $7.0 per share. Narratives let you choose which outlook best fits your beliefs and investment approach.</p> <p>For Harmonic, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Harmonic Narratives:</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/hlit-market-outlook?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Harmonic Bull Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $12.10</p> <p>Current Price is 12% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 5.0%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights Harmonic’s strong positioning in the broadband and video delivery sectors, with Tier-1 telecom partnerships and a low price-to-earnings ratio compared to peers.</li> <li>There are significant tailwinds from broadband expansion, 5G deployment, and recurring SaaS/cloud revenue streams supporting multi-year growth.</li> <li>Cautions on execution risks and reliance on a few large customers, but notes the stock may offer a compelling mix of value and growth for a mid-term investment horizon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/njadqcqc-lifting-industry-headwinds-will-support-broader-demand-and-market-momentum-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Harmonic Bear Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $10.50</p> <p>Current Price is 1.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 0.3%</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes the risks from customer concentration, rapid technology changes, and increased competition, which may pressure revenues and margins.</li> <li>Harmonic’s shift to higher-margin SaaS and cloud products could drive future earnings, but the transition may introduce near-term volatility and execution challenges.</li> <li>Sees the current share price as close to fair value, with modest upside, and suggests investors closely monitor customer trends and industry dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Harmonic? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This move often leads to more investor focus as index-tracking funds rebalance their portfolios to reflect the change.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for George Weston.</a></p> <p>George Weston’s inclusion in the S&amp;P/TSX Preferred Share Index has drawn fresh attention from investors, likely contributing to its momentum this year. While the 1-year total shareholder return stands at an impressive 15.7%, the recent 1-day share price gain of 0.9% hints at renewed optimism after a modest pullback. Over the past five years, the company has delivered a remarkable 183% total return, showing strong long-term value creation even as near-term price swings reflect shifting risk perceptions.</p> <p>If the index move has you wondering what else is on the rise, this is a smart moment to expand your view and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>After a strong run and a fresh boost from its index inclusion, is George Weston still undervalued, or has the market already priced in all the company’s future growth?

With the last close at CA$83.99, investors are paying a premium compared to the broader consumer retailing sector.</p> <p>The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio shows how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. For a company like George Weston in the consumer retailing space, this metric indicates investor expectations for future profit growth and stability.</p> <p>At 31.6x, George Weston is valued significantly higher than both its North American and peer group averages of 20x. This premium suggests the market is expecting the company to deliver strong earnings growth or stability. However, according to fair value analysis, the justified level would be closer to 23.9x, which implies the current valuation could be considered high if those expectations are not met.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"fair_ratio_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the SWS fair ratio for George Weston</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price-to-Earnings of 31.6x (OVERVALUED)</strong></p> <p>However, slower revenue growth or an unexpected dip in net income could quickly change investor sentiment and challenge the current valuation premium.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-retailing/tsx-wn/george-weston-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this George Weston narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: Our DCF Model Suggests Upside</h2> <p>While George Weston's current share price looks expensive compared to earnings-based metrics, our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> There's been a notable change in appetite for <strong>Sats ASA</strong> (<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OB:SATS</a>) shares in the week since its third-quarter report, with the stock down 11% to kr36.30.       Revenues were in line with forecasts, at kr1.3b, although statutory earnings per share came in 16% below what the analysts expected, at kr0.48 per share.     This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business.  With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. </p><p class=\"link-injector\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"investing-ideas\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/434616/us-dividend-powerhouses-with-a-forecast-yield-of-6percent/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year.

This reflects a decent 11% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months.       Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 51% to kr3.23.        In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of kr5.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of kr3.13 in 2026.        The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.    </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Sats </a></span></p> <p> The consensus price target rose 5.5% to kr44.67, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well.        The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is.   The most optimistic Sats analyst has a price target of kr48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at kr43.00.   Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.    </p> <p> Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/no/consumer-discretionary/hospitality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>. We would highlight that Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2026 being well below the historical 11% p.a. growth over the last five years.    By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.6% annually.  So it's pretty clear that, while Sats' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.     </p><div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p> The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Sats following these results.        Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry.       There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  </p><p> Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.   At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Sats going out to 2027, and you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/no/consumer-services/ob-sats/sats-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see them free on our platform here.</a>. </p><p> Don't forget that there may still be risks.

While it's always nice to have higher profit, a large contribution from unusual items sometimes dampens our enthusiasm.  We ran the numbers on most publicly listed companies worldwide, and it's very common for unusual items to be once-off in nature.  And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies.   We can see that Holmen's positive unusual items were quite significant relative to its profit in the year to September 2025.  All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit a poor guide to underlying earnings power.   </p><p> That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability.  Luckily, you can <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here to see an interactive graph</a> depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.  </p> <h2>Our Take On Holmen's Profit Performance</h2><p> As previously mentioned, Holmen's large boost from unusual items won't be there indefinitely, so its statutory earnings are probably a poor guide to its underlying profitability.      For this reason, we think that Holmen's statutory profits may be a bad guide to its underlying earnings power, and might give investors an overly positive impression of the company.    And we are pleased to note that EPS is at least heading in the right direction in the alst twelve months.     At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly.    In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.    While conducting our analysis, we found that Holmen has <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/materials/sto-holm-b/holmen-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs</strong></a> and it would be unwise to ignore them.  </p><p> This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Holmen's profit.   But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.  For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.  While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this <strong>free</strong> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/16053/high-return-on-equity-low-debt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> collection of companies boasting high return on equity</a>, or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion-grid\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> this list of stocks with significant insider holdings</a> to be useful.  </p></div>",
