Using data, analytics and AI-powered tools in the supply chain and marketing could help Colgate-Palmolive respond more quickly to consumer trends and retailer demands, including in e-commerce channels where competitors like Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and Nestlé are active.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The Colgate-Palmolive Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The plan to expand omnichannel reach and use digital tools is consistent with the narrative that positions emerging markets and premium oral care as long term growth drivers supported by better data and targeted marketing.</li> <li>Execution risk on restructuring and productivity programs could challenge the idea that cost savings will always be easy to reinvest while still supporting margins, especially if category growth in key markets is slower than analysts expect.</li> <li>The emphasis on AI and predictive analytics in the supply chain is an area that may not be fully captured in older narratives that focused more on product and geographic expansion than on back end efficiency gains.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/a7tksu28-cl-future-cost-optimization-will-drive-competitive-advantage-amid-category-headwinds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for Colgate-Palmolive</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Colgate-Palmolive is committing to multi year productivity and restructuring efforts, and if these projects disrupt operations or fall short on savings, the payoff from the 2030 plan could be limited.</li> <li>⚠️ The company faces category pressures and private label competition in several regions, so heavier digital and AI investment may not fully offset weaker volumes or pricing pressure in oral care and pet nutrition.</li> <li>🎁 Colgate-Palmolive has strong global brands and exposure to emerging markets, and the 2030 plan aims to use science led product development and data driven marketing to support that position across oral care, personal care, home care and pet nutrition.</li> <li>🎁 Analysts have identified rewards such as forecast earnings growth, a reliable dividend and a valuation that some models view as below estimated fair value, which frame how this long term plan might appeal to different investor profiles.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, you may want to watch for concrete milestones on the 2030 plan, such as evidence of supply chain savings, new product launches backed by scientific claims and traction in e-commerce and omnichannel partnerships. Commentary around Hill’s Pet Nutrition and emerging markets like Latin America and India will also matter, given their role in previous analyst views of Colgate-Palmolive’s growth mix. Finally, pay attention to how management talks about reinvesting productivity gains into advertising and R&amp;D, and whether that shows up in brand share trends relative to peers such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Colgate-Palmolive, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/CL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Colgate-Palmolive</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

That mix of signals is what many investors are trying to interpret alongside the recent share price swings.</p> <p>P/B compares the company’s market value to the book value of its net assets. This can be a useful anchor for a business like Disc Medicine that is still in the clinical stage and unprofitable. With no revenue, forecast losses over the next three years, and a reported net loss of $212.18m, the market is effectively paying a multiple of the company’s balance sheet, pipeline and intellectual property rather than current earnings.</p> <p>On one hand, the 3.4x P/B is below the peer average of 5.2x, which suggests the company is priced lower than some direct comparables. On the other hand, it is above the wider US biotech industry average of 2.7x, which indicates investors are still assigning a premium to Disc Medicine relative to the sector overall, despite the company being unprofitable and forecast to have no revenue next year. There is also a large gap between the current share price of $66.62 and both the analyst price target of $99.36 and the SWS DCF model estimate of $369.15. The market could move closer to or further from those levels as new clinical data, funding developments or insider activity, including the recent significant insider selling, come through.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iron/disc-medicine/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p><strong>Result: Price to Book ratio of 3.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</strong></p> <p>However, there are still clear pressure points here, including a clinical stage pipeline with no current revenue and a recent net loss of $212.18m that could influence sentiment.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-iron/disc-medicine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Disc Medicine narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another view: DCF points to a very different price</h2> <p>That 3.4x P/B might look roughly in line with the story so far, but our DCF model paints a very different picture. At a share price of $66.62 versus an estimated future cash flow value of $369.15, the model suggests Disc Medicine could be trading at a steep discount.

The latest 4.1% dividend increase supports this income-focused thesis but does not materially change the key short term catalyst, which is execution on its capital investment program, or the main risk around regulatory and policy outcomes across its jurisdictions.</p> <p>Among recent announcements, the 2025 full year results, with higher sales and net income versus 2024, are most relevant to this dividend news. They show that Fortis’s growing regulated asset base is still converting into higher earnings, which supports the current dividend level and the company’s emphasis on stable, regulated returns as a core part of its investment story.</p> <p>Yet beneath this long dividend streak, investors still need to be aware of rising debt costs and regulatory pushback that could...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/ca/utilities/tsx-fts/fortis-shares/nykvhb33-analysts-lift-fortis-price-target-amid-positive-profit-margin-outlook-and-key-developments\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Fortis (it's free!)</a></p><p>Fortis' narrative projects CA$13.8 billion revenue and CA$2.1 billion earnings by 2028.

It is often used for early stage or loss making businesses where earnings are not yet meaningful. For a clinical stage biotech with no revenue and ongoing losses, a higher P/B can reflect how investors are weighing the company’s pipeline, expected future cash flows, and funding needs against its current balance sheet.</p> <p>Here, Cogent’s 11.4x P/B is described as good value relative to its peer average of 19.1x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock at a discount to similar names focused on comparable areas. At the same time, the same 11.4x is described as expensive versus the wider US biotechs industry average of 2.7x, meaning investors are currently assigning a much richer valuation than they are to the sector overall.</p> <p>Result: Price-to-Book of 11.4x (ABOUT RIGHT)</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"alternate_preferred_multiple_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.</a></p> <p>However, you also have to weigh the pipeline and valuation against clinical trial uncertainty and the ongoing net loss of US$328.937 million with no current revenue.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Cogent Biosciences narrative.</a></p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>If you are weighing the mix of strong past returns and a significant net loss, take a moment to review the key data and form your own view, including the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_risks_rewards_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-cogt/cogent-biosciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1 key reward and 3 important warning signs</a> that highlights what the market currently sees on both the risk and reward side.</p> <h2>Looking for more investment ideas?</h2> <p>If Cogent has you thinking more broadly about your portfolio, do not stop here, there are other stocks and themes worth putting on your radar right now.</p> <ul> <li>Target potential mispricings by scanning companies that look attractively valued on key fundamentals using our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_undervalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473076/high-quality-undervalued-stocks/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">46 high quality undervalued stocks</a> before the crowd turns its attention to them.</li> <li>Strengthen your income stream by reviewing companies with higher yields and resilient payouts through the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_dividend\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473528/dividend-fortresses/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">15 dividend fortresses</a> so you are not relying on capital gains alone.</li> <li>Prioritise resilience by focusing on businesses with robust finances and consistent metrics via the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_screener_solid_balance_sheet\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10146/solid-balance-sheet-and-fundamentals/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">solid balance sheet and fundamentals stocks screener (39 results)</a>, rather than leaving your capital tied to weaker balance sheets.</li> </ul> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $2.78b. Analyst and extrapolated estimates suggest free cash flow reaching around $3.70b by 2030, with a path that moves through projected figures such as $2.81b in 2026 and $3.46b in 2029, all in US dollars.</p> <p>After discounting these projected cash flows, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $462.30 per share. Compared with the current share price of around $307, this implies a 33.6% discount, which indicates that the shares screen as undervalued under this particular set of assumptions.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Public Storage is undervalued by 33.6%.

It captures both what the business is earning today and how the market is weighing its prospects and risks.</p> <p>In general, higher growth expectations and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk usually line up with a lower, more cautious multiple. The question is not whether a P/E is high or low in isolation, but whether it makes sense given the company’s profile.</p> <p>Public Storage currently trades on a P/E of 33.99x. That sits above the Specialized REITs industry average of 15.86x, and below the peer group average of 41.55x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Public Storage is 34.36x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given the company’s earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and key risks. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it tries to account for the specific mix of growth, risk and profitability that is unique to Public Storage.</p> <p>With the current P/E of 33.99x very close to the Fair Ratio of 34.36x, the shares screen as ABOUT RIGHT on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Narratives let you turn your view of Public Storage into a clear story that links its business outlook to a financial forecast, then to a fair value, all inside Simply Wall St’s Community page where millions of investors share their assumptions. You can compare a more upbeat view that leans toward the higher US$350 price target with a more cautious view closer to US$287, see how each Narrative’s fair value stacks up against today’s share price, and watch those fair values update automatically as new earnings, guidance or news come through. This can give you a practical framework to decide whether the current price lines up with your own expectations.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Public Storage? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/NYSE/PSA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-psa/public-storage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/bfbc8a79-e724-403f-9cd8-11f09d230631/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-28\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:PSA 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The upgraded FY26 profit and ARR guidance reinforces that storyline and likely strengthens the near term catalyst around recurring revenue growth. At the same time, it does not remove the key risk that expectations embedded in the current valuation could still prove demanding if growth slows.</p> <p>Among the recent announcements, the upgraded FY26 guidance is the most directly relevant. Lifting profit before tax growth expectations to 18% to 20% and ARR growth to 16% to 18% gives more concrete shape to the SaaS+ thesis that many investors are watching closely. Combined with continuing board refreshment and Philip Davis’ initial on market share purchase, it supports a narrative of management leaning into the recurring revenue opportunity while the market reassesses shorter term share price weakness.</p> <p>But against this stronger guidance, investors should still weigh the risk that Technology One’s premium valuation could come under pressure if revenue growth in key markets were to...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/au/software/asx-tne/technology-one-shares/nfnd5wy8-overvaluation-will-encounter-regulatory-headwinds-and-saas-resilience-hxrs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Technology One (it's free!)</a></p><p>Technology One’s narrative projects A$841.0 million revenue and A$224.2 million earnings by 2028.

The 2025 10-K reinforces that story: management is leaning into a diversified deposit base, higher-yielding securities and a thicker capital cushion, with CET1 at 14.10% and shareholders’ equity up 14.4%. That is reassuring given recent volatility in bank funding costs, and it supports the near-term dividend story after the latest increase to US$0.24 per share. At the same time, the filing also puts a spotlight on the weak revenue growth, a 3.1% net interest margin and a greater tilt toward variable-rate loans, which keeps interest rate risk, funding competition and the stock’s above-peer valuation firmly on the list of near-term swing factors.</p> However, investors should not ignore how interest rate sensitivity could pressure margins if conditions shift.\n\nDespite retreating, First Bancorp's shares might still be trading 41% above their fair value. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the potential downside here</a>.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nasdaq-fbnc/first-bancorp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/18aaef02-f6ad-4640-bf94-5195b7c7866f/chart/quote-price\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>FBNC 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p>Three fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$54 to almost US$97 per share, underlining how far apart individual views can be.
