While revenue is forecast to grow by 2.1% per year, trailing the broader US market's 10.2% pace, earnings are expected to rise sharply at 44.86% per year. This points to a possible return to profitability within three years. Major risks include BXP's less-than-robust financial position. However, investors may find appeal in its attractive dividend, a favorable price-to-sales ratio relative to peers, and forecasts for above-average profit growth.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for BXP.</a> <p>Next, we will see how these earnings figures compare with the most widely held market narratives and whether the numbers reinforce or challenge the current story.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_range_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/p9cdwcmx-gateway-office-demand-and-disposition-plans-will-shape-performance-ahead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See what the community is saying about BXP</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-bxp/bxp/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/66909603-076c-4562-bb5f-8014d41ea084/chart/earnings-and-revenue-history\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:BXP Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Margin Expansion Forecast: Analysts See Net Margin Rising From 0.1% to 10%</h2> <ul> <li>Profit margins are projected to rise sharply over the next three years, from a negligible 0.1% today to 10% by 2028, as BXP targets a transition back to sustained profitability.</li> <li>Analysts‚Äô consensus view expects margin growth will be driven by:\n    <ul> <li>A ‚Äúflight to quality‚Äù trend is leading to higher occupancy rates and premium rents for BXP‚Äôs centrally located, modern assets.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Wondering if Costco stock is still worth your hard-earned cash, or if it‚Äôs gotten too pricey? Let‚Äôs dive in together and see what the numbers really say.</li> <li>Despite some choppiness lately, with shares down 3.4% over the past week and a small dip of 0.5% across the last month, Costco has delivered a 4.3% gain for the year and a remarkable 96.3% return over the past three years.</li> <li>This month, headlines focused on Costco‚Äôs new store openings and bold expansion plans. These moves reinforce its reputation for consistent growth. The excitement around its international push and updated membership offerings has investors debating whether recent price moves reflect new opportunities or fresh risks.</li> <li>Costco currently lands a valuation score of <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">0 out of 6</a>. By several standard checks, this suggests it may be fully valued or even pricey right now. Let‚Äôs break down exactly how we arrive at that score in the next section and, even more importantly, look at what makes for a smarter way to judge value that goes beyond traditional methods.</li> </ul> <p>Costco Wholesale scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks.

In simple terms, it answers the question, \"What is all the future cash flow worth in today‚Äôs dollars?\"</p> <p>For Costco Wholesale, the latest reported Free Cash Flow is $8.16 billion, reflecting strong generation of cash by its underlying business. Analyst forecasts extend out over the next five years, starting at $7.75 billion in 2026 and rising to $12.25 billion by 2030. After this, Simply Wall St extrapolates further annual growth by considering recent business trends and industry expectations. They estimate Free Cash Flow will continue rising through the next decade.</p> <p>Using these projections, the DCF model calculates Costco‚Äôs intrinsic value at $686.26 per share. When compared to the company‚Äôs current price, this valuation implies the stock is trading at a 33.0% premium to its intrinsic value. In other words, while Costco remains a robust and growing business, the DCF approach suggests the current market price is higher than what future cash flows justify.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Costco Wholesale may be overvalued by 33.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 848 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>COST Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Costco Wholesale.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Costco Wholesale Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Costco Wholesale, as it relates a company‚Äôs share price to its actual earnings. Investors often use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of a company‚Äôs earnings. This makes it particularly relevant for established, consistently profitable businesses.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that what counts as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúfair‚Äù PE ratio depends on both growth expectations and risk. Companies with higher expected earnings growth or lower risk profiles typically command higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher risk pushes the ratio down. As a result, simply comparing PE ratios across different companies does not always give the full picture.</p> <p>Currently, Costco Wholesale is trading at a PE ratio of 49.9x. This stands well above the average PE for its direct peers at 22.0x and the broader Consumer Retailing industry‚Äôs average of 20.4x. On the surface, you might think this implies Costco‚Äôs stock is too expensive compared to other retailers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St‚Äôs ‚ÄúFair Ratio‚Äù offers a more comprehensive benchmark. The Fair Ratio calculates what Costco‚Äôs PE should be by specifically considering its actual earnings growth, industry profile, profit margins, market capitalization, and risk level. In summary, it takes the bigger picture into account. In Costco‚Äôs case, the Fair Ratio is 29.4x, which is much higher than industry and peer averages but still well below Costco‚Äôs current PE.</p> <p>When we compare these numbers, Costco‚Äôs current PE is significantly above its Fair Ratio. This means that, even after considering Costco‚Äôs growth, margins, and market-leading position, the stock appears to be overvalued on this measure.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1382 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Costco Wholesale Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier, we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a story you create about a company, connecting your perspective on its business drivers‚Äîsuch as store expansion, international growth, online sales, and risks‚Äîto your own forecast for revenue, profits, and fair value.</p> <p>Narratives let you move past just numbers by linking a company‚Äôs real-world story to a financial outlook and ultimately to what you think is a fair price. On Simply Wall St‚Äôs Community page, millions of investors easily build and update Narratives around companies like Costco, quickly aligning their views with dynamic forecasts and new information as it arrives.</p> <p>Using Narratives, investors can make smarter buy or sell decisions by comparing their Fair Value calculations to the current share price, and adjusting instantly as earnings or news emerge. For example, some investors have a bullish Narrative on Costco, predicting rapid international expansion and strong e-commerce growth, setting their fair value at $1,225 per share. Others are more cautious, citing higher costs and competitive pressures to justify a fair value as low as $620.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Costco Wholesale? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/ede69fea-1fbf-45f9-a1a7-cb2a2e60f847/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:COST Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

This suggests investors are weighing near-term housing headwinds against the company‚Äôs longer-term track record.

At the last close of A$1.76, investors are paying a significant premium compared to similar Australian Metals and Mining stocks.</p> <p>The price-to-book ratio compares a company‚Äôs market price to the value of its net assets. This makes it a widely used benchmark in the capital-heavy mining sector. For an unprofitable company like FireFly Metals, a higher ratio could reflect optimistic hopes for future discoveries and development, but it also raises the bar for project delivery.</p> <p>FireFly‚Äôs elevated multiple stands out from its industry peers. The average for comparable companies is 2.2x, so this valuation signals that the market is already factoring in significant upside for the Green Bay project.

Momentum has faded recently as investors digest the company‚Äôs growth story and consider whether risk perception around the stock is beginning to shift.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre looking to spot the next breakout, now is a great moment to expand your investing universe and discover <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_fast_growing_high_insider_ownership_screener\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fast growing stocks with high insider ownership</a></p> <p>With shares down and fundamentals still showing double-digit growth, investors are left wondering if this dip signals a genuine undervaluation or if the market has already factored in all of Vital Farms‚Äô future prospects.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h2>Most Popular Narrative: 33.7% Undervalued</h2> <p>Vital Farms' most-followed narrative suggests there is a sizeable gap between its consensus fair value and the recent close price. With the consensus fair value at $52.60 and a last close of $34.89, the stock is viewed as deeply discounted by the narrative‚Äôs proponents. This sets the stage for a look at the factors fueling that call.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Significant expansion of farm and production network, including acceleration of CapEx to build out capacity (two production lines at the Seymour, Indiana facility and additional cold storage), positions Vital Farms to fully capitalize on unmet/pent-up demand. This would remove prior supply constraints and unlock further revenue and earnings growth.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_narrative_prompt_after_quote\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete narrative.</a></p> <p>Can expansion alone propel Vital Farms to the narrative's ambitious targets? The real twist is in the underlying expectations for outpaced earnings growth, margin leverage, and a premium multiple rarely seen outside high-growth sectors. Uncover which bold assumptions push this price target so far above consensus and what it would take for the fair value case to actually play out.</p> <p><strong>Result: Fair Value of $52.60 (UNDERVALUED)</strong></p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_ai_narrative\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/px9chu5h-seymour-expansion-and-ethical-food-demand-will-unlock-value-75kd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.</a></p> <p>However, heavy capital spending or disappointing demand growth could pressure margins and profits, which could quickly challenge the optimistic valuation narrative for Vital Farms.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"risks_narrative_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nasdaq-vitl/vital-farms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out about the key risks to this Vital Farms narrative.</a></p> <h2>Another View: The Market‚Äôs Multiple</h2> <p>Taking a look at valuation through the lens of the price-to-earnings ratio tells a different story. Vital Farms trades at 30.2x earnings, which is above both the US Food industry average of 18.5x and its peer average of 30.7x. Notably, this is also higher than the fair ratio of 23.3x that the market could move toward. This suggests some valuation risk, despite strong fundamentals.

The company‚Äôs net profit margin has edged down to 3.8% from last year‚Äôs 3.9%, and over the past five years, earnings have declined at an annual rate of 8.2%, with negative earnings growth most recently reported.

This demonstrates resilience as the broader specialty retail sector faces ongoing cost headwinds.</li> <li>Investor commentary highlights Komeri‚Äôs reliable operations and steady cash flows even as industry competition intensifies.\n    <ul> <li>The steady margin performance positions Komeri as a lower-risk, defensive choice. This is especially valued when sector peers have reported steeper margin compression amid inflation.</li> <li>While margin stability is seen as a strength, the modest 0.1 percentage point decline indicates that securing future profitability will depend on ongoing operational improvements, not just defensive positioning.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>DCF Discount Signals Underlying Value Debate</h2> <ul> <li>Shares trade at ¬•3,200, a 59% premium to the DCF fair value estimate of ¬•2,007.03. The company‚Äôs P/E of 10.8x is attractively below peers and industry averages.</li> <li>Prevailing analysis points out that while Komeri looks undervalued on earnings compared to competitors, the significant DCF premium raises debate over whether the share price already reflects all its defensive advantages.\n    <ul> <li>This valuation tension spotlights Komeri‚Äôs appeal as a ‚Äúgood value‚Äù pick for relative P/E shoppers, but leaves room for debate on whether the broader market is overlooking risks tied to lagging growth rates and past earnings declines.</li> <li>Investors weighing value versus growth must reconcile the company‚Äôs below-peer P/E and defensive cash generation with the gap to intrinsic value implied by discounted cash flows.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Five-Year Earnings Slide Raises Bar for Improvement</h2> <ul> <li>Earnings have declined by an annual rate of 8.2% over the last five years, and the latest period also saw negative growth. This extends a multi-year pattern of underperformance compared to market averages.</li> <li>Despite commendable cost management, broader market observers caution that continued declines amplify the importance of management executing on digital upgrades and margin stabilization.\n    <ul> <li>Some see Komeri‚Äôs steady dividend and focus on operational improvements as important, but argue that these have yet to reverse the entrenched earnings downtrend that positions the company as a ‚Äúreliable but slow‚Äù performer compared to more dynamic peers.</li> <li>With revenue and earnings growth forecasts still trailing the Japanese market, calls for bold execution are growing louder among investors who want evidence that management can deliver a meaningful turnaround.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

The overall impact of the recent news on these factors appears material for near-term profitability and international momentum.</p> <p>One recent announcement that stands out is the launch of the Blue Tab collection, aiming to reinforce Levi's product diversity by appealing both to premium shoppers and value seekers. This move aligns closely with international growth catalysts, particularly if tariff relief improves supply chain flexibility and supports global demand for core denim offerings.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p> Fresnillo (LON:FRES) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 61% over the last three months.   We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes.      In this article, we decided to focus on <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"intro\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fresnillo's </a> ROE.   </p><p> Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital.

That means that for every ¬£1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated ¬£0.14 in profit. </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Fresnillo </a></span></p> <h2> What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? </h2><p> We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings.  Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company‚Äôs earnings growth potential.  Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. </p><h2> Fresnillo's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE  </h2><p> To start with, Fresnillo's ROE looks acceptable.   Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%.   However, while Fresnillo has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 10.0% .  We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth.  Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.    </p><p> So, as a next step, we compared Fresnillo's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 8.2% over the last few years.   </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"past-earnings-growth\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/44543451-past-earnings-growth-1-dark-2/1761827352628\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">LSE:FRES Past Earnings Growth October 30th 2025</figcaption></figure><p> Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.   What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price.  By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await.    One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/gb/materials/lse-fres/fresnillo-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check if Fresnillo is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.   </p><h2> Is Fresnillo Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits? </h2> <p> Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 49% (where it is retaining 51% of its profits), Fresnillo has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above.  It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.   </p> <p> Additionally, Fresnillo has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.      Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 48%.   Still, forecasts suggest that Fresnillo's future ROE will rise to 29% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.    </p> <h2> Summary  </h2> <p> In total, it does look like Fresnillo has some positive aspects to its business.      Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business.       With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Kathwari Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> Our data indicates that Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. has a market capitalization of US$717m, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$3.8m for the year to June 2025.   We note that's an increase of 19% above last year.    We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.2m.  </p><p> For comparison, other companies in the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/consumer-discretionary/consumer-durables\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Consumer Durables industry</a> with market capitalizations ranging between US$400m and US$1.6b had a median total CEO compensation of US$6.3m.    In other words, Ethan Allen Interiors pays its CEO lower than the industry median.    What's more, M. Kathwari holds US$45m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2025</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2025)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$1.2m</td><td align=\"right\">US$1.2m</td><td align=\"center\">30%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$2.7m</td><td align=\"right\">US$2.1m</td><td align=\"center\">70%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">US$3.8m </td><td align=\"right\">US$3.2m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Speaking on an industry level, nearly 19% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 81% is other remuneration.

The latest Phase 2 MaGic trial data, reviewed at major medical meetings, offered tangible clinical improvements and suggested flexible dosing advantages which could impact the perception of pipeline risk and timeline to late-stage studies. While revenue remains negligible and losses have widened, having fresh, data-driven momentum can serve as a key short-term catalyst, supporting the company‚Äôs efforts to build confidence among investors and potential partners. However, faced with a lack of profitability forecasts for the next three years, shareholder dilution after sizable recent equity offerings, and challenging valuation metrics compared to peers, execution on commercial and clinical fronts remains the biggest test. The new clinical results may help reduce perceived risk around the lead asset, but do not address the company‚Äôs dependence on further capital and trial success.\n<br/><br/> On the other hand, the risk of further dilution as Dianthus remains unprofitable is something investors should weigh.\n</p> In light of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our recent valuation report</a>, it seems possible that Dianthus Therapeutics is trading beyond its estimated value.<h2>Exploring Other Perspectives</h2><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-dnth/dianthus-therapeutics/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/cec42e6d-5fe2-4d4f-9f00-2f8ce03d80eb/chart/earnings-and-revenue-growth\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>DNTH Earnings &amp; Revenue Growth as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> The Simply Wall St Community has posted a single consensus fair value estimate of US$62.13 per share, suggesting strong conviction among private investors.
