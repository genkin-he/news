As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 6th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum.    However, some shareholders may still want to keep CEO compensation within reason.     </p><p><span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings </a></span></p><h2> How Does Total Compensation For Yoram Naveh Compare With Other Companies In The Industry? </h2><p> According to our data, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has a market capitalization of ₪15b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth ₪3.3m over the year to December 2024.   That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation.    It is worth noting that the CEO compensation consists entirely of the salary, worth ₪3.3m.  </p><p> On comparing similar companies from the <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"industry\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/il/financials/insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Insurance industry</a> with market caps ranging from ₪6.5b to ₪21b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was ₪2.1m.    Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. pays Yoram Naveh north of the industry median.  </p><table><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2024</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>2023</strong></td><td align=\"right\"><strong>Proportion (2024)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other</strong></td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"right\">-</td><td align=\"center\">-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Compensation</strong></td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m </td><td align=\"right\">₪3.3m</td><td align=\"center\">100%</td></tr></table><p> Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 86% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 14% of the pie.    Speaking on a company level, Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings prefers to tread along a traditional path, disbursing all compensation through a salary.    If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.  </p><figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ceo-compensation\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"1016\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/asset/chart/883047-ceo-compensation-1-dark-2/1761885980464\" width=\"1642\"/></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">TASE:CLIS CEO Compensation October 31st 2025</figcaption></figure><h2> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd.'s Growth </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 6.9% a year over the past three years.     Its revenue is up 54% over the last year.   </p><p> It's great to see that revenue growth is strong.  With that in mind, the modestly improving EPS seems positive.  So while we'd stop short of saying growth is absolutely outstanding, there are definitely some clear positives!      We don't have analyst forecasts, but you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/il/insurance/tase-clis/clal-insurance-enterprises-holdings-shares/past\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this more detailed historical graph</a> of earnings, revenue and cash flow.  </p> <h2>Has Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. Been A Good Investment?</h2><p> Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd. for providing a total return of 219% over three years.  This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.  </p> <h2> In Summary... </h2><p> Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings pays CEO compensation exclusively through a salary, with non-salary compensation completely ignored.       Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM.     Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.      </p><p> While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business.

This approach helps investors gauge whether a stock's market price reflects its potential to generate cash over time.\n</p> <p> For Coterra Energy, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow stands at $1.50 Billion. Analysts provide detailed cash flow forecasts out to 2029, with projected Free Cash Flow rising to $2.60 Billion by that year. Over the full 10-year model horizon, which includes both analyst forecasts and methodical extrapolations, the company’s cash flows remain strong and show healthy growth. The pace moderates in later years as projections move beyond analyst coverage and rely on broader industry assumptions.\n</p> <p> According to this DCF model, Coterra’s intrinsic value is estimated at $65.90 per share. This implies the stock is trading at a 64.5% discount to its calculated fair value, suggesting that it is significantly undervalued based on projected future cash generation.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Coterra Energy is undervalued by 64.5%.

It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. Since earnings influence long-term shareholder returns, the PE ratio is especially useful for comparing companies within the same industry or across the broader market.\n</p> <p> A company's fair PE ratio depends on more than just profits. Growth expectations play a significant role; faster-growing companies often command higher multiples, while uncertainties or heightened risk can result in lower valuations. Stable profit margins and larger market capitalizations also tend to increase what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE.\n</p> <p> Coterra Energy is currently trading on an 11.33x PE multiple. This is below the Oil and Gas industry average of 12.59x and also comfortably under the peer group average of 16.72x. To provide a fuller picture, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" for each company that blends key factors such as expected earnings growth, industry trends, company size, profit margins, and risk. For Coterra, the Fair Ratio is 18.33x, indicating the stock is valued well below what would be expected given its underlying fundamentals.\n</p> <p> By using the Fair Ratio, investors gain a more tailored sense of value rather than relying solely on industry or peer averages. This approach adjusts for the nuances that make Coterra unique, capturing both upside growth and risk factors in a way that broad benchmarks cannot.\n</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/energy/nyse-ctra/coterra-energy/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/7bd04a4e-2eae-48ba-a4a4-24f8bbac094b/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:CTRA PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Coterra Energy Narrative</h3> <p> Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a practical way for investors to tie together their view of a company's story, like Coterra's growth drivers or risks, with their forecasts for future revenue, earnings, and profit margins. This approach ultimately helps determine what they believe to be a fair value for the stock.\n</p> <p> Narratives connect the dots between \"what's happening at the company\" and \"what the numbers mean,\" allowing you to set your own assumptions and see the financial impact. On the Simply Wall St platform, Narratives are easy for anyone to create or follow within the Community page, empowering millions of users to document their perspectives and update them as news or earnings releases come in.\n</p> <p> With Narratives, you can quickly see if your Fair Value signals a buy, hold, or sell opportunity compared to today's Price.

Despite that recent surge, the five-year average shows a yearly decline of 11.1% in earnings, setting a backdrop of longer-term caution.

The quality of earnings was viewed as high relative to recent sector results and supports Landmark Bancorp’s reputation for reliability.</li> <li>Reliability of earnings and capital discipline are heavily cited by prevailing market narratives as supporting the case for Landmark as a stable, defensive pick.\n    <ul> <li>Consistent margin outperformance and a prudent management approach are highlighted as reasons investors seeking stability may be drawn in, despite the backdrop of declining long-term profits.</li> <li>The narrative also points out that Landmark typically trades at a valuation premium over weaker banks due to these safety and quality attributes. The company’s recent margin rebound offers fresh justification for that stance.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Dividend and Value Appeal Versus Sector Peers</h2> <ul> <li>Landmark Bancorp’s price-to-earnings ratio stands at 9.2x, which is lower than both the US Banks industry average (11x) and its direct peer group (10x). The current share price of $25.92 trades below the DCF fair value of $28.10.</li> <li>The prevailing market view notes Landmark’s attractive valuation and steady dividend payout as key investor rewards.\n    <ul> <li>Being priced at a discount to sector peers is positioning the stock as a value opportunity. However, expectations for outsized returns remain modest because long-term growth trends have been negative.</li> <li>Prevailing sentiment points to the reliable dividend and relative safety as the main draw, even as the upside potential may be capped absent a material change to the earnings trajectory.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Concerns Linger Despite Recent Gains</h2> <ul> <li>While earnings surged 44.3% year-on-year, the five-year average reflects an annual earnings decline of 11.1%, underscoring that improvement is set against a much weaker long-term trend.</li> <li>Prevailing market analysis points to caution, as recent strength in earnings and margins may not be enough to reverse several years of steady declines.\n    <ul> <li>Investors and analysts remain watchful, since the lack of current forecasts for future growth means the jury is still out on whether the positive momentum is sustainable.</li> <li>This tension between near-term outperformance and longer-term weakness tempers expectations that the strong results are the start of a durable turnaround.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

While net profit margin has fallen to 5.1% from last year’s 18.5%, the company has achieved a significant 23% annual earnings growth over the past five years. Revenue growth is expected to be more modest at 5.2% per year compared to the broader US market at 10.3%. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.7x, below both industry peers and sector averages, with shares changing hands below an indicated fair value estimate.

            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><p>Japan Exchange Group (TSE:8697) reported net profit margins of 36.9% this year, down from 38.3% the previous year. Over the past twelve months, earnings grew by 2.7%, trailing the company’s five-year average annual growth rate of 5.3%. Looking forward, earnings and revenue growth are both expected to remain slower than the broader Japanese market averages. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 28x indicates a valuation premium over peers. With net profits trending upward but at a modest pace, and valuation factors coming into focus, investors may find the landscape nuanced as earnings season unfolds.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/diversified-financials/tse-8697/japan-exchange-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Japan Exchange Group.</a> <p>Now that we have the headline numbers, let’s see how they match up with the key narratives investors are watching this season.

This signals that while profitability remains strong, margins are trending lower compared to the prior period.</li> <li>Bulls highlight how the company’s reputation for high earnings quality secures its place among leading global exchanges. However, the softening margin adds nuance:\n    <ul> <li>Momentum in modernizing trading infrastructure and consistent revenue from high trading volumes are positives frequently cited by optimistic investors.</li> <li>Still, the downward margin trend suggests JPX may not capture the same scale of upside as peers if sector growth accelerates further this year.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Growth Lagging Behind Market Peers</h2> <ul> <li>JPX’s earnings are forecast to grow just 2.3% per year and revenue at 2.7% per year, both well below the Japanese market averages of 7.9% and 4.5% respectively.</li> <li>Prevailing narrative sees the company as a reliable “picks-and-shovels” play in a buoyant equity market, but these muted growth rates challenge claims of outsized upside:\n    <ul> <li>Institutional and retail enthusiasm for stable revenue streams may cushion sentiment, even as headline growth underperforms the broader market.</li> <li>Expectations for meaningful acceleration rest heavily on broader market conditions, not on JPX’s organic drivers or innovation pace.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Valuation Premium Signals Heightened Expectations</h2> <ul> <li>The price-to-earnings ratio of 28x stands well above both industry and peer averages, while the current share price of 1,724.00 is also above the DCF fair value estimate of 964.25.</li> <li>This valuation gap heavily supports the view that investors are pricing in continued operational strength, but also increases vulnerability if profit growth stalls:\n    <ul> <li>Compared to other Japanese exchanges, the company’s market price points toward high market conviction in its systemically important role and steady business profile.</li> <li>However, the limited expected earnings growth means deliverables must remain solid to justify this premium over time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/jp/diversified-financials/tse-8697/japan-exchange-group-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our latest analysis for Japan Exchange Group.</a></p> <h2> Next Steps</h2> <p>Don't just look at this quarter; the real story is in the long-term trend.

            "title": "What Do Recent Partnerships Mean for Harmonic’s True Value in 2025?",
            "description": "<div class=\"sc-e15375e9-4 fgtIxR\" data-cy-id=\"article-content\"><ul> <li>Thinking of investing in Harmonic but want to know if you're getting a good deal? Let's break down what might make this stock a value play or not.</li> <li>The stock has shown recent signs of life, rising 2.4% in the last week and 4.6% over the past month. However, it is still down 18.6% year-to-date.</li> <li>Much of the recent price movement comes after industry-wide optimism about streaming technology and a series of partnerships announced by Harmonic. These developments have helped boost sentiment, and investors are taking notice, hoping they could translate into longer-term growth and potentially shift the company's risk profile.</li> <li>On our valuation checks, Harmonic scores a <a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3/6</a>. This means it appears undervalued in half of the main metrics we review. We'll get into the details of how these scores are calculated in a moment, but stay with us for a more insightful way to judge true value coming up at the end of this article.</li> </ul> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_industry_underperformer\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/future\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find out why Harmonic's -4.0% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.</a></p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\" data-theme=\"light\" id=\"sws-ad-slot\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-2390341812853401\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-slot=\"4932112108\" data-full-width-responsive=\"false\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;width:100%;height:100%\"></ins></div></div><h3>Approach 1: Harmonic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</h3> <p>The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model works by projecting a company’s future free cash flows and then discounting them back to today’s value to estimate what the business is intrinsically worth. This method gives a sense of what the stock should be worth based on its future earnings potential, not just its current profits.</p> <p>For Harmonic, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $119.2 Million, highlighting a healthy level of cash generation. According to analyst estimates and model extrapolation, free cash flow in 2026 is projected to be $69.7 Million, with a decline over the next decade to around $35 Million by 2035. While analysts typically offer cash flow projections only a few years out, the model extends these estimates to provide a longer-term view.</p> <p>Based on these projections, Harmonic’s intrinsic value is calculated as $5.15 per share. With the current share price at more than double this figure, the DCF model indicates the stock is about 107% overvalued at this time.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <p>Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Harmonic may be overvalued by 107.0%. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/168/undervalued-stocks-based-on-cash-flows\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 839 undervalued stocks</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_overvalued\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/screener/create\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own screener</a> to find better value opportunities.</p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/dcf\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>HLIT Discounted Cash Flow as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"dcf_explainer_cta\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Harmonic.</a></p> <h3>Approach 2: Harmonic Price vs Earnings</h3> <p>For profitable companies like Harmonic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used methods for stock valuation. The PE ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, making it a practical gauge of market sentiment and perceived potential.</p> <p>Typically, a company with strong growth prospects or lower risk will command a higher PE ratio, while those facing uncertainty warrant a lower multiple. Factors such as expected earnings growth, profitability, and industry trends all play crucial roles in shaping what is considered a “normal” or “fair” PE for a particular business.</p> <p>At present, Harmonic trades at a PE ratio of 17.6x. This is significantly below both the peer average of 28.9x and the communications industry average of 33.5x. This suggests the market is pricing in more caution or slower growth for Harmonic. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio model, which uniquely considers the company’s growth forecasts, profit margins, risks, industry, and market cap, calculates Harmonic’s fair PE at 22.9x. Unlike simply comparing to peers or industry, the Fair Ratio fine-tunes expectations to the individual company traits that matter most to investors.</p> <p>With its current PE ratio of 17.6x compared to a Fair Ratio of 22.9x, Harmonic’s stock appears undervalued according to this approach.</p> <p><strong>Result: UNDERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT PE Ratio as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p>PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership/global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discover 1391 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth</a>.</p> <h3>Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Harmonic Narrative</h3> <p>Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, approachable tool that lets you create your own story about a company and connect it directly to a set of financial forecasts, such as fair value, future revenue, and margins, based on your own expectations or assumptions.</p> <p>On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to review, refine, and share their perspectives, linking Harmonic’s latest business developments or competitive strengths directly to customized valuation models. This makes it easy to decide whether to buy or sell when comparing fair value against the current share price.</p> <p>Narratives stay dynamic, automatically updating when new news emerges, earnings are reported, or company guidance changes, so your investment view never goes out of date.</p> <p>For example, one Harmonic Narrative might reflect a bullish view, projecting a fair value of $12.5 per share based on expanding broadband demand and recurring SaaS revenue. A more cautious Narrative might cite technology risks or customer concentration for a fair value of just $7.0 per share. Narratives let you choose which outlook best fits your beliefs and investment approach.</p> <p>For Harmonic, we will make it easy for you with previews of two leading Harmonic Narratives:</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/hlit-market-outlook?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Harmonic Bull Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $12.10</p> <p>Current Price is 12% below the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 5.0%</p> <ul> <li>Highlights Harmonic’s strong positioning in the broadband and video delivery sectors, with Tier-1 telecom partnerships and a low price-to-earnings ratio compared to peers.</li> <li>There are significant tailwinds from broadband expansion, 5G deployment, and recurring SaaS/cloud revenue streams supporting multi-year growth.</li> <li>Cautions on execution risks and reliance on a few large customers, but notes the stock may offer a compelling mix of value and growth for a mid-term investment horizon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <a href=\"/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/njadqcqc-lifting-industry-headwinds-will-support-broader-demand-and-market-momentum-ahead?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Harmonic Bear Case</strong></a> <p>Fair Value: $10.50</p> <p>Current Price is 1.4% above the narrative fair value</p> <p>Revenue Growth Rate: 0.3%</p> <ul> <li>Emphasizes the risks from customer concentration, rapid technology changes, and increased competition, which may pressure revenues and margins.</li> <li>Harmonic’s shift to higher-margin SaaS and cloud products could drive future earnings, but the transition may introduce near-term volatility and execution challenges.</li> <li>Sees the current share price as close to fair value, with modest upside, and suggests investors closely monitor customer trends and industry dynamics.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for Harmonic? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-hlit/harmonic/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025\" class=\"sc-8e1a88f-0 jKVhTH\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/61d22440-b792-49aa-ad53-1310ecdcd85c/chart/community-fair-value\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:HLIT Community Fair Values as at Oct 2025</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Revenue, meanwhile, is expected to grow by 5.3% annually, which is below the broader US market’s 10.3% rate and puts margin trends further in the spotlight.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/us/real-estate/nyse-irt/independence-realty-trust\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Independence Realty Trust.</a> <p>The real test is how these numbers compare to prevailing market narratives.
