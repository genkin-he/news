Keystone Investors’ full exit raises questions about sentiment but does not, on its own, change the near term focus on subscriber growth, average revenue per user and content cost control as the key catalyst and risk.</p> <p>The most relevant recent announcement is Tencent Music’s plan to release Q4 2025 and full year 2025 results in March 2026, which should clarify how far the business has progressed in growing paid users and subscription ARPPU relative to rising content and marketing spend. Against the backdrop of a weaker recent share price, this earnings update may be an important checkpoint for investors weighing Keystone’s exit against Tencent Music’s evolving subscription driven model.</p> <p>Yet investors should also weigh how rising content costs and tighter regulation could limit the benefits of this subscription pivot and...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/us/media/nyse-tme/tencent-music-entertainment-group/bvn9nv53-rising-smartphone-usage-and-fan-economy-will-transform-entertainment-iijt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Tencent Music Entertainment Group (it's free!)</a></p><p>Tencent Music Entertainment Group's narrative projects CN¥45.8 billion revenue and CN¥13.7 billion earnings by 2028.

width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NYSE:HD Earnings &amp; Revenue History as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <h2>Margins Ease From 9.3% To 8.6%</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing basis, net profit margin is 8.6% compared with 9.3% a year earlier, on revenue of about US$164.7b and net income of about US$14.2b.</li> <li>Bears point to this margin slip as a sign that rising costs and mix are biting, yet the consensus narrative also highlights long term drivers such as Pro services and higher ticket projects:\n    <ul> <li>Consensus narrative flags expanding Pro ecosystems and complex project demand as long term supports, while the five year earnings trend shows about a 1.4% annual decline, so the current 8.6% margin does not yet reflect those longer term ambitions.</li> <li>Critics highlight guided operating margins around 13% versus 14.5% last year and slower inventory turns, which aligns with the move from 9.3% to 8.6% net margin and keeps the bearish focus on cost pressure and profitability strain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Home Depot's margin trend sits between bulls talking up efficiency gains and bears worried about rising costs, so it is worth understanding how each side is framing the same 8.6% result. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Home Depot Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Same Store Sales Turn From 1.8% Decline To 0.3% Growth</h2> <ul> <li>On a trailing 12 month basis, same store sales moved from a 1.8% decline a year ago to 0.3% growth now, with quarterly prints ranging from a 0.3% decline in Q1 FY 2026 to 1% growth in Q2 and 0.4% growth in Q4.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks about pent up demand for renovations and aging housing stock supporting long term activity, and the recent same store sales trend gives a mixed read on that bullish view:\n    <ul> <li>What stands out is that same store sales moved from declines in FY 2025 and early FY 2026 to small positive growth, which is consistent with the idea that demand has not collapsed, even as larger projects are being deferred.</li> <li>At the same time, growth around 0% is modest compared with the stronger backdrop implied by surveys about deferred big ticket projects, so the current store level numbers do not yet fully reflect the upbeat home improvement demand described by optimistic investors.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are trying to connect these small same store gains with the bigger renovation story, it helps to see how bullish and cautious takes line up against the actual 0.3% growth path. <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 Home Depot Bull Case</strong></a> <h2>P/E Of 26.4x And DCF Fair Value Gap</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade on a trailing P/E of 26.4x at a price of US$375.57, with a DCF fair value of about US$314.70 and an analyst consensus price target of about US$407.30, while the 2.48% dividend yield and high debt level round out the picture.</li> <li>Consensus narrative frames Home Depot as a high quality, slower growth retailer, and the valuation numbers highlight the trade off investors are weighing:\n    <ul> <li>Supporters point to high quality earnings and a 2.48% yield, and the trailing revenue base of about US$164.7b with net income of about US$14.2b shows a large, profitable business that some investors feel justifies a P/E slightly above the US Specialty Retail average of 20.1x and roughly in line with peers at 26.9x.</li> <li>Skeptics focus on the share price sitting above the DCF fair value of about US$314.70 and the presence of high debt, and they argue that with forecast revenue growth around 3.8% and earnings growth around 5.9% per year, the premium multiple and gap to DCF fair value leave less room for error.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next

margin move gives them some support, yet:\n    <ul> <li>Trailing earnings growth over five years is still positive at about 1.1% per year, which shows profits have held up over a multi year span even with the recent margin shift.</li> <li>Analysts in the bearish camp still model margins at 21.3% over the next few years, so the current 16.2% level has not pushed bearish forecasts toward a weaker

Building industry average of 22.6x.</li> <li>Bulls point to this mix of earnings and pricing as supportive for upside, and the current data gives them several talking points:\n    <ul> <li>The stock

This move sits at the heart of the current catalyst debate: some investors may see dividend preservation, even at a lower level, as a sign that management is trying to balance shareholder returns with cash retention, while others may worry it signals tighter financial headroom just as Imerys faces heavy capex and litigation overhangs.</p> <p>Yet behind the reduced dividend, investors should also be aware that Imerys still faces...</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/community/narratives/fr/materials/epa-nk/imerys-shares/drjq7bzf-emili-lithium-and-ev-demand-will-shape-future-markets-2jqx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full narrative on Imerys (it's free!)</a></p><p>Imerys' narrative projects €3.8 billion revenue and €405.1 million earnings by 2028.

margin, compared with 16.1% a year earlier.</li> <li>Consensus narrative talks up the idea that necessity focused retail and industrial tenants plus long leases can support stable, long term rent and dividend growth, and the recent numbers line up with that story:\n    <ul> <li>Trailing FFO of US$3.9b and FFO per share of US$4.26 sit alongside five year earnings growth of 19% per year and a 4.91% dividend yield, which backs the view that cash generation has been solid enough to support regular payouts.</li> <li>At the same time, the one off US$317.9m loss in the last 12 months shows that even with stable tenants, unusual items can still affect reported earnings, so the income story is not completely risk free.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Over US$3.9b in FFO, an 18.4% margin, and a 4.91% yield

the current share price of US$65.99 is below the DCF fair value of US$100.37 and under the analyst price target of US$65.25.</li> <li>Bears focus on valuation and concentration risks, and the current data gives them some clear talking points as well as a few pushbacks:\n    <ul> <li>The 58.2x P/E is more than double the sector average, so critics who say investors are paying a high multiple relative to other retail REITs can point straight to that gap.</li> <li>On the other hand, a DCF fair value of US$100.37 and a price target of US$65.25 compared with a US$65.99 share price mean valuation signals are mixed rather than uniformly stretched, which does not cleanly match a simple overvaluation claim.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> If you are weighing whether that 58.2x P/E is justified

Case</strong></a><br/> <h2>Interest Coverage And One Off Loss Stand Out</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last 12 months, earnings of US$1.1b on revenue of US$5.8b came alongside a US$317.9m one off loss and flagged weak interest coverage, where interest payments are not well covered by earnings.</li> <li>Analysts' consensus view highlights both resilient rent collections and growing international exposure, and the latest figures give you a way to test how balanced that really is:\n    <ul> <li>Net profit margin at 18.4% and trailing earnings growth of 24.8% over the past year support the idea that the core portfolio is still producing healthy profits relative to revenue.</li> <li>Yet, the large US$317.9m one off loss and the warning that interest expense is not well covered by earnings underline that the capital structure is a key watchpoint, especially as Realty Income increases its European exposure and potentially adds more debt to fund deals.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next

The goal is to estimate what the business might be worth per share at present.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, based on cash flow projections in $. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $106 million. Analysts and internal estimates project annual free cash flow rising to $513.3 million by 2035, with specific forecast points such as $288.4 million in 2026 and $391 million in 2029. Simply Wall St notes that analysts typically provide up to 5 years of estimates, and the later years are extrapolated within the model.</p> <p>Bringing all those projected cash flows back to today, the DCF produces an estimated intrinsic value of $63.24 per share, compared with the recent share price of C$62.66. That difference suggests the stock is approximately 0.9% undervalued, which is a very small gap.</p> <p><strong>Result: ABOUT RIGHT</strong></p> <p>OR Royalties is fairly valued according to our <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_dcf_fairly_valued\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</a>, but this can change at a moment's notice.

Investors typically accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as lower risk, and a lower P/E when growth expectations or risk levels are more modest.</p> <p>OR Royalties currently trades on a P/E of 41.68x. That is higher than both the Metals and Mining industry average P/E of 22.52x and the peer average of 24.97x. On the surface, that suggests the market is paying a richer price for each dollar of OR Royalties' earnings compared with many sector peers.</p> <p>Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio for OR Royalties is 20.33x. This is a proprietary estimate of what a reasonable P/E could be, given the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics. Because it blends these factors, the Fair Ratio can give you a more tailored reference point than a simple comparison with peer or industry averages. With the current P/E of 41.68x sitting well above the Fair Ratio of 20.33x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

Here you attach a clear story about OR Royalties to your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, link that story to a financial forecast and a Fair Value, compare that Fair Value to the current price to decide whether the stock looks attractive or not, and then see it update automatically when new news or earnings arrive. For example, one investor might build a more cautious OR Royalties Narrative that aligns with a Fair Value of about C$52.24, while another might build a more optimistic Narrative closer to C$80.37, each reflecting different views on how projects progress, margins develop and what P/E the market is likely to accept.</p> <p>For OR Royalties, here are previews of two leading OR Royalties Narratives:</p> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/2p5htw37-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bull_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OR Royalties Bull Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$80.37</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 22% below this bullish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 30.30% a year</p> <ul> <li>Analysts in this camp model faster growth in royalty volumes from Canadian Malartic, Odyssey Underground and other Tier 1 assets, supported by a mix of gold and growing silver exposure.</li> <li>The narrative focuses on a debt free balance sheet and roughly US$1b of available liquidity to support new royalty and streaming deals that could influence revenue and free cash flow per share.</li> <li>To line up with this view, you would need to be comfortable with earnings rising to US$337.1m by 2028, higher profit margins near 62.5% and a P/E of about 41.3x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares/8vp0ahtl-update-for-or-royalties?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 OR Royalties Bear Case</strong></a></p> <p>Fair value: C$52.24</p> <p>Gap to fair value: about 20% above this bearish fair value based on the recent C$62.66 share price</p> <p>Assumed revenue growth: 21.96% a year</p> <ul> <li>This view highlights execution risk at assets such as Canadian Malartic, Dalgaranga and CSA, where timelines, recoveries and mine planning could influence how quickly additional gold equivalent ounces reach OR Royalties.</li> <li>It also considers the possibility that new deals arrive more slowly if management keeps a tight filter on pricing and contract quality in a competitive royalty market.</li> <li>To agree with this stance, you would need to assume earnings of about US$281.0m by 2029, margins around 63.6% and a lower, but still elevated, P/E of about 31.8x on those earnings.</li> </ul> <p>These two Narratives show how different assumptions about growth, project execution and valuation multiples can lead to very different fair values for the same stock. The key is to decide which set of assumptions aligns more closely with your own view of OR Royalties and its royalty portfolio.</p> <p>Do you think there's more to the story for OR Royalties? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_create_narrative_community\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stock/TSX/OR\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Head over to our Community to see what others are saying!</a></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/ca/materials/tsx-or/or-royalties-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/586d5568-d92a-420b-8bdf-8bed829971e7/chart/quote-price?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>TSX:OR 1-Year Stock Price Chart</figcaption></figure> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Investors usually accept a higher P/E when they expect stronger growth or see the earnings as relatively resilient, and a lower P/E when they see more risk or slower growth.</p> <p>Linde currently trades on a P/E of 34.41x. That sits above the broader Chemicals industry average P/E of 24.38x and below the peer group average of 40.17x. Simply comparing with peers or the industry gives you a rough sense of how the market is pricing Linde, but it does not adjust for the company’s specific earnings growth profile, profit margins, size or risk.</p> <p>To address that, Simply Wall St estimates a “Fair Ratio” for Linde of 28.92x. This is a proprietary P/E level that reflects factors such as the company’s earnings growth, its industry, profit margins, market capitalization and risk profile. Because it is tailored to the company, this Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the sector. With the current P/E of 34.41x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 28.92x, the shares screen as overvalued on this metric.</p> <p><strong>Result: OVERVALUED</strong></p> <figure><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"infographic\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st//stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-lin/linde/valuation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026\" class=\"sc-3204b94-0 iJdSPa\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.simplywall.st/company/eb5ee3aa-9d1a-4bb1-8127-16e0748e83af/chart/pe-multiple-vs-industry?date=2026-02-26\" width=\"746\"/></a><figcaption>NasdaqGS:LIN P/E Ratio as at Feb 2026</figcaption></figure> <p>P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_preferred_multiple_contextual\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/473625/top-founder-led-companies/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Start investing in legacies, not executives.

On Simply Wall St this comes through Narratives, where you set out your own story for Linde, link that story to specific forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins, and then see a Fair Value that you can compare with the current price. All of this is available within an easy tool on the Community page that updates automatically when new earnings or news arrive. For instance, one investor might build a more optimistic Linde Narrative that lines up with a higher fair value closer to US$576, based on stronger long term project expectations.

The company has seen revenue move from €5.1b and EPS of €0.49 in H2 2024 to €5.3b and EPS of €0.63 in H1 2025, compared with a prior H1 2024 reference point of €5.4b in revenue and EPS of €0.69.

The margin lift from 1.6% to 1.8% partly lines up with that, yet the latest half year still shows net income of €90 million on €5.3b of revenue, which is a slim margin, so the bullish view relies on this recent margin level being a base, not a peak.\n    <ul> <li>The bullish narrative talks about margin expansion from around 1.5% to 3.5% over several years, while the trailing 1.8% margin shows some progress but is still far from that 3.5% figure.</li> <li>H1 FY 2025 net income of €90 million is below the €100 million from H1 FY 2024, so the short term pattern does not yet fully match the stronger and more resilient earnings path bulls are hoping for.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Stronger recent margins and earnings growth look like early support for the bullish story, but the gap between a 1.8% margin today and much higher targets keeps the bull case very dependent on future execution that is not yet in the half year numbers. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/j0gp2vpb-global-electric-adoption-will-expand-connected-vehicle-ecosystems-x1jh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐂 OPmobility Bull Case</strong></a></p> <h2>Valuation Gap Versus €39.56 DCF Fair Value</h2> <ul> <li>The shares trade at €17.63 with a trailing P/E of 13.6x, while the provided DCF fair value is €39.56, which is 55.4% above the current price, and the P/E sits above a 12.2x peer average but below the 14x wider European Auto Components group.</li> <li>Consensus narrative points out that the market might be baking in ambitious growth and margin gains. The tension shows up here, because the wide gap between €17.63 and the €39.56 DCF fair value looks supportive for optimists, yet the higher P/E than peers and analyst price target level of €17.94 both suggest other investors are more cautious than that DCF implies.\n    <ul> <li>Analysts expect earnings to rise to €291.9 million by around 2028 with margins moving from roughly 1.5% to 2.7%, but the current trailing earnings base of €185 million and 1.8% margin means that uplift still needs to come through.</li> <li>The consensus target of €17.94 is only slightly above the current €17.63 price and well below the €39.56 DCF fair value, which shows how differently the cash flow model and analyst targets are treating future growth and risk.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Debt And Dividend Track Record Under Bear Scrutiny</h2> <ul> <li>Risk flags highlight a high level of debt and an unstable dividend history, alongside relatively modest forecast revenue growth of about 2% per year versus a 5.6% market benchmark, even as trailing earnings grew 8.8% and 5 year earnings growth is cited at 16.9% per year.</li> <li>Bears focus on the combination of debt, legacy product exposure and pressure from EV and ESG shifts, and the numbers give them some support, because modest revenue growth expectations alongside that debt profile and an uneven dividend record can limit flexibility if conditions stay tough, even though recent earnings growth and margin improvement mean the company is not matching the more severe earnings pressure that a very bearish view might suggest.\n    <ul> <li>Forecast earnings growth of about 15.1% per year contrasts with only 2% revenue growth, which fits with a bear concern that cost cutting and mix, rather than broad based top line growth, are doing a lot of the work.</li> <li>The unstable dividend and leverage risk do not show up directly in the half year income statement, yet they sit in the background when you weigh how sustainable a 1.8% margin and 8.8% earnings growth might be if the auto cycle or regulation turns less helpful.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you are weighing those balance sheet and revenue risks against</p>Next Steps\n<p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/trzoo1aa-analysts-raise-opmobility-price-target-citing-stable-margins-and-improved-risk-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for OPmobility on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>If this mix of optimism and concern feels finely balanced, now is a good time to look through the numbers yourself and stress test your view.

For you as an investor, the key point is the potential for longer term, contract based wafer demand tied to US based fabs, rather than one off, short cycle orders. That kind of arrangement can support more predictable factory loading and may help justify large capital projects in places such as New York and Vermont. At the same time, locking in capacity for one partner can limit flexibility if end demand shifts, so the quality of the commercial terms and any take or pay elements matter. Renesas gains access to a geographically diversified production base. GlobalFoundries deepens its role as a non leading edge foundry alongside players like TSMC and UMC in auto and industrial markets where supply security is often just as important as cutting edge nodes.</p> <div class=\"relative grid grid-rows-[25px_auto] place-items-center bg-surface @container/article-body-ad [[data-brand='v2']_&amp;]:bg-surface-1\" data-cy-id=\"article-body-ad\"><div class=\"text-tiny text-softer\">Advertisement</div><div class=\"relative h-[250px] min-h-[250px] w-[300px] min-w-[300px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-h-[280px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:w-[336px] @[380px]/article-body-ad:min-w-[336px]\"><div data-fuse=\"news_incontent_1\" id=\"news_incontent_1\"></div></div></div><h3>How This Fits Into The GlobalFoundries Narrative</h3> <ul> <li>The partnership lines up with the narrative focus on automotive and communications chips, and on long term agreements that can support scale benefits in US and European fabs.</li> <li>It could test the narrative around capital efficiency if meeting Renesas demand requires higher upfront spending or lowers pricing power compared with other customers.</li> <li>The specific emphasis on supply chain resiliency and on shoring for a Japanese chipmaker is not fully captured in the existing storyline and may add another angle to GlobalFoundries role in government supported manufacturing.</li> </ul> <p>Knowing what a company is worth starts with understanding its story.\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"integrated-pitch\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/narratives/y3o719pn-expanding-us-and-european-capacity-will-unlock-new-demand-66dr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out one of the top narratives in the Simply Wall St Community for GlobalFoundries</a> to help decide what it's worth to you.</p> <h3>The Risks and Rewards Investors Should Consider</h3> <ul> <li>⚠️ Higher capital spending to support dedicated capacity for Renesas could pressure free cash flow if wafer volumes or pricing do not match expectations.</li> <li>⚠️ Concentrating more output on auto and industrial customers may increase exposure to sector specific cycles and competition from foundries such as TSMC and Samsung expanding their own regional capacity.</li> <li>🎁 A multi billion dollar, long term partnership can support better capacity utilization, revenue visibility, and closer product co development with a key customer.</li> <li>🎁 The focus on US, European, and Asian facilities supports the reward theme of regionally diversified manufacturing that may appeal to customers prioritizing supply security and government incentives.</li> </ul> <h3>What To Watch Going Forward</h3> <p>From here, keep an eye on any extra disclosures around the duration, minimum volume, and pricing framework of the Renesas agreement, because those details will shape how you think about GlobalFoundries earnings quality. Updates on capacity plans at its US fabs, and whether Renesas production later extends to Germany, Singapore, and China, will also signal how embedded this relationship becomes. Comparing GlobalFoundries order trends and long term deals with peers like TSMC and UMC can help you judge whether the company is keeping pace in auto and industrial markets. Finally, management commentary on capital intensity and returns on new projects will be important to track as more of the portfolio is tied to supply chain resilience programs.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for GlobalFoundries, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/GFS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for GlobalFoundries</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

The narrative is based on steady revenue expansion, resilient margins, and a future earnings multiple that is still below many peers.

While our model-based fair value of $95.62 points to Unum Group as undervalued, the current P/E of 16.1x sits well above the US Insurance industry at 12.1x and the peer average at 11.1x, and only slightly below a fair ratio of 16.8x.</p> <p>In practical terms, that means the market already prices Unum at a premium to many insurers, with less room for error if earnings or margins disappoint.

This means:\n    <ul> <li>TTM net income moved from a loss of US$33.4 million in Q4 2024 to a smaller loss of US$18.6 million in Q4 2025, so the company is closer to break even but not yet there.</li> <li>Quarterly figures inside that period swung from a US$13.1 million profit in Q3 2025 to a US$48.3 million loss in Q4 2025, which challenges the idea of a smooth path toward the bullish earnings forecasts.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> On these numbers, bulls are essentially arguing that a business still reporting a TTM loss can grow into those forecasts relatively quickly, which is an optimistic read on how fast profitability can improve. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bull_narrative_link\"

Case</strong></a> <h2>US$48.3 million Q4 loss vs earlier 2025 profits</h2> <ul> <li>Within FY 2025, AMG moved from net income of US$5.0 million, US$11.5 million and US$13.1 million in Q1, Q2 and Q3 to a net loss of US$48.3 million in Q4, even as quarterly revenue stayed in a fairly tight band between US$388.1 million and US$446.6 million.</li> <li>Bears highlight that heavy capital spending and exposure to commodity prices can hit earnings hard, and this pattern fits that cautious view because:\n    <ul> <li>Losses over the past five years have widened at roughly 6% per year and the latest TTM period still ends in the red, which lines up with concerns about long stretches of uneven profitability.</li> <li>Interest payments are flagged as not well covered by earnings, so a quarter like Q4 2025 with a US$48.3 million loss adds weight to worries about financial pressure if similar periods repeat.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Skeptics point to this swing back into a sizeable loss as evidence that the path to steady profits may be rougher than headline growth forecasts imply. <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_bear_narrative_link\"

Materials Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Low P/S and DCF fair value create valuation tension</h2> <ul> <li>At a share price of €33.04, AMG is trading on a P/S of 0.7x compared with peer and industry averages of 5.7x and 0.9x, and sits well below a DCF fair value estimate of €60.83.</li> <li>Consensus narrative suggests the stock looks inexpensive while still facing meaningful financial risk, and the data backs both sides of that tension because:\n    <ul> <li>The gap between the €33.04 price and the €60.83 DCF fair value points to valuation support, even after factoring in that analysts as a group only see roughly 25.6% implied upside to their price target of €41.49.</li> <li>At the same time, the company remains unprofitable on a TTM basis and interest coverage is described as weak, so any case that the current P/S discount is attractive also needs to factor in these ongoing balance sheet and earnings risks.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie

This raises questions about how quickly capital projects and regulatory outcomes will flow through to earnings.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative highlights multi year capital plans of about US$3b and a pipeline of over 3,000 megawatts of potential new load as drivers for higher margins, while the actual trailing margin improvement from 9.3% to 9.8% is more modest in comparison.</li> <li>At the same time, the trailing 12 month earnings growth figure of roughly 7.2% lines up with the long run 7.4% annualized growth the consensus references, so the earnings side of that story is currently closer to the script than the faster margin lift analysts are hoping for.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2>Earnings Growth Outpaces Slower Revenue</h2> <ul> <li>Over the last year, earnings grew about 7.2% while revenue is forecast at roughly 2% annual growth, and trailing 12 month EPS of US$2.38 on US$1.964b of revenue underscores that most of the progress is coming from profitability rather than rapid top line expansion.</li> <li>Supporters of the bullish narrative argue that accelerating electrification and over 3,000 megawatts of large load inquiries can support stronger revenue ahead. However, the current revenue base of about US$1.964b and the 2% revenue growth forecast show a slower build than the more upbeat demand story might suggest.</li> <ul> <li>The consensus narrative talks about potential revenues of US$2.1b and earnings of US$245.2 million by around 2028, but today Avista is at US$1.964b of revenue and US$193 million of net income, which means a meaningful gap still needs to be closed.</li> <li>Analysts also expect EPS of US$2.94 by about 2028 compared with trailing EPS of roughly US$2.38, so while the 7.2% earnings growth rate so far is consistent with that direction, the modest revenue assumptions suggest a heavier reliance on margin and rate outcomes than on pure volume growth.</li> </ul> </ul> <p>Skeptics warn that this kind of earnings profile can be vulnerable if large load projects or regulatory approvals slip, so it is worth comparing the current US$2.38 EPS and 7.2% growth to the US$2.94 EPS target investors are building into their expectations before deciding how much risk you are comfortable taking on at a US$40.61 share price relative to the US$41.00 analyst target.</p> <a href=\"?utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta_bear_narrative_link&amp;utm_source=post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>🐻 Avista Bear Case</strong></a> <h2>Valuation Support Versus Cash Flow Strain</h2> <ul> <li>Avista trades on a trailing P/E of 17.1x, which is below the Global Integrated Utilities industry average of 19.1x and well below the peer average of 25.5x, while offering a 4.83% dividend yield that is not well covered by free cash flows and interest payments that are not well covered by earnings over the trailing 12 months.</li> <li>Bulls argue that the combination of below peer P/E and expected earnings growth of about 7.4% a year makes the current valuation attractive. However, the flagged risks around cash coverage and interest costs show that the lower multiple and higher yield come with trade offs that investors need to weigh carefully.</li> <ul> <li>The current share price of US$40.61 is close to the US$41.00 consensus analyst target and only slightly above the DCF fair value estimate of about US$37.92, so there is not a large valuation gap that would offset concerns about dividend and interest coverage.</li> <li>At the same time, earnings of US$193 million on US$1.964b of revenue with a 9.8% margin and a 4.83% yield support the idea of a steady utility profile, but the fact that free cash flow does not fully cover\n<h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>To see how these results tie into long-term growth, risks, and valuation, check out the full range of <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/narratives/tw3gqe02-ava-long-term-earnings-growth-will-steady-energy-delivery-outlook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community narratives</a> for Avista on Simply Wall St. Add the company to your <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/stock-watchlist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">watchlist</a> or <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"conclusion_cta_when_narratives_exist\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portfolio</a> so you'll be alerted when the story evolves.</p> <p>Mixed messages in the data, or a balanced risk and reward story that suits your style?

See which could impact your investment.</a></p> <p>Nebius Group’s decision to lean on upfront payments from large customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms shifts part of the financing burden from lenders and equity markets to its own client base. For you as an investor, that means liquidity is tied more closely to contract execution and less to capital market conditions. Long dated agreements and customer prepayments can smooth cash inflows and give clearer visibility over future revenue, but they also concentrate exposure in a small group of hyperscale clients. The aggressive data center build out and the Tavily acquisition indicate that Nebius is trying to move up the stack from pure infrastructure into more software rich, enterprise grade AI cloud services, putting it in more direct competition with Amazon, Alphabet and other cloud providers.

Integration of Tavily into the broader platform, and customer uptake of higher value AI software services versus pure compute, will also help indicate whether Nebius can build a defensible position against larger cloud peers.</p> <p>To ensure you're always in the loop on how the latest news impacts the investment narrative for Nebius Group, head to the\n<a class=\"company-report-links\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stock/NasdaqGS/NBIS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community page for Nebius Group</a> to never miss an update on the top community narratives.</p> <p><em> This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature. <strong>We provide commentary based on historical data\n    and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice.</strong> It does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock, and does not take account of your objectives, or your\n    financial situation.

Over recent halves the company has seen revenue move from A$74.6 million in H2 2024 to A$136.1 million in H1 2025 and A$200.7 million in H2 2025, while basic EPS shifted from A$0.84 to A$0.01 and then A$0.10. This gives investors a clearer view of how reported profit tracks against the expanding top line. With trailing net profit margins at 23.8% and below the prior year, this result is likely to focus attention on how sustainably Kingsgate can convert that higher revenue base into earnings.</p> <a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_company_latest_analysis_earnings\" href=\"https://www.simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-kcn/kingsgate-consolidated-shares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See our full analysis for Kingsgate Consolidated.</a> <p>With the headline figures on the board, the next step is to see how this earnings profile lines up against the widely shared narratives around Kingsgate’s growth, risks, and profitability, and where the fresh numbers push back against those views.</p> <p><a class=\"company-report-links\" data-vars-link-type=\"cta_generic_community_narrative\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/features/community-narratives\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Curious how numbers become stories that shape markets?
