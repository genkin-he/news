The online brokerage initially gained a lot of attention during the buying frenzy in growth and meme stocks, but it lost its luster as interest rates rose and its growth cooled off.</p><p>So should you consider buying Robinhood as a turnaround play? Or will the macro, regulatory, and competitive challenges weigh down its stock and keep it far below its IPO price?</p>\n<img alt=\"A person checks a portfolio on a smartphone.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F786642%2Fwoman-check-phone.jpg&amp;w=700\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Getty Images.</p>\n<h2>Robinhood is bouncing back from a tough slowdown</h2><p>Robinhood initially carved out a niche among smaller retail investors with its commission-free trades, streamlined app, and gamification of the trading process. It also offered gift stocks as rewards for new sign-ups and referrals.</p><p>Those perks made Robinhood a popular trading platform in 2021, when a combination of social media buzz and stimulus checks drove many retail investors to aggressively trade hypergrowth stocks, meme stocks, options, and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/15/1-top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-before-it-soars-260-ac/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f8cf947f-3075-49e0-927d-778eca35e116\" target=\"_blank\">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><company-card collapseonload=\"false\" defaultperiod=\"FiveYear\" instrument=\"345207\" name=\"Robinhood Markets\" showbenchmarkcompareonload=\"false\" symbol=\"NASDAQ:HOOD\"></company-card><p>By the end of 2021, its number of funded customers surged 81% to 22.7 million, its monthly active users (MAUs) grew 48% to 17.3 million, and its assets under custody (AUC) climbed 56% to $98 billion. Its total revenue rose 89% to $1.82 billion.</p><p>But in 2022, its number of funded customers only grew 1% to 23 million as its MAUs declined 34% to 11.4 million and its AUC plunged 37% to $62 billion. Its total revenue fell 25% to $1.36 billion. That slowdown was mainly caused by rising interest rates, which curbed the market's appetite for Robinhood's more speculative investments.</p>\n<p>In 2023, Robinhood's growth in funded customers and AUC offset its sluggish growth in MAUs. It also expanded its subscription-based Gold plan -- which offers higher interest rates on uninvested cash, bonuses on taxable deposits and IRA contributions, bigger instant deposits, lower margin rates, access to Level II trading data, and other perks -- to grow its average revenue per user (ARPU) as it gained fewer MAUs.</p><p>As a result, its revenue rose 37% to $1.87 billion in 2023 and exceeded its pandemic-era high in 2021. That trend continued this year as rebounding tech stocks (especially in the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f8cf947f-3075-49e0-927d-778eca35e116\" target=\"_blank\">AI market</a>) and the stabilization of crypto prices brought back the bulls. Robinhood's revenue rose 40% year over year in the first half of 2024, and analysts anticipate 38% growth for the full year.</p><section class=\"feed-table__wrapper\"><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"feed-table\" width=\"624\"><colgroup><col width=\"152\"/> <col width=\"80\"/> <col width=\"77\"/> <col width=\"79\"/> <col width=\"74\"/> <col width=\"76\"/> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\n<th width=\"152\">\n<p>Metric</p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"80\">\n<p>Q2 2023</p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"77\">\n<p>Q3 2023</p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"79\">\n<p>Q4 2023</p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"74\">\n<p>Q1 2024</p>\n</th>\n<th width=\"76\">\n<p>Q2 2024</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\n<td width=\"152\">\n<p>Funded customers</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"80\">\n<p>23.2 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"77\">\n<p>23.3 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"79\">\n<p>23.4 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"74\">\n<p>23.9 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"76\">\n<p>24.2 million</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\n<td width=\"152\">\n<p>MAUs</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"80\">\n<p>10.8 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"77\">\n<p>10.3 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"79\">\n<p>10.9 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"74\">\n<p>13.7 million</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"76\">\n<p>11.8 million</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign=\"TOP\">\n<td width=\"152\">\n<p>AUC</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"80\">\n<p>$89 billion</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"77\">\n<p>$87 billion</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"79\">\n<p>$103 billion</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"74\">\n<p>$130 billion</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"76\">\n<p>$140 billion</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></section><p class=\"caption\">Data source: Robinhood.</p><p>But based on its enterprise value of $34 billion, Robinhood still looks reasonably valued at 13 times this year's sales. Its larger competitor <strong>Charles Schwab</strong>, which is growing at a much slower rate, trades at 8 times this year's sales.</p><p>However, investors should pay attention to the competitive and regulatory threats. Most of Robinhood's larger competitors -- including Schwab, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s E*Trade, and Fidelity -- also offer commission-free stock trading. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also issued a Wells Notice (a warning of enforcement action) this May against Robinhood's crypto business, which accounted for a nearly quarter of its transaction-based revenues in the second quarter of 2024. Those headwinds might prevent jittery investors from paying a higher premium for Robinhood's stock.</p>\n<h2>Its margins and profits are rising</h2><p>From 2022 to 2023, Robinhood narrowed its net loss on a generally accepted accounting principles (<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generally-accepted-accounting-principles/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f8cf947f-3075-49e0-927d-778eca35e116\" target=\"_blank\">GAAP</a>) basis from $1.03 billion to $541 million. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (<a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/e/ebitda/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f8cf947f-3075-49e0-927d-778eca35e116\" target=\"_blank\">EBITDA</a>) rose from negative $94 million in 2022 to positive $536 million in 2023.</p><p>Those bottom-line improvements were driven by layoffs and other aggressive cost-cutting measures. In 2024, analysts expect Robinhood to finally turn profitable on a GAAP basis as it more than doubles its adjusted EBITDA to $1.08 billion.</p><p>Based on those expectations, Robinhood trades at 25 times this year's earnings and 32 times its adjusted EBITDA. By comparison, Schwab trades at 22 times this year's earnings and 15 times its adjusted EBITDA. The bulls will likely argue that Robinhood deserves its higher valuations because it's growing a lot faster.</p><h2>Is it the right time to buy Robinhood?</h2><p>Robinhood's growth metrics are stabilizing, its margins are expanding, and its valuations are attractive. Its near-term price might be driven by macro issues like interest rates, competitive concerns, or the SEC's potential crackdown on its crypto platform, but it could climb a lot higher if it overcomes those challenges. So for now, I think Robinhood is still worth buying at this steep discount to its IPO price -- as long as you're willing to ride out its volatile price swings.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Robinhood Markets right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Robinhood Markets, consider this:</p>\n<p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href=\"https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=4a660d0f-4148-40dd-9d77-c94fef05a275&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0010917%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_partners%26ftm_pit%3D14065&amp;utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f8cf947f-3075-49e0-927d-778eca35e116\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now\u2026 and Robinhood Markets wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "description": "<div class=\"body__content\">\n<p>Few investors command Wall Street's attention quite like <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"206249\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/brk.a\">(NYSE: BRK.A)</a></span><span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"206602\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/brk.b\">(NYSE: BRK.B)</a></span> CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking the reins in 1965, the appropriately named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has nearly doubled up the annualized total return of the benchmark <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>. On an aggregate basis, Buffett has overseen a gain of 5,174,441% in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on August 7.</p><p>Given <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/05/30/10-reasons-warren-buffett-is-a-successful-investor/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">how decisively Warren Buffett has crushed the S&amp;P 500</a>, it's no surprise that investors eagerly await clues as to what he and his team have been buying and selling.</p>\n<img alt=\"A pensive Warren Buffett surrounded by people at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F786465%2Fbuffett9-tmf.jpg&amp;w=700\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, these \"clues\" come in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/f/form-13f/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">13F filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F is a quarterly filing that provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest (and richest) money managers have purchased and sold. Berkshire's 13F detailing its activity during the June-ended quarter is slated for release after the closing bell on August 14.</p><p>But you don't always have to wait for Berkshire's 13F to know what the Oracle of Omaha and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been up to. Thanks to the company's quarterly operating results, annual shareholder meeting, and Form 4 filings with the SEC, we already know about three big moves that have been made.</p><p>Based on these various clues, which I'll touch on in more detail in a moment, I'd opine that Buffett is selling two additional holdings that Wall Street and investors don't yet know about.</p><h2>Warren Buffett has been a big-time net-seller of equities</h2><p>One stock we <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/07/warren-buffett-just-sold-90-billion-of-apple-stock/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">absolutely know the Oracle of Omaha has been dumping</a> is Berkshire Hathaway's longtime top holding, <strong>Apple</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"202686\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/aapl\">(NASDAQ: AAPL)</a></span>. Based on fair value estimates for Apple (as of June 30), which were highlighted in Berkshire's second-quarter operating results, we can approximate that nearly half of the 789.37 million shares that were held as of March 31 were sold over the subsequent three months.</p>\n<p>During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett suggested that corporate tax rates were liable to increase in the coming years. Given the sizable unrealized investment gains in Apple Berkshire's investment team is sitting on, Buffett believed that <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/22/warren-buffett-buy-77-billion-favorite-stock-apple/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">locking in some gains now</a>, at a lower tax rate, would be, in hindsight, viewed favorably by the investing community.</p><company-card collapseonload=\"false\" defaultperiod=\"FiveYear\" instrument=\"206636\" name=\"Paramount Global\" showbenchmarkcompareonload=\"false\" symbol=\"NASDAQ:PARA\"></company-card><p>Berkshire's annual meeting also <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/08/meet-2-stocks-warren-buffett-confessed-to-selling/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">shed light on another disposition that was widely telegraphed</a>. Buffett admitted that he -- and he alone -- had sold the entirety of his company's remaining stake in legacy media company <strong>Paramount Global</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"206636\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/para\">(NASDAQ: PARA)</a></span>. This remaining stake totaled 7,531,765 shares, as of March 31.</p><p>Legacy media companies like Paramount have been upended by streaming services and the high costs associated with building out the content libraries needed to compete for subscribers. Despite reducing its direct-to-consumer segment losses, Paramount has struggled to regain its footing. Buffett ultimately bit the bullet prior to Berkshire's shareholder meeting and dumped the remaining position.</p><p>Furthermore, Form 4 filings tell us that Buffett and his team have been actively selling shares of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/19/75-warren-buffett-portfolio-invested-in-5-stocks/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">No. 2 holding</a>, <strong>Bank of America</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"202908\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/bac\">(NYSE: BAC)</a></span>. Shareholders with a 10% or greater stake in a company are required to file Form 4 anytime shares are bought or sold.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/05/warren-buffett-selling-38-billion-bank-of-america/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">Over 12 consecutive trading sessions</a> (July 17 \u2013 Aug. 1), Buffett collectively sold 90,422,124 shares of Bank of America stock, totaling about $3.82 billion. There are a number of logical reasons for this position to be pared down by around 9%, including BofA's higher book value and the potential for a rate-easing cycle to commence in the coming months -- BofA is the most interest-sensitive of the money-center banks. But more than anything, this selling activity appears to be a warning to Wall Street that the stock market is incredibly pricey.</p>\n<p>Buffett has <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/06/warren-buffett-132-billion-warning-to-wall-street/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">sold more equities than he's purchased for seven consecutive quarters</a>, with $131.6 billion in aggregate net-equity sales since Oct. 1, 2022.</p><img alt=\"A businessperson pressing the sell button on an oversized digital screen.\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F786465%2Finvestor-pressing-sell-button-getty.jpg&amp;w=700\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">Image source: Getty Images.</p>\n<h2>Two stocks Buffett is likely selling that Wall Street doesn't know about yet</h2><p>In two days, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F will reveal the full scope of what moves were made in the second quarter.</p><p>However, Berkshire's second-quarter operating results offer a big clue as to what other trades may have been executed. More specifically, the fair value cost basis for the company's \"Commercial, industrial, and other\" segment declined from $46.026 billion on March 31, 2024 to $45.006 billion on June 30, 2024. This segment excludes financial stocks and consumer products, but includes a host of other sectors and industries.</p><p>Based on this fair value information, I believe Buffett pared down his stake in another top holding and completely exited one of Berkshire's smaller value plays.</p>\n<company-card collapseonload=\"false\" defaultperiod=\"FiveYear\" instrument=\"203255\" name=\"Chevron\" showbenchmarkcompareonload=\"false\" symbol=\"NYSE:CVX\"></company-card><h2>Prediction: Buffett pared down his stake in Chevron for a second consecutive quarter</h2><p>Let me preface this first prediction by noting that Warren Buffett would never bet against America. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/29/warren-buffett-56-billion-warning-to-wall-street/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">Buffett isn't oblivious to the possibility of a big sell-off in the stock market</a>. Equities are historically pricey, and the potential for energy commodities to take it on the chin if the U.S. economy falls into a recession is palpable.</p><p>With the above being said, it's a near-certainty that Buffett sold close to 4 million shares of oil and gas stock <strong>Chevron</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"203255\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/cvx\">(NYSE: CVX)</a></span> during the second quarter.</p><p>Although Wall Street has been laser-focused on Apple's fair value decline from the sequential quarter, they've overlooked that Chevron's $18.6 billion fair value, as of June 30, is about $0.6 billion shy of where it should be, assuming Buffett hadn't sold a single share.</p><p>Further, Berkshire Hathaway's brightest investment minds sold roughly 3.11 million shares of Chevron during the first quarter. Once the train gets rolling in either direction, it's pretty common for buying or selling activity to be a multi-quarter event for a security held by Buffett's company.</p><p>Lastly, with Buffett referring to <strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> as <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/04/29/8-phenomenal-stocks-warren-buffett-hold-forever/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">an \"indefinite\" holding</a> in his most recent annual letter to shareholders, there may not be a need to have so much capital tied up in Chevron. After all, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">energy stocks</a> have rarely played a key role in Berkshire's Hathaway's investment portfolio. As Berkshire's position in Occidental grows, it wouldn't be surprising to see a corresponding reduction in its stake in Chevron.</p>\n<company-card collapseonload=\"false\" defaultperiod=\"FiveYear\" instrument=\"204352\" name=\"Louisiana-Pacific\" showbenchmarkcompareonload=\"false\" symbol=\"NYSE:LPX\"></company-card><h2>Prediction: The Oracle of Omaha completely exited his company's position in Louisiana-Pacific</h2><p>My second prediction is that the Oracle of Omaha and/or his investment aides showed <strong>Louisiana-Pacific</strong> <span class=\"ticker\" data-id=\"204352\"><a href=\"/market-activity/stocks/lpx\">(NYSE: LPX)</a></span> to the door. Louisiana-Pacific is a provider of siding/outdoor building solutions used primarily in new construction.</p><p>When the first quarter came to a close, Berkshire held 6,597,947 shares of this premier building solutions company. However, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/31/here-are-all-6-stocks-warren-buffett-is-selling/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">446,942 shares were sold in the March-ended quarter</a>. With Berkshire's investment team often increasing or reducing their positions over the span of multiple quarters, it seems logical to expect this selling activity to have ramped up in the second quarter.</p><p>But there's more to this prediction than just \"it's what Buffett usually does.\"</p><p>When Treasury yields soared on the heels of the Federal Reserve's steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, it sent 30-year mortgage rates to a 23-year high last October. Bringing the existing-home sales market to a crawl <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/05/20/3-warren-buffett-stocks-screaming-buys-now/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">opened the door for new home sales to thrive</a>. Suppliers like Louisiana-Pacific were key beneficiaries.</p><p>However, with the Fed set to begin cutting interest rates, and mortgage rates declining, the luster for homebuilders and their suppliers may begin to wear off.</p>\n<p>The other issue for Louisiana-Pacific is that it's no longer a particularly intriguing investment from a value perspective -- its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/?utm_source=nasdaq&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=4da55d44-ab70-4783-9760-d01671190d70\" target=\"_blank\">forward price-to-earnings ratio</a> of 18.4 is 78% <em>above</em> its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period.
