that US and Israeli warplanes were attacking Iran.</p><p>Like many Iranians living in exile in neighbouring Turkey, Reza, who did not want to give his surname, has been glued to his phone since news broke that Israel and the United States had begun air strikes on Iran.</p><p>Despite worrying about their families, most exiles in Turkey&#39;s largest city told AFP they were happy with the strikes, which US President Donald Trump had threatened in January over Iran&#39;s protest crackdown that left thousands dead.</p><p>&quot;America is attacking the military bases, the people who 40 days ago were killing our children, so they are helping us. This war is no good, people will die, but I&#39;m happy,&quot; Reza, a mature student, told AFP.</p><p>Ali, a film director who like almost all the Iranians interviewed by AFP did not give his surname, agreed.</p><p>&quot;Now people in Iran are full of&nbsp;hope and they are very, very happy,&quot; Ali said.</p><p>&quot;Iranians have been counting the minutes until America came to destroy the regime.&quot;</p><p>Over the past few weeks, Trump has sent warships and dozens of fighter planes to the Middle East, raising fears of a US strike -- even as US and Iranians diplomats held indirect talks on Iran&#39;s nuclear programme.</p><p>But early on Saturday, the tensions came to a head as Israeli and US warplanes began hitting targets in Iran, with Trump urging Iranians to stand up to their government and telling them: &quot;The hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>Turkey, which shares a 500-kilometre (300-mile) border with Iran, currently hosts more than 74,000 Iranians with residence permits and some 5,000 refugees.</p><p>While the unrest has raised fears of an influx of people, there have been no reports of unusual activity at the Turkey-Iran border so far.</p><p>- &#39;Difficult days ahead&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I&#39;m both worried and happy, hoping for Iran&#39;s freedom,&quot; said Sepideh, a former teacher, who told AFP she managed to speak to a few friends in the morning, despite Iran cutting off all internet access.</p><p>Even with the internet shutdown, Mehdi, an engineer from the northern Iranian city of Tabriz, said he had managed to reach his family on Friday night.</p><p>&quot;Everyone was aware of the possibility of war, so they have been saving fuel and storing enough food. They are planning to move to rural areas,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We never wanted war in our country. It is the mullahs&#39; brutal theocracy that has put us in this situation,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t support Trump or Israel either, we want freedom and democracy, but this will not come easily. There will be very difficult days ahead, but Iran will get through this period. We will survive.&quot;</p><p>Some are hoping the strikes will bring people back on the streets in another show of mass protest that could ultimately bring down Iran&#39;s authoritarian government.</p><p>&quot;People are full of anger -- many thousands of people died in the protests and they are waiting like a wolf for an opportunity for revenge. This is their best chance,&quot; said Reza.</p><p>Nina, a young woman in her 30s from Tabriz, is also hoping the strikes will bring people back onto the streets.</p><p>&quot;If we don&#39;t manage to overthrow the regime now, there will once again be massacres,&quot; she warned.</p><p>Others are already looking to a future when the country will begin a transition to democracy -- with some putting their hopes in Reza Pahlavi, the exiled eldest son of Iran&#39;s last shah, who rose to prominence during the recent protests.</p><p>&quot;Every Iranian is ready: as soon as Prince Reza Pahlavi gives the order that we can return, we won&#39;t stay away a minute longer,&quot; said Amir Hossein, a singer from Tehran.</p><p>&quot;We will all come back to build a magnificent Iran.&quot;</p><p>bur-hmw/sbk</p></div></article></div>",

Saturday as campaigning kicked off for next month&#39;s presidential election in the oil-rich central African nation.</p><p>Thousands of supporters turned out to watch Sassou Nguesso parade in an open-topped convertible at&nbsp;a rally held by the president&#39;s Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the country&#39;s economic and oil capital Pointe-Noire, on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>Campaigning will end on March 13, with the first round of voting on March 15.</p><p>Six opposition candidates have formally confirmed they will be standing, including first-time 34-year-old candidate Destin Gavin, from the Republican Movement (MR).</p><p>But the fragmented and muzzled opposition stands little chance of winning, with the ruling party promising a &quot;wave&quot; in favour of its &quot;patriarch&quot;, according to roadside campaign posters.</p><p>&quot;Have no fear, on March 15, we will win!&quot; Sassou Nguesso told the rally, dressed in a white shirt adorned with an elephant.</p><p>The career military officer first led Congo under the one-party system from 1979 to 1992 before losing the country&#39;s first multi-party elections to former prime minister Pascal Lissouba.</p><p>He overthrew Lissouba in a civil war to return to power in 1997.</p><p>Earlier this month, he announced he would be seeking a new five-year term, which, according to the constitution, would be his last.</p><p>Sassou Nguesso is one of Africa&#39;s longest-ruling leaders after Paul Biya of Cameroon, who has been in office since 1982, and Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power in a 1979 coup.</p><p>He was the victor in 2002 and 2009 and was able to stand again -- and win -- in 2016 and 2021 after a constitutional change that removed the upper age limit of 70 and extended the maximum number of terms of office.</p><p>- Contested elections -</p><p>Congo-Brazzaville, a former French colony, is rich in oil but nearly half of its six million people live below the poverty line.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>While many of the young people bearing T-shirts with the president&#39;s likeness in the crowd at Saturday&#39;s rally in Pointe-Noire expressed confidence in Sassou Nguesso, some pointed to the country&#39;s economic worries.</p><p>&quot;We came here to support him, but the Congolese people are suffering. What we want is work,&quot; says Flora Kouka, a nurse.</p><p>At Saturday&#39;s rally, Sassou Nguesso touted his economic record all the same, pointing to the development of the roads, fossil fuel sector and farming, and conceded he would have to pass the baton at some point.</p><p>&quot;Our generation is laying the groundwork for the youth to pick up the torch one day,&quot; he said.</p><p>His political opponents have systematically contested all of his election victories since 2002.</p><p>Two candidates who ran in the 2016 elections -- General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko and Andre Okombi Salissa -- are still being held after convictions for &quot;attacking internal security&quot; in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>They had strongly disputed the official results, which gave Sassou Nguesso 60 percent of the vote.</p><p>NGOs and civil society groups regularly condemn violations of civil liberties and threats against political opponents.</p><p>The president is nonetheless reputed to have brought a degree of stability back to the country scarred by civil war in the 1990s and to a region plagued by conflict.</p><p>clt/phz/sbk/st</p></div></article></div>",

His event was already over. I’d asked his twin brother, Charlie, to check the meet schedule, and he’d given me the wrong time. I’d trusted an 11-year-old with something that was my responsibility as the adult.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Thomas had trained for months. Now he stood there, trying not to cry, while other kids celebrated. What hit hardest wasn’t just that Thomas missed his event. It was that I’d let both of my sons down. </span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/weekend-dad-gender-bias_l_684c86c6e4b070091d779af9?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Everyone Assumed I Was Just a Weekend Dad.

And both of those outcomes were on me.</span></p><p><span>That moment revealed a pattern I was reluctant to face. Even though I was divorced with 50/50 custody, I often treated parenting as a task I could delegate. I was trying too hard to be liked. I wanted to be the fun dad, not the firm one — and that meant avoiding some of the more mundane or difficult responsibilities. I kept acting like their friend when what my kids needed was a responsible adult.</span></p><p><span>What I was doing is known as being a “manchild,” a term used to describe men who avoid responsibility at home through procrastination, deflection or feigned ignorance. Men often say they are “just not good at multitasking” or that their partner is “better at organizing,” but the outcome is the same. <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emotional-fatigue-maternal-mental-load_l_6824f107e4b07f898ef476fb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:One person ends up doing the emotional and logistical heavy lifting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">One person ends up doing the emotional and logistical heavy lifting</a> while the other waits for direction.</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 354px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Some men don&#39;t realize the \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S.E4jy3cY1pzqj33UVtjMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b0b03b1d47b0105ee0d52ed743615a97><noscript><img alt=\"Some men don&#39;t realize the \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S.E4jy3cY1pzqj33UVtjMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b0b03b1d47b0105ee0d52ed743615a97 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Some men don't realize the \"manchild\" label matches their energy until there's conflict about it. <span class=\"copyright\">Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Shutterstock, Getty</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>This dynamic I experienced reflects a broader cultural conversation about men avoiding responsibility. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sabrina-carpenter-jokes-manchild-inspiration_uk_684af2f8e4b082ff4d074f54\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sabrina Carpenter’s viral summer hit “Manchild,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Sabrina Carpenter’s viral summer hit “Manchild,”</a> which has inspired dances, discourse and social media buzz, calls out grown men behaving like children.

Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Reena B. Patel</span></a><span>, is whether they get defensive when asked to take responsibility. </span></p><p><span>“That defensiveness is usually a sign that you know you’re not pulling your weight,” she said. Other warning signs include expecting partners to handle the majority of emotional labor and avoiding tasks until someone else steps in.</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-according-to-men_l_6880f2b9e4b0a3d10a1fbbf3?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;</a></strong></p><p><span>Scott said the first step is uncomfortable but simple: “Approach your partner and say, ‘I want to make sure I’m doing my part in managing our life together. Could we sit together and talk about something like the weekly schedule?’” The goal isn’t to take over but to participate with genuine interest.</span></p><p><span>Planning was Garcia’s breakthrough: “PLAN! I never used to plan anything. Now, if I don’t write it down or put it on my calendar, it won’t happen.”</span></p><p><span>Letting go of pride was the first hurdle Westerholtz had to face. </span></p><p><span>“Feeling useless at first” was the hardest part, he said. “Vulnerability isn’t something most men are trained in. I had to learn not to jump to fixing, but to actually be with pain or mess: my own and others’.”</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stepparent-toxic-comments_l_693c65afe4b018dc36f1ba4f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents</a></strong></p><p><span>Westerholtz now checks in weekly with his partner and uses a shared calendar with reminders like “pack lunch” and “doctor follow-up.” </span></p><p><span>“Visibility equals responsibility,” he said.</span></p><p><span>These changes have brought broader impacts. “There’s less resentment. More tenderness. My partner doesn’t have to mother me, and that makes space for partnership,” Westerholtz said. </span></p><p><span>The change has also shaped how their son understands masculinity<em>:</em></span><span>&nbsp;“I also see my son learning not just how to survive, but how to be a man who feels, apologizes, and holds others with care.”</span></p><p><span>Consistency became the turning point in Garcia’s relationship with his daughter, but it required moving beyond traditional activities. </span></p><p><span>“Being intentional with our time, and not just taking her to dinners or baseball games, but getting to know her personally, has built a relationship between us that is indescribable,” Garcia said. When Garcia volunteered as a <a href=\"https://dadsofgreatstudents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students)</a>, seeing his daughter light up when he showed up for lunch made her feel supported at school and among friends.</span></p><h2><strong>What Kind Of Man Do You Want To Be?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>These fathers are consciously breaking generational patterns. For Westerholtz, this transformation meant redefining what it means to be a man for his son. “Before, I think I believed being a man meant protecting, fixing and staying strong. Now I think it’s about being present, especially when things are messy.” </span></p><p><span>He tells his son it’s OK to feel scared or sad, and that real strength means talking about emotions instead of shutting down: “We talk about emotions like weather. They pass, but you don’t need to pretend it’s sunny when it’s not.”</span></p><p><span>This shift in emotional openness extends beyond family. In his male friendships, Westerholtz brings the same vulnerability. “It used to be all banter and distraction, surface-level. But when I started being real about how hard things were with my son’s health, I found that most men were relieved. Like they’d been waiting for someone to go first.” As he puts it: “Vulnerability invites connection, not just with our partners, but with our mates too.”</span></p><p><span>Patel notes that children benefit directly when fathers develop emotional maturity. “They model respect, empathy and resilience skills that their children will carry into adulthood. Partners also feel more supported, less stressed and free to be individuals, not caretakers for another adult.”</span></p><p><span>The ‘manchild’ label stings because it highlights a gap between how men see themselves and how they actually show up. Like Garcia and Westerholtz, I’m learning to show up differently for my sons. I need to be a father who is sometimes a friend, not a friend who is sometimes a father. That track meet taught me the hard way. Now, I check every appointment, every schedule, every exam and essay due date. Nothing has been missed since. </span></p><p><span>My sons are 18 now, and my habit of double-checking everything still annoys them. But I would rather that than let them down again.</span></p><p><span>As Westerholtz put it: “You’re not less of a man for softening. You’re just becoming less of a boy.”</span></p><p><strong><em>The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.</em></strong></p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dads-anger-coping-advice_l_686d40a1e4b088c62569aacc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sabrina-carpenter-album-artwork-backlash_n_684af224e4b0f2259d6120d7?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mankeeping-dating-emotional-labor-research_l_682f3305e4b0ef574bf5e553?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-grown-up-goog_l_69a07223e4b0b62154a85d2e?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

on Iran by Israel and the United States will impact energy prices and affect countries far from the conflict, like Singapore, said Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p><p>Speaking at&nbsp;a Chinese New Year dinner at Teck Ghee Community Club on Feb 28, SM Lee&nbsp;said the&nbsp;attack&nbsp;contributes to an uncertain global climate that will in turn affect trade and investment.</p><p>He noted that tensions between the US and Iran have been building for weeks, and that America had assembled a huge military force in the Middle East, including <a

attacked Iran jointly,” SM Lee said. “The war has begun. Iran has struck back – cities, targets across the Middle East, Israel itself, Doha, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE.”</p><p>Noting the potential impact of the war, he said: “You can see when the war will start. It is very hard to tell how the war will end.”</p><p>SM Lee said that in an uncertain world,&nbsp;Singapore cannot take its good economic performance in the previous year for granted.</p><p>He noted&nbsp;that it had done better than expected with<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singapore-upgrades-2026-economic-growth-forecast-to-2-4-after-outperforming-in-2025\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a gross domestic product growth of 5 per cent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> a gross domestic product growth of 5 per cent</a>, and an increase in wages and lower inflation.</p><p>And while he hoped Singapore will continue to do well in 2026, it is unclear what&nbsp;new surprises are in store.</p><p>The attack on Feb 28 follows a&nbsp;12-day air war in June 2025 between Israel and Iran and&nbsp;repeated US-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p><p>During that time, the&nbsp;US had also <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/us-airstrikes-failed-to-destroy-irans-nuclear-sites-sources-say\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:struck three Iranian nuclear sites;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">struck three Iranian nuclear sites</a>, with the attack producing conflicting reports over the extent&nbsp;of&nbsp;damage&nbsp;done&nbsp;to Iran’s nuclear capabilities.</p><p>On the global economic front, SM Lee highlighted <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singapore-to-seek-clarity-from-us-counterparts-on-implementation-of-trumps-new-15-tariff\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:US President Donald Trump’s new global tariffs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">US President Donald Trump’s new global tariffs</a>&nbsp;that came as a response to the Supreme Court ruling on Feb 20 that most of the duties imposed by the US administration in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-tariffs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:were illegal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">were illegal</a>.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>SM Lee said that while the US administration had responded to the ruling by immediately invoking another law to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trumps-10-per-cent-global-levy-takes-effect-as-us-rebuilds-tariff-wall\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:impose a flat 10 per cent tariff;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">impose a flat 10 per cent tariff</a> on all countries, Mr Trump changed his mind within a day and raised it to 15 per cent.</p><p>SM Lee said:&nbsp;“We watched with concern. But so far, the official US tariff rate is still 10 per cent. So we are relieved, but I think we have to watch very carefully.”</p><p>The overall climate of uncertainty created by these dramatic twists and turns will dampen the global climate for trade and investment, and for cooperation and prosperity,&nbsp;he added.</p><p>He said: “Because businesses and companies will find it impossible to plan for what will happen tomorrow, what they can rely on, where they can safely invest, what they should do in order to make sure that the company will be okay day after tomorrow. “And this is going to affect us too, as a small and open economy reliant on global trade and investments.”</p><p>He said&nbsp;that under&nbsp;such conditions, the Government will do its part to help Singaporeans, but also urged them to upgrade themselves with new skills.</p><p>SM Lee said&nbsp;Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Feb 12 had unveiled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2026-lays-groundwork-to-refresh-singapores-strategies-for-a-more-uncertain-world-pm-wong\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Budget 2026;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Budget 2026</a>&nbsp;with help for businesses, workers, the elderly and vulnerable, and households, to cope with cost-of-living concerns.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong meeting residents at the Chinese New Year dinner at Teck Ghee Community Club on Feb 28.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RQoe1NRPfY3myEzKZnxwxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/7d3186169492c7d4de57fedb22fefef4><noscript><img alt=\"Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong meeting residents at the Chinese New Year dinner at Teck Ghee Community Club on Feb 28.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RQoe1NRPfY3myEzKZnxwxw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/7d3186169492c7d4de57fedb22fefef4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong meeting residents at the Chinese New Year dinner at Teck Ghee Community Club on Feb 28.</figcaption></div></figure><p>SM Lee&nbsp;highlighted schemes including the Cost-of-Living Special Payment of between $200&nbsp;and&nbsp;$400 for all adult Singaporeans, the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2026-500-cdc-vouchers-for-all-singaporean-households-in-jan-2027\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:$500 in CDC vouchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">$500 in CDC vouchers</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;every household next January, and more generous U-Save rebates&nbsp;to help with&nbsp;utilities expenses.</p><p>“Most households will receive some form of financial help almost every month – whether it’s U-Save or S&amp;CC (service and conservancy charges) rebates, whether it’s CPF top-ups, LifeSG credits, CDC vouchers or cash,” he said.</p><p>He also noted how the Government&nbsp;is investing in strengthening&nbsp;the economy, especially to encourage and support Singaporean workers in learning how to use artificial intelligence.</p><p>The new moves announced by PM Wong&nbsp;include&nbsp;the expansion of the Enterprise Innovation Scheme to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/ai-emerges-as-cornerstone-of-singapores-new-economic-playbook\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:support businesses in their adoption of AI,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">support businesses in their adoption of AI,</a> and free subscription to AI tools for Singaporeans taking up selected AI training courses.</p><p>SM Lee urged Singaporeans to play their part too, to continue to learn new skills like AI.</p><p>He said: “Our companies have to upgrade themselves, reinvent and transform their businesses to stay competitive.</p><p>“And I hope everyone makes full use of the support you are getting through our various programmes, and work together to take advantage of these opportunities and overcome the challenges ahead of us to build a brighter future for ourselves.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/israel-us-attack-on-iran-will-affect-energy-prices-impact-countries-far-away-like-singapore-sm-lee?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

He lived next door to Epstein in New York City, and the Justice Department’s files revealed he visited Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St. James, even though he’d previously said he’d cut ties with Epstein in 2005, before he was first charged with crimes for prostituting minors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lutnick remains in office despite calls from Democrats and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), for his resignation. But Comer has said he’d be interested in hauling Lutnick before his committee. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), a member of the panel, said this week she’d vote for a subpoena, and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), another committee member, said he believes there’d be enough votes to authorize one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We’re going to continue to ask questions of everyone that shows up in photos on the island and things like that,” Comer said Friday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is still amping up the MAGA faithful on his podcast despite his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:extensive communications and scheming;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">extensive communications and scheming</a> with Epstein.

Without any meaningful sense of itself as an independent branch, the Republican Congress has embraced extreme partisanship and shunted oversight of the administration. The House Oversight Committee interviewed Hillary Clinton, who did not know Epstein and never communicated with him, partly to find out why Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell had been a guest at her daughter’s wedding (she was an invited guest’s plus-one, Clinton said). Trump and first lady Melania Trump were both close friends with Epstein and Maxwell.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kansas-anti-trans-drivers-license_n_69a1fc59e4b03f5cc1b3f981?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Red State Residents In Chaos After Lawmakers Yank Their Driver's Licenses, Birth Certificates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Red State Residents In Chaos After Lawmakers Yank Their Driver's Licenses, Birth Certificates</a></strong></p><p><span>Second, Trump ended the independence of the Department of Justice, meaning that it won’t undertake any investigations without his approval. This corruption of federal law enforcement, enabled by the Supreme Court’s Trump v. U.S. decision, removes yet another lever of oversight and accountability.</span></p><p><span>Third, MAGA is not interested in accountability for Republicans generally. Trump has granted pardons to campaign donors and fraudsters, not to mention more than a thousand rioters, without any pushback. Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) maintains the nominal support of party leadership even though he had an affair with a staffer who later killed herself.</span></p><p><span>All of these are downstream from the final and most important reason: no one in Trump world is more connected to Epstein here than Trump. He was Epstein’s “</span><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/fire-and-fury-the-podcast/epstein-from-beyond-the-grave\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:closest friend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>closest friend</span></a><span>” for 10 years, according to Epstein.

And whereas the US strikes in June were over within a few hours, sources have told CNN that the US military is this time planning for several days of attacks.</p><p>In response, the Iranian regime has launched an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, with blasts heard in several countries that host US military bases, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the first few hours of what could be a longer regional war.</p><h3>What did Trump say?</h3><p>In his 2.30 a.m. statement, Trump said the objective of the US operation – which the Department of Defense is calling <a href=\"https://cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm62o5yv0000356r8a0i946l&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:“Operation Epic Fury”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">“Operation Epic Fury”</a> – is “to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”</p><p>The president listed the Iranian regime’s long history of sponsoring terror in the region and hostility toward the US, from the 1979 hostage crisis to the more recent actions of its proxies.</p><p>“For 47 years the Iranian regime has chanted “death to America” and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops, and the innocent people in many, many countries,” Trump said. “It’s been mass terror. And we’re not going to put up with it any longer.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QNnuLQqf1R7KcORqogt6lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3167b742d67966a4e873cbef04243b16><noscript><img alt=\"People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QNnuLQqf1R7KcORqogt6lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3167b742d67966a4e873cbef04243b16 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Why is the US launching military action?</h3><p>Trump said Iran had “rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions,” which had prompted the US to take military action.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The strikes come just hours after Oman’s foreign minister, who has been mediating the talks between US and Iranian officials, said the two sides had made “significant progress” during the latest round of negotiations.</p><p>Trump also claimed that Iran’s ballistic missile program could threaten America’s security. He said the US would “destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.” He also claimed the US will “annihilate” Iran’s navy.</p><h3>What did Trump say to the Iranian people?</h3><p>At the end of his video, Trump called on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the elite wing of the regime’s military, to lay down its arms and enjoy “complete immunity,” or “face certain death.” Since the US attacks have been from the air, rather than the ground, it was not clear to whom the IRGC would surrender.</p><p>He also addressed the Iranian people directly, saying: “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations. For many years you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want.

Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday, with Israel&#39;s public broadcaster reporting that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been targeted, as the Islamic republic retaliated with barrages of missiles at Gulf states and Israel.</p><p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards, the ideological arm of the Islamic republic, said they had targeted the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, other American interests in the Gulf and Israel.</p><p>Iran&#39;s regionwide missile salvo could be heard in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE, as well as Israel and Iraq, in the hours following the first strikes, after it had repeatedly vowed to retaliate fiercely should it be attacked.</p><p>A strike on a school in Iran killed 24 people, an Iranian provincial official said, while in Israel the army deployed search and rescue teams to multiple locations following reports of fallen projectiles.</p><p>In the UAE, the defence ministry said Iranian strikes had killed one civilian, and witnesses in Dubai heard an explosion and saw missiles streak across the sky.</p><p>Smoke was rising over Tehran&#39;s Pasteur district, site of the home of Khamenei, and there was a huge security deployment in the capital.</p><p>&quot;Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were among the targets of the attack,&quot; Israel&#39;s Kan reported, citing an Israeli source.</p><p>Iranian state television said Pezeshkian was &quot;safe and sound&quot;, while the Fars news agency said &quot;missile impacts were reported in the Keshvardoost and Pasteur districts&quot; of Tehran.</p><p>Witnesses told AFP correspondents they had heard at least three blasts in the area. AFP journalists also saw long lines of people queueing at bakeries at various locations in Tehran.</p><p>The attacks came after US President Donald Trump expressed frustration at Iran&#39;s stance in negotiations over its nuclear and missile programmes.</p><p>Trump said Washington&#39;s goal was &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot; from Iran, and Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation was to remove an &quot;existential threat&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;The United States&#39; military began major combat operations in Iran,&quot; Trump said in a video message posted on his social media site while he spent the weekend at his Florida golf club.</p><p>- Totally &#39;obliterated&#39; -</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground.

Trump appears hopeful his major air operation can successfully result in a change in Iran’s regime, despite the vast uncertainties about what might replace it and the limited historical examples of air power alone ousting a country’s leader.</p><p>“They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” said Trump, who a US official said is continuing to monitor the strikes from Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The president reached his decision after weeks of deliberation and an attempt by his envoys to strike a rapid diplomatic agreement that would have forced Iran to abandon long-held red lines. The US military is planning for several days of attacks, two sources told CNN, and Iran has already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm659xol00013b6pvcmz6t8r&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:retaliated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">retaliated</a> across the Middle East, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm64h9ax00003b6rj3zp8g0k&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:targeting the US Navy base in Bahrain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">targeting the US Navy base in Bahrain</a> that is home to the Fifth Fleet, a US official said.</p><p>Trump never fully publicly laid out his case for war, even during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, despite strikes being a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/politics/donald-trump-dilemma-iran?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:politically perilous move;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">politically perilous move</a> at home, especially for a president who campaigned on ending foreign entanglements. He noted on Saturday the potential cost to American lives.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“The Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties — that often happens in war — but we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission,” the president said, adding that US had “taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region.”</p><p>To many of Trump’s allies, military action had long appeared inevitable. After telling Iranian protesters at the start of the year that he would come to their support, warning the US was “locked and loaded” to attack, he felt obligated to enforce his red line.</p><p>“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump told the Iranian people in his video.</p><p>“For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s motivations for his second set of strikes within Iran since returning to office — conveyed mostly in curt, off-hand public remarks — appeared to shift over time, moving from protecting protesters to curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions to ousting the Iranian regime. He’s also cited Iran’s arsenal of missiles and destabilizing support for regional proxy groups, like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p><p>How the latest military action from both the US and Israel advances all, or any, of those objectives remains to be seen. Nor was it clear what the president has been told to expect in the aftermath.</p><p>Behind the scenes ahead of the strikes, officials wrestled with a slate of imperfect options that all stopped short of a decisive mission like the one Trump ordered in January to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas. US intelligence is uncertain on who would replace Iran’s senior leaders if they are taken out.</p><p>Military officials have also warned the president about the steep risks for retaliation. Thousands of American troops based in the Middle East could now potentially be targets for Iran as it carries out promised reprisals.</p><p>During intense Situation Room meetings over the last several weeks, Trump and senior officials peppered top Pentagon brass, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/caine-iran-hegseth-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gen. Dan Caine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gen. Dan Caine</a>, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with questions about each options’ likelihood of success. The answers were often inconclusive, even as Trump ordered a massive military buildup in the Middle East.</p><p>In his vague public remarks leading up to the strikes, Trump issued threats <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/27/politics/iran-missiles-trump-intelligence-nuclear?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not backed by US intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not backed by US intelligence</a> — including that Iran would soon have a missile that can hit the US.</p><p>“They should make a deal, but they don’t want to quite go far enough,” he said Friday during a stop in Texas. “They don’t want to say the key words: ‘We’re not going to have a nuclear weapon.’”</p><p>Yet if Iran’s words alone were the bar for avoiding conflict, the hurdle had already been cleared. The country has repeatedly said it is not pursuing nuclear weapons, including this week.</p><p>There are many reasons to question that claim, including Iran’s previous enrichment of uranium to near-weapons grade. But Trump’s emphasis on the country’s words alone only seemed to raise more questions about what, precisely, he was looking for in a deal with the country’s leaders.</p><p>He allowed diplomacy to proceed, despite warnings from some senior officials that Iran was notoriously difficult to negotiate with. Some questioned whether Iran’s Supreme Leader, who has ultimate sign-off, would agree to any of Trump’s terms — even if his negotiators seemed more willing to negotiate.</p><p>Many inside Trump’s orbit encouraged him to pursue a deal. His envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who engaged in three rounds of indirect talks with the Iranians, entered the discussions with guarded hopes for success.</p><p>But others were less encouraging. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham publicly scoffed at some reported concessions offered by the Iranians. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an urgent visit to Washington this month, said there would unlikely be a more opportune moment to strike Iran.</p><p>Throughout, Trump had appeared to people around him wary of taking the country to war, far preferring a diplomatic outcome that he could sell as stronger than the Obama-era nuclear deal he withdrew from. But he was impatient for an agreement, setting short timelines that did not yield the concessions he was seeking from Tehran.</p><p>In ordering the strikes, Trump overcame certain misgivings at launching an operation his military advisers warned could have an uncertain outcome and could prompt outsized retaliation by Tehran.</p><p>And the new operation — which follows limited US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last June — poses significant political risk for a president whose base has opposed foreign wars. In all, Trump has used the US military to target sites in more than than a half-dozen countries in his second term. It’s not clear how long this operation may last or cost, either in terms of money or lives.</p><p>In an interview this week, Vice President JD Vance — who has previously warned about sending US troops into harm’s way for uncertain purposes — suggested any operation in Iran would not result in a prolonged conflict akin to the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p><p>“I do think we have to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. I also think that we have to avoid overlearning the lessons of the past,” he told the Washington Post. “Just because one president screwed up a military conflict doesn’t mean we can never engage in military conflict again. We’ve got to be careful about it, but I think the president is being careful.”</p><p>Trump acknowledged the risk of a prolonged conflict in his own assessment on Friday. “I guess you could say there’s always a risk. You know, when there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

who are lawfully in the US from being arrested and deported, saying a Trump administration policy turns the “American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”</p><p>US District Judge John Tunheim granted a motion by advocates for refugees to convert a temporary restraining order that he issued in January into a more permanent preliminary injunction while the case develops further.</p><p>The order applies only in Minnesota. But the implications of a new national policy on refugees that the Department of Homeland Security announced February 18 were a major part of the discussion at a hearing held by the judge the next day.</p><p>“Minnesota refugees can now live their lives without fear that their own government will snatch them off the street and imprison them far from loved ones,” Kimberly Grano, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told The Associated Press.</p><p>The Trump administration asserts it has the right to arrest potentially tens of thousands of refugees across the US who entered the country legally but don’t yet have green cards. A new Homeland Security memo interprets immigration law to say that refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. so that their applications can be reviewed.</p><p>The judge, however, expressed disbelief in a 66-page opinion.</p><p>“This Court will not allow federal authorities to use a new and erroneous statutory interpretation to terrorize refugees who immigrated to this country under the promise that they would be welcomed and allowed to live in peace, far from the persecution they fled,” Tunheim said.</p><p>He said the US decades ago promised refugees fleeing persecution that they could build a new life after rigorous background checks.</p><p>“We promised them the hope that one day they could achieve the American Dream,” Tunheim said. “The Government’s new policy breaks that promise — without congressional authorization — and raises serious constitutional concerns. The new policy turns the refugees’ American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Homeland Security and US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement Friday night that the ruling was “yet another lawless and activist order from a federal judge” and that the Trump administration expected to be “vindicated in court.”</p><p>“USCIS is committed to rooting out fraud and protecting the public safety and national security interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens,” the statement said.</p><p>Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during a court hearing last week that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but he also indicated that would not always happen.</p><p>The judge noted that one refugee in the case, identified as D. Doe, was arrested in January after being told that someone had struck his car.</p><p>“He was immediately flown to Texas, where he was interrogated about his refugee status. He was kept in ‘shackles and handcuffs’ for sixteen hours. D. Doe was ultimately released on the streets of Texas, left to find his way back to Minnesota,” Tunheim said.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
