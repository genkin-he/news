used false pretenses to enter a campus residential building – has been released, she confirmed on her Instagram account.</p><p>At approximately 6:30 a.m., agents from the Department of Homeland Security entered a Columbia residential building in New York City and took a student into custody, Columbia University’s Acting President Claire Shipman said <a

federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a ‘missing person,’” Shipman wrote. “We are working to gather more details.”</p><p>The student has been identified as Aghayeva, an international student and senior double majoring in neuroscience and political science, according to the American Association of University Professors, which confirmed her identity to CNN. AAUP learned of Aghayeva’s identity when her fellow students alerted the Columbia University AAUP chapter.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ellie Aghayeva, a Columbia University senior, was detained by federal agents on Thursday. - ellharve/Instagram\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Bf4cm5uFKL5mK1Kj2mKCWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4f78ac0f56724d8d9d4258b23af9034d><noscript><img alt=\"Ellie Aghayeva, a Columbia University senior, was detained by federal agents on Thursday. - ellharve/Instagram\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Bf4cm5uFKL5mK1Kj2mKCWA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4f78ac0f56724d8d9d4258b23af9034d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ellie Aghayeva, a Columbia University senior, was detained by federal agents on Thursday. - ellharve/Instagram</figcaption></div></figure><p>The Department of Homeland Security initially confirmed to CNN that ICE arrested Aghayeva, but did not respond to allegations that agents misrepresented themselves to gain access to the building.</p><p>ICE arrested Aghayeva, who is from Azerbaijan, “whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes,” the statement read.</p><p>“The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.

26, 2026. - George Walker IV/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>A federal prosecutor in Nashville who secured criminal charges last year against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national who was illegally deported by the Trump administration, attempted to convince a federal judge on Thursday to not toss out the case based on a finding that it was likely vindictively pursued.</p><p>The high-stakes hearing was the latest flashpoint in a sprawling web of court cases Abrego Garcia has been ensnared in since his hasty deportation last March to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador and the administration’s initial reluctance to bring him back came to symbolize President Donald Trump’s slapdash and contentious approach to immigration enforcement.</p><p>But the criminal case Abrego Garcia was brought back to the US to face last year has essentially been on life-support in recent months after US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found evidence of a “realistic likelihood” that he’s the target of a vindictive prosecution that was pursued, in part, by high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington, DC.</p><p>Over several hours of testimony before Crenshaw on Thursday, Robert McGuire, who is leading the prosecution, repeatedly stressed that department leaders in Washington played no role in bringing the pair of human smuggling charges against Abrego Garcia and that he was the one calling all the shots in the matter.</p><p>“Who made the decision to seek an indictment of Mr. Abrego?” Associate Attorney General Stan Woodward asked McGuire at one point.</p><p>“I did,” McGuire replied, adding that nobody at the Department of Justice’s headquarters asked him to pursue the charges.</p><p>“The charging decision – that was my decision,” McGuire said. “I wanted to feel good about it on my own.”</p><p>That Thursday’s hearing happened at all is a remarkable turn of events in a criminal case that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373969491112\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:once described as “strong.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">once described as “strong.”</a> The department had for months tried to avoid being put in the awkward position of having to defend its prosecution of Abrego Garcia but amid the legal wrangling, it’s been forced to turn over some internal communications that appeared to undermine the assertions made by McGuire last year and again on Thursday.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The integrity of the case has come under serious doubt by Crenshaw in recent months as he’s assessed Abrego Garcia’s claim that he’s being prosecuted in retaliation for successfully challenging his wrongful deportation, concluding that the Maryland father of three has shown evidence of a “realistic likelihood” that he’s the target of a vindictive prosecution. That determination could soon lead him to throw out the case.</p><p>Requests by criminal defendants for judges to toss out charges based on their claim that they’re being vindictively prosecuted face extremely high hurdles in court and are overwhelmingly unsuccessful because of how difficult it can be to connect prosecutors’ decisions to a retaliatory motive.</p><p>McGuire on Thursday tried to brush aside any notion that such a connection exists in Abrego Garcia’s case. He said communications he had last spring about the case with an official working under Blanche were only meant to keep his office abreast of key developments in his pursuit of charges.</p><p>“I wasn’t asking Mr. Singh’s permission or asking him to buy in on it,” he said, referring to Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh, who oversees dozens of US attorneys around the country.</p><p>But those comments could do little to sway Crenshaw, who said in a major ruling last year that a trove of internal documents “suggest” the prosecutor worked with department officials in Washington, “who may or may not have acted with an improper motivation.” The judge specifically pointed to Singh, saying he played a “leading role” in prosecutorial decisions in the case.</p><p>“The court said (Singh) played a leading role. That’s just not true,” said McGuire, who now serves as a top-ranking prosecutor in the office.</p><p>McGuire also insisted that Abrego Garcia’s case was similar to other human smuggling cases he’d handled in the past. He said that after reviewing an officer’s body camera footage from a 2022 Tennessee interstate highway traffic stop the charges stem from, “I was immediately struck by how similar what was being depicted in the body cam was to those other” human smuggling cases.</p><p>But, he added, he wouldn’t have pursued charges based on the footage alone. Other evidence gathered before charges were sought bolstered his decision to ask a grand jury last May to approve the two counts.</p><p>“There were a lot of things that told me … ‘OK, this really looks like a human smuggling operation,’” he said.</p><h3>Case on shaky ground</h3><p>Two key decisions last year by Crenshaw revealed the shaky ground the case was on. The appointee of former President Barack Obama said that the burden is on the government to fend off a presumption that officials only reopened a yearsold probe into Abrego Garcia, and subsequently asked a grand jury to approve charges, to punish him for filing a lawsuit challenging his deportation.</p><p>“The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego’s success in the Maryland lawsuit and deterring any future efforts in that lawsuit,” Crenshaw wrote in his first ruling in October.</p><p>In that decision, the judge carefully laid out key moments leading up to Abrego Garcia’s indictment that appeared to support his claim that officials only reopened their investigation into him in response to his winning streak in the deportation case. He specifically called out public statements made by Blanche on the day Abrego Garcia was arrested that “directly linked the Maryland lawsuit to the investigation of criminal behavior by Abrego.”</p><p>“At minimum, this suggests the (administration’s) frustration with Abrego, and that his case was not a run-of-the-mill prosecution,” he wrote. “Even assuming the individual motive of Acting US Attorney McGuire was pure, others’ motives, like fruit from a poisonous tree, may taint this prosecution.”</p><p>Two months later, Crenshaw made public excerpts of several emails between McGuire and Singh in which Singh said prosecuting Abrego Garcia is a “top priority” for the department and subsequent messages that showed McGuire providing updates and draft charging documents to Singh as he moved toward asking a grand jury to approve the charges.</p><p>Under questioning from David Patton, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, McGuire said he didn’t know whether Singh was sharing information from their conversations with Blanche, Attorney General Pam Bondi or other Trump administration officials.</p><p>“Nothing happened that came back to me,” he testified.</p><p>That the government decided against calling Singh or Blanche as witnesses at the hearing could prove consequential since the judge has already signaled dissatisfaction with the representations made by McGuire about the charging decisions.</p><p>But if Crenshaw decides that the testimony provided Thursday is enough to refute his preliminary finding from last year, it’ll set up another round of court proceedings in which he’ll have to resolve a request from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers for him to summon Blanche and Singh to Nashville to testify at yet another hearing.</p><p>McGuire has previously argued that even if others in the administration “have alleged ill will” toward Abrego Garcia, “there is nothing before the court to establish that such alleged ill will actually motivated the prosecution.”</p><p>He said in a sworn statement last September that he “never received any direction” from officials at DOJ headquarters “that was unethical or inappropriate” and that choosing to charge Abrego Garcia “was the correct legal decision.”</p><p>Also on the witness stand Thursday was Rana Saoud, a former agent with the Department of Homeland Security’s investigatory office in Nashville, who similarly testified that her decision to reopen a yearsold probe into Abrego Garcia was not the result of any undue influence from officials in Washington.</p><p>Saoud said she first learned about the 2022 traffic stop that the investigation – and criminal charges – stems from after someone sent her a local news article about it and that Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit challenging his deportation “had nothing to do with it at all.”</p><p>“We’re not swayed by political posturing,” she said, adding later that at the time, she wouldn’t have talked to any leaders at the department, including Secretary Kristi Noem, about the newly reopened probe.</p><p>“That is well above my level,” she said.</p><h3>Rare hearing</h3><p>Legal experts said that Crenshaw’s earlier rulings have put the government on notice that the case is quickly unraveling.</p><p>“It is exceedingly rare that, as here, the evidence triggers the presumption of a vindictive prosecution that the government must rebut. This puts the government’s counsel on their heels,” said retired federal Judge John Jones.</p><p>“The government’s witnesses are going to have to try to explain away a determination to prosecute Abrego Garcia that came from Main Justice and only after he was released,” Jones added. “From the defense’s standpoint, this is a lawyer’s dream.”</p><p>Abrego Garcia has been on pre-trial release in Maryland and is simultaneously fighting off efforts by the administration to re-deport him, this time to a country other than El Salvador. He attended Thursday’s hearing, but sat silently in the well of the courtroom as the two witnesses took the stand, following their testimony with the help of interpreters.</p><p>His initial deportation to that country, which he is from, violated a 2019 court order that expressly prohibited officials from sending him back because he feared gang violence there.</p><p>After a federal judge in Maryland said the government needed to work to “facilitate” his return, officials resisted complying with her order for months, but eventually partnered with El Salvador to return him in early June. He was arrested on the human smuggling charges when he returned to American soil.</p><p>Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the pair of charges, which stem from the 2022 stop that was the subject of a federal investigation that closed days before he was deported last March.</p><p>Prosecutors elected to not bring charges following the stop, but in the indictment secured last year, they alleged that the nine Hispanic male passengers who were in the car with Abrego Garcia were being smuggled as part of a yearslong international smuggling ring that he was involved in.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defiantly faced lawmakers Thursday who sought to question her about her family’s past ties to Jeffrey Epstein, insisting that she had no information about the late convicted sex offender’s criminal activities and blasting Republicans for what she termed a faux effort at transparency.</p><p>Clinton insisted in sworn testimony before the House Oversight Committee that she could not recall meeting Epstein, had no knowledge of his crimes and only interacted with a convicted accomplice of his, Ghislaine Maxwell, a handful of times, according to her opening statement and accounts from those in the room. She and other Democrats criticized Republicans, asking why they had not questioned others with ties to Epstein, including President Donald Trump.</p><p>“You have held zero public hearings, refused to allow the media to attend them, including today, despite espousing the need for transparency on dozens of occasions,” Clinton said in her opening statement, which she delivered behind closed doors but also posted publicly.</p><p>The deposition – which took place in New York, near where she lives with former President Bill Clinton, over the course of about six-and-a-half hours – is one of the highest-profile interviews yet in the Republican-led committee’s investigation into Epstein. It comes after both Clintons vigorously resisted testifying in what they denounced as a Republican plot against them, only to reverse course when faced with the prospect of being held in criminal contempt of Congress. Bill Clinton is set to testify Friday.</p><p>By midday, the deposition had already devolved into a rancorous partisan affair. The proceedings had to be paused briefly after conservative podcaster Benny Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027067846417690630?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:posted a photo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">posted a photo</a> from the ongoing interview on X – which Democrats asserted was a violation of House rules. The image, Johnson said, was provided by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert.</p><p>“I admired her blue suit,” the congresswoman quipped to reporters during a break in the proceeding.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Speaking to reporters during that break, Democrats blasted Republicans over the episode and called for members of the media to be allowed in the deposition room.</p><p>“We are sitting through an incredibly unserious clown show of a deposition where members of Congress and the Republican Party are more concerned about getting their photo op of Secretary Clinton than actually getting to the truth and holding anyone accountable,” Arizona Democratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari said.</p><p>While the deposition was not conducted publicly, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he would try to release video of it within the next 24 hours. The Kentucky Republican said the discussion was “productive” and that he “learned a lot,” but that Hillary Clinton frequently referred questions to her husband, saying, “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask my husband” more than a dozen times.</p><p>“We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow,” Comer said.</p><p>Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said Clinton was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee, and is answering questions in full faith and in good faith.” He declined to provide specifics, imploring Republicans to quickly release the full video of the deposition.</p><p>In her opening statement, Clinton sought to make clear she knew nothing of Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>“The Committee justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Let me be as clear as i can. I do not,” Clinton said in the prepared remarks. “I had no idea about their criminal activities. I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes or offices. I have nothing to add to that.”</p><p>Republicans have insisted the Clintons’ testimony is vital to their probe, and noted that neither Bill nor Hillary have answered detailed inquiries about their ties to Epstein.</p><p>“It is a bipartisan investigation. The American people have a lot of questions. To my knowledge, the Clintons haven’t answered very many if any questions about their knowledge or involvement with Epstein and Maxwell,” Comer said.</p><p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said at a press briefing after the deposition that Clinton “took every question from every single member.” During the interview, she asked Clinton a number of questions about her husband, including whether the former first lady had any feelings about young women massaging him, according to a source who watched the deposition. Clinton responded she would not speculate about events for which she was not present and was not there to discuss feelings.</p><p>Bill Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and a spokesperson has repeatedly said he cut ties before Epstein’s arrest on federal charges in 2019 and was unaware of any crimes.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8DblPGG6zoeTH.688Fqixw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2d1c4610d6e1634619522e50638c7415><noscript><img alt=\"House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8DblPGG6zoeTH.688Fqixw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2d1c4610d6e1634619522e50638c7415 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>A CNN review showed the former president traveled on Epstein’s private plane at least 16 times, and he was pictured in Epstein case files released by the Justice Department with women in a jacuzzi, as well as with Maxwell.</p><p>Hillary Clinton was accompanied Thursday by her attorneys, who have been working through painstaking details of what areas could be covered during questioning.</p><p>Even the location for the depositions, the Clintons’ hometown of Chappaqua, was negotiated between Clinton lawyer David Kendall and Comer in hopes of avoiding the indignity and precedent-setting move of summoning a former president to Capitol Hill for questioning.</p><p>The former first lady arrived out of direct sight of the gaggle of reporters who had gathered in front of the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Almost a year after China expanded rare-earth export controls ostensibly aimed at preventing their use by foreign militaries, exporters are still asking a basic question: when does a small magnet turn an everyday product into a controlled item?</p><p>Makers of products ranging from pill boxes, printed billboards, motor components and optical glass are among the growing number of companies that have queried the ‌commerce ministry over whether they require export licences.</p><p>Beijing is expanding export enforcement manpower and imposing compliance nationwide, even as it raises costs for domestic firms and makes it harder for them to ship goods.</p><p>A Reuters ‌review of over 200 public export-control compliance enquiries to China&#39;s commerce ministry between 2019 and the start of this month showed a stark surge after rare-earth controls were tightened last April.</p><p>In the meantime, Washington has eased some export restrictions on products like advanced artificial-intelligence chips during President Donald Trump&#39;s second ​term, after China&#39;s curbs on rare earths exports threatened to hobble global supply chains spanning autos, technology, energy, aerospace, and defence.</p><p>The export controls on both sides are expected to be in sharp focus as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Beijing in late March for their second in-person talks since Trump returned to office, setting up a high-stakes test of whether a fragile trade truce between the world&#39;s two largest economies can hold.</p><p>&quot;What we are seeing in China is ... the rapid construction of a comprehensive export-control apparatus designed to weaponize chokepoints across strategic and non-strategic sectors,&quot; said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a Beijing-based managing director at Ankura Consulting. &quot;That the U.S. is reining in some of its controls is a direct acknowledgement of China&#39;s growing leverage.&quot;</p><p>China&#39;s commerce ministry ‌did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>EXPORT COMPLIANCE QUERIES JUMP</p><p>Exporters have flooded the ⁠Chinese commerce ministry&#39;s website with urgent compliance questions: whether magnetic sheets cross rare-earth thresholds; whether gallium nitride chips are restricted; whether ultraviolet medical equipment counts as controlled technology.</p><p>From 2019 through 2024, only 43 export-control compliance enquiries were posted publicly. In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory ⁠burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p><p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government&#39;s commerce ministry.</p><p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p><p>The enforcement push is also legal ​and ​bureaucratic. Since China enacted its Export Control Law in October 2020, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared ​to just six times between 2015-2020.</p><p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this ‌year&#39;s national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while Beijing has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p><p>Beijing&#39;s October 2025 revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows Washington to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p><p>&quot;China&#39;s use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said Li Xing, professor at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, a think tank in Guangzhou.</p><p>China dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself.</p><p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p><p>&quot;This is not just a ‌supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said Nick Myers, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p><p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p><p>During ​Trump&#39;s first term and under President Joe Biden, the United States rapidly expanded export controls targeting China.</p><p>Annual China-related additions to the Entity List, which ​requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 ​to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.</p><p>Since Trump&#39;s return to office, that trajectory has reversed. China-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in ‌2025, roughly half the previous year&#39;s pace.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, ​an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese ​tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p><p>The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department&#39;s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official said the list was removed as it may require changes based on new information and that an updated list would be published, without further elaborating.</p><p>The moderation has drawn criticism from bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, who have faulted the administration for ​approving certain <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nvidia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nvidia</a> AI chip exports and cutting BIS funding.</p><p>A Nvidia spokesperson said in ‌a statement that criticism of the current administration&#39;s decision to greenlight these semiconductor shipments to China was unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors.</p><p>&quot;America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and ​approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America&#39;s lead in AI,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who criticised Biden-era controls, said last year that &quot;export control was ​a failure&quot; and that Trump &quot;realises it&#39;s exactly the wrong goal.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)</p></div></article></div>",

John Cornyn in their increasingly contentious Republican Senate primary race.</p><p>Paxton’s campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2027101165553586430?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:released a video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">released a video</a> from his daughter Mattie Hayworth in which she says: “My dad is a really good guy. Loves God. He loves his family and he loves this country.”</p><p>She also wrote a <a href=\"https://texasscorecard.com/opinion/hayworth-my-dad-is-ken-paxton-and-im-setting-the-record-straight/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:column;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">column</a> for the conservative publication Texas Scorecard published Thursday.</p><p>“My dad is not perfect; none of us are. But he is a man of deep faith, genuine love for his family, and an unrelenting commitment to doing right by the people of Texas,” Hayworth writes.</p><p>The family support comes as the contest between Paxton, Cornyn and Rep. Wesley Hunt has grown increasingly heated leading up to the March 3 primary. It’s particularly notable given past claims that Paxton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/27/politics/ken-paxton-impeachment-texas-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:asked a campaign donor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">asked a campaign donor</a> to hire someone with whom he was having an affair, allegations that were cited by the Texas House in impeaching Paxton in 2023. He was later acquitted by the Texas Senate.</p><p>His wife, Angela Paxton – a state senator and longtime political adviser – accused him of adultery and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/ken-paxton-divorce-texas-senate?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed for divorce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">filed for divorce</a> last year on “biblical grounds.”</p><p>A Paxton adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said the ad featuring Hayworth was filmed before Cornyn released an ad that has drawn wide attention, though Paxton’s campaign intended for its video to respond to Cornyn’s.</p><p>The Cornyn Lonestar Victory Fund, a joint effort between the Cornyn campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leveled a series of attacks against Paxton. CNN could not verify all of the ad’s claims.</p><p>“It’s voting time, so let’s cut through the bulls**t,” the ad’s narrator begins. “Crooked Ken Paxton cheated on his wife. She’s divorcing him on ‘biblical grounds.’”</p><p>“Now, think of the Paxton dirty deeds we don’t know about yet,” the narrator adds.</p><p>In the op-ed published Thursday, Hayworth accused Paxton’s opponents of “ugly attacks” on her father.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“When his opponent can’t win on policy, he goes after character,” Hayworth wrote. “But anyone who has spent real time with my dad knows that the attacks bear no resemblance to the man they claim to describe.”</p><p>Paxton has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/ken-paxton-texas-senate-republican-primary?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:survived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">survived</a> a series of controversies throughout his time as the state’s attorney general, including a felony securities fraud investigation that was ultimately settled.</p><p>“We overcame them all,” he told reporters last week.</p><p>Cornyn and his allies have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/politics/texas-senate-primary-cornyn-paxton-hunt-crockett-talarico?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warned nominating Paxton;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warned nominating Paxton</a> to the top of the Republican ticket in November would endanger GOP chances in the traditionally red-voting state.</p><p>“We will have an election day massacre,” Cornyn said earlier this month. “If Ken Paxton is at the top of the ticket, we risk losing the Senate seat, losing the majority in the House of Representatives, and it will take a toll on everybody in the ballot.”</p><p>In a statement, Paxton said, “Unlike John Cornyn, who’s become a desperate shell of a man clinging to power, my campaign is not about attacking someone else’s family. It’s about protecting America.”</p><p>The three-way GOP field could result in a late May runoff between the top two finishers if no candidate is able to clear the 50% vote threshold next week.</p><p>A University of Houston Hobby School poll conducted in late January found Paxton leading the field among likely voters. Paxton earned 38% support compared to 31% for Cornyn and Hunt at 17%. 12% of those polled said they were undecided.</p><p>One of the biggest question marks in the race is whether President Donald Trump will decide to support a candidate. Trump, who is traveling to Corpus Christi on Friday, has so far withheld an endorsement.</p><p>“I just haven’t made a decision on that race yet. It’s got a ways to go,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “They’ve all supported me. They’re all good, and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens. But I support all three involved.”</p><p>CNN’s Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
