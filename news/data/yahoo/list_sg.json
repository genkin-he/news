The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot . The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls.

But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.</p><p>Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.</p><p>But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government.

The unit was the scene of a money-fueled murder in 2016 involving three men, who killed their friend and sealed his body in a slab of cement stored in the unit.</p><p>Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.</p><p>Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.</p><p>But he said others see it as an opportunity.

Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.</p><p>Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.</p><p>Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.</p><p>But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.</p><p>On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.</p><p>In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained. “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”</p><p>The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Those who were accused of witchcraft were held in this room of what was once the courthouse in Maidstone, Kent. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5i6gp1B.LsSMqYMkxoiRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/a5afcb4409eded89800f15e034706f15><noscript><img alt=\"Those who were accused of witchcraft were held in this room of what was once the courthouse in Maidstone, Kent. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5i6gp1B.LsSMqYMkxoiRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/a5afcb4409eded89800f15e034706f15 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Those who were accused of witchcraft were held in this room of what was once the courthouse in Maidstone, Kent. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN</figcaption></div></figure><p>The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.</p><p>The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”</p><p>Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms.

You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”</p><p>Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.</p><p>“There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”</p><p>After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.</p><p>A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A small stone plaque sits on the edge of Penenden Heath, commemorating those who were killed in the 1652 trials. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dbwbxU.GSiQ1rM2sTmkxag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/897b8356f265b570a5a29d7e541956e8><noscript><img alt=\"A small stone plaque sits on the edge of Penenden Heath, commemorating those who were killed in the 1652 trials. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dbwbxU.GSiQ1rM2sTmkxag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/897b8356f265b570a5a29d7e541956e8 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A small stone plaque sits on the edge of Penenden Heath, commemorating those who were killed in the 1652 trials. - Li-Lian Ahlskog Hou/CNN</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Seeking justice, centuries later</h3><p>Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.</p><p>Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.</p><p>Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.</p><p>“Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”</p><p>“We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”</p><p>Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”</p><p>“By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.</p><p>“To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”</p><h3>Precedents for pardon</h3><p>Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.</p><p>In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.</p><p>There is also precedent for legislative pardons.</p><p>In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.</p><p>Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.</p><p>“This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”</p><p>A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

unprecedented step that GOP leaders have opposed taking until now.</p><p>“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115466450476422202\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Truth

the 60-vote threshold needed for passing legislation, arguing that it would ultimately benefit Democrats the next time they retake power.</p><p>But Trump in his post brushed off that concern, contending that Republicans should take advantage of the opportunity first.</p><p>“Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats,” Trump wrote.</p><p><em>This story is breaking and

flows of rare-earth minerals and hike soybean imports.</p><p>Remaining in South Korea for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit as Trump flew home, Xi was expected to meet Japan&#39;s first woman premier, Sanae Takaichi.</p><p>Takaichi, a regular visitor to the flashpoint Yasukuni shrine honouring Japan&#39;s war dead, is seen as a China hawk, but since being elected, she has toned down her remarks.</p><p>In her first policy address last Friday, she declared that the military activities of China, North Korea and Russia &quot;have become a grave concern&quot;.</p><p>She announced that Japan would be spending two percent of gross domestic product on defence this fiscal year -- two years ahead of schedule.</p><p>China responded by saying that there were &quot;serious doubts among (Japan&#39;s) Asian neighbours and the international community about whether Japan is truly committed to an exclusively defensive posture and the path of peaceful development&quot;.</p><p>On Trump&#39;s visit to Japan on his way to Busan, Takaichi spoke alongside the US leader aboard a US aircraft carrier and said her country faces &quot;unprecedented&quot; security dangers.</p><p>Japanese media said that Takaichi was expected to convey to Xi grave concerns over China&#39;s behavior, including around the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands by China.</p><p>She was also expected to press for the early release of Japanese citizens detained in China and request that the safety of Japanese expatriates in China be ensured, the reports said.</p><p>- Carney talks on cards -</p><p>Xi is also set to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney -- their first meeting since the Liberal leader&#39;s election in April and the first formal visit between the leaders of Canada and China since 2017.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

executive on a US warrant in Vancouver and Beijing&#39;s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.</p><p>And economic and political relations between China and Canada have strained further, even as both countries are targeted by US President Donald Trump&#39;s tariff blitz.</p><p>In July, Carney announced an additional 25 percent tariff on steel imports that contain steel melted and poured in China.</p><p>Beijing announced the following month it would start imposing a temporary customs duty of 75.8 percent on Canadian canola imports, after an investigation made a preliminary finding that dumping had occurred.</p><p>Canada is among the world&#39;s top producers of canola, an oilseed crop that is used to make cooking oil, animal meal and biodiesel fuel.</p><p>Speaking on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur this week, Carney said he and Xi would discuss their &quot;commercial relationship, as well as the evolution of the global system&quot;.</p><p>stu-oho/cwl</p></div></article></div>",
