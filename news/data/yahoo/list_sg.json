Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”</p><p>Two new prosecutors then <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26208161-re-filed-taranto-sentencing-memo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed an amended version;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">filed an amended version</a> of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.</p><p>That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.</p><p>“It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.</p><p>“These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.</p><p>Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.</p><p>“I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.</p><h3>‘Orwellian’</h3><p>On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.</p><p>One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”</p><p>Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.</p><p>Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Page three of the original sentencing memo for Taylor Franklin Taranto.

We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”</p><p>The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.</p><p>The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.</p><h3>Taranto sentenced to 21 months</h3><p>When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.</p><p>Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.</p><p>The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.</p><p>Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.</p><p>Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.</p><p>At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.</p><p>Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”</p><p>Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.</p><p>“I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.</p><p>The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.</p><p>“My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”</p><p>White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.</p><p><em>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-poll-unpopular-post-ipsos/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that</a>.</p><p>But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.</p><p>That’s what happened this week, in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/federal-prosecutors-january-6-mob-of-rioters-taranto?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:case of Taylor Taranto;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">case of Taylor Taranto</a>.</p><p>To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.</p><p>By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.</p><p>“Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26206855-taranto-sentencing-memo-from-doj/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentencing memo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentencing memo</a> said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A circle points out Taylor Taranto, in this image of him entering the the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. - United States District Court for the District of Columbia\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sIWhpPnpBJQp5AFD9o3WNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/80c0db9a5f663ff2c17a5680bbaeb3b4><noscript><img alt=\"A circle points out Taylor Taranto, in this image of him entering the the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. - United States District Court for the District of Columbia\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sIWhpPnpBJQp5AFD9o3WNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/80c0db9a5f663ff2c17a5680bbaeb3b4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A circle points out Taylor Taranto, in this image of him entering the the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. - United States District Court for the District of Columbia</figcaption></div></figure><p>This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you.

wobbled Thursday as traders digested a high-stakes meeting between the US and Chinese presidents, mixed company earnings and uncertainty over further US interest rate cuts.</p><p>US President Donald Trump described his meeting in South Korea with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- their first since 2019 -- as &quot;amazing.&quot;</p><p>The two leaders agreed to calm the US-China trade war that has shaken global markets, with Washington cutting some tariffs and Beijing committing to keep supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>But the two sides have yet to produce a signed agreement,

Dulles Airport in Virginia (SAUL LOEB)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The Trump administration announced plans on Thursday to drastically cut back the number of refugees to be accepted annually by the United States to a record low and give priority to white South Africans.</p><p>Under the new policy, the United States would welcome 7,500 refugees in fiscal 2026, down from more than 100,000 a year under Democratic president Joe Biden.</p><p>The vast majority of those being accepted during the fiscal year which began on October 1 would be white South Africans and &quot;other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,&quot; according to a White House memo.</p><p>&quot;The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa,&quot; it said.</p><p>Republican President Donald Trump essentially halted refugee arrivals after taking office in January, but has been making an exception for white South Africans despite Pretoria&#39;s insistence that they do not face persecution in their homeland.</p><p>A first group of around 50 Afrikaners -- descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa -- arrived for resettlement in the United States in May.</p><p>Trump campaigned for the White House on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants and signed an executive order in January suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program.</p><p>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said that since 1980 more than two million people fleeing persecution have been admitted into the United States under the program.</p><p>&quot;Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,&quot; Reichlin-Melnick said on X. &quot;What a downfall for a crown jewel of America&#39;s international humanitarian programs.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Lifeline&#39; -</p><p>Krish O&#39;Mara Vignarajah, president of another immigration-focused group, Global Refuge, also criticized the move by the Trump administration.</p><p>&quot;For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression,&quot; Vignarajah said in a statement.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program&#39;s purpose as well as its credibility.&quot;</p><p>In addition to slashing refugee numbers, the Trump administration has moved to strip Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, Haitians, Venezuelans and nationals of several other countries.</p><p>The United States grants TPS to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters or other &quot;extraordinary&quot; conditions.</p><p>Trump has said the Afrikaners being taken in as refugees by the United States are fleeing a &quot;terrible situation&quot; back home and has even gone so far as to describe it as &quot;genocide,&quot; an allegation widely dismissed as absurd.</p><p>Whites, who make up 7.3 percent of South Africa&#39;s population, generally enjoy a higher standard of living than the Black majority. They still own two-thirds of farmland and on average earn three times as much as Black South Africans.</p><p>Mainly Afrikaner-led governments imposed the race-based apartheid system that denied Black people political and economic rights until it was voted out in 1994.</p><p>cl/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>WASHINGTON ― Senate Democrats are furious that the Trump administration held a briefing for lawmakers on Wednesday about U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and only invited Republican senators to attend.</p><p>“What the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive not only to our democracy but downright dangerous for our national security,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Thursday, warning that the move set a “troubling precedent” that had trampled on the longheld bipartisan tradition of bipartisan briefings of Congress on U.S. military activities abroad.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-layoffs-blind-workers_n_69026d4ce4b0e763a61c852f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump’s Shutdown Layoffs Hit Blind Workers Who Help The Blind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Trump’s Shutdown Layoffs Hit Blind Workers Who Help The Blind</a></strong></p><p>“They know they screwed up,” Warner added of Trump’s White House. “And where in the hell were my Republican senators, whom we have worked on everything [with] in a bipartisan fashion? Why didn’t they say, ‘Isn’t this a little bit weird they don’t have any Democrats in the room?’”</p><p>The U.S. military killed 14 people in missile strikes against alleged drug cartel boats in the Eastern Pacific earlier this week, part of nearly a dozen attacks on vessels off the coast of Venezuela in recent months. Critics have called the use of force unconstitutional since it lacks congressional authorization. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pressed for more information about the strikes, including their legal justification.</p><p>The briefing was held for Republican senators who sought more information on the strikes and included a memo from the White House Office of Legal Counsel on their legal justification. Democrats have been pressing for similar information but have been rebuffed by the White House.</p><p>Several GOP senators sided with Warner on the matter, urging the Trump administration to brief Democrats on the military strikes as well.

Some military families rely on that support to prevent hunger even while receiving paychecks.</p><p>For many military families who have children with complex medical problems, the government shutdown has already resulted in significant unforeseen expenses.</p><p>“Military treatment facilities are telling us that they’re unable to order some of the medications that families are needing,” said Austin Carrigg, an active duty Army spouse and CEO of Exceptional Families of the Military, a nonprofit supporting military families with members who have special medical or educational needs.</p><p>Carrigg said those families are going to civilian pharmacies where they’re charged co-pays they would not be responsible for at military hospitals.</p><p>“A handful of families that we’ve spoken with are so paralyzed with fear that they haven’t (prepared) because they can’t figure out where to start,” she said.</p><p>Managing those expenses without a paycheck would be impossible for some families, like one military spouse who went viral for calling into C-SPAN not long after the shutdown began to confront House Speaker Mike Johnson as he appeared as a guest on the network.</p><p>“I have two medically fragile children, and I have a husband who actively serves this country. He suffers from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) from his two tours in Afghanistan. If we see a lapse in pay (…) my children do not get the medication that’s needed for them to live their life,” the spouse, who identified herself as Samantha, a Republican from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, desperately pleaded.</p><p>“I am begging you to pass this legislation. My kids could die. We don’t have the credit because of the medical bills that I have to pay regularly,” she said.</p><p>The anxiety military families feel about the prospect of a missed paycheck is compounded by the military spouse unemployment crisis.</p><p>Though half of active duty spouses have attained at least a bachelor’s degree, their unemployment rate is 20%, almost five times the national average.</p><p>Frequent moves – often every two to three years – stifle the ability of military spouses to find a job or maintain a career in the field in which they are trained.</p><p>A significant number of spouses have also been recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/military-families-federal-government-cuts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:fired from federal jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">fired from federal jobs</a>, after multiple administrations marketed the federal workforce as the employer of choice for military spouses and offered remote work options that helped spouses needing to move with service members. President Donald Trump even signed an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/trump-military-spouse-employment?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:executive order to increase military spouse hiring;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">executive order to increase military spouse hiring</a>.</p><p>Others who survived Department of Government Efficiency cuts during Trump’s second term now find themselves furloughed from their jobs or working without pay.</p><p>Taken together, the challenges of military life and the effects of the shutdown have pushed some military families to their breaking points.</p><p>On its website, Blue Star Families, the nation’s leading nonprofit serving military and veteran families (of which, full disclosure, I am a member of the board) is directing military families to partner organizations that can provide no-cost counseling.</p><p>“This is a disaster for many families, and it’s a disaster both financially, but it also has a psychological impact to put your life on the line, to accept government orders no matter what, and to be at risk of not being paid for the essential work that you’re doing,” Blue Star Families co-founder and CEO Kathy Roth Duquet told CNN’s John Berman this month.</p><p>The organization is hearing from hundreds of military families who are less likely to recommend military service to others because of the government shutdown, raising questions about a potential national security impact of this impasse between Congress and Trump.</p><p>As America risks breaking its covenant with service members – to meet their basic needs and those of their family members so they can focus on protecting the country – it shouldn’t be surprising. In a nation that relies on an all-volunteer force, it should be beyond alarming.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
