seek to shift focus onto Donald Trump&#39;s own ties to the convicted sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently throughout the latest Epstein files disclosures, with the former president insisting that he broke ties with him well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>Mere mention in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing, and Clinton has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>He follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday, defiantly calling for President Trump -- who like Bill Clinton had ties with Epstein -- to appear before the panel.</p><p>&quot;If this committee is serious about learning the truth about Epstein&#39;s trafficking crimes... it would ask (Trump) directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said in an opening statement published online.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors even though the Clintons called for them to be open and televised, a move Bill Clinton denounced as akin to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot;</p><p>The grilling comes with greater peril for the former president than for his wife, as he has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein, but said he never visited the shady financier&#39;s private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein associated with the world&#39;s rich, famous and powerful, and was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.</p><p>He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee is probing those who were linked to Epstein, particularly in light of the Justice Department&#39;s disclosures of millions of new documents related to its investigation of him.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hillary insisted that she had neither flown on Epstein&#39;s plane nor visited his island.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify in the panel&#39;s probe, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- Newly released pictures -</p><p>Hillary Clinton said in her opening statement to the panel that it &quot;justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me be as clear as I can. I do not.&quot;</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Bill Clinton features prominently in the trove of investigative files related to Epstein released by the Justice Department but has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing the former president reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>David Markus, an attorney for Maxwell, said recently that Clinton and Trump are &quot;innocent of any wrongdoing.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, where the Clintons reside.</p><p>Dozens of journalists have converged on the wealthy hamlet and the Secret Service erected metal barricades around the arts center where the depositions are happening.</p><p>Republican committee chair James Comer said at the conclusion of Hillary&#39;s appearance that lawmakers had &quot;a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>pel-gw/aha</p></div></article></div>",

(Arun SANKAR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>As dengue surges globally, an Indian vaccine candidate has entered the final stage of testing, raising hopes for one of the world&#39;s first single-dose shots against the deadly mosquito-borne disease.</p><p>Dengue, which causes severe flu-like symptoms and debilitating body aches, has exploded globally, fuelled by rising temperatures and densely populated cities.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) says that almost half the world&#39;s population is now at risk, with 100–400 million infections every year. India alone has recorded over one million cases and at least 1,500 deaths since 2021.</p><p>Hoping to stem the global epidemic, Panacea Biotec has begun final Phase III trials of its vaccine, DengiAll, which has been pursuing for nearly 15 years.</p><p>More than 10,000 volunteers across the country are enrolled in the study, overseen by the Indian Council of Medical Research, with the vaccine on track for rollout as early as next year if the trial results are favourable.</p><p>&quot;We will try to get this vaccine out there as soon as possible,&quot; Syed Khalid Ali, chief scientific officer of Panacea, told AFP in New Delhi.</p><p>Doctor Ekta Gupta, professor of clinical virology at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in New Delhi, said dengue was now considered hyperendemic in India, with all four virus serotypes circulating simultaneously.</p><p>&quot;This vaccine is very much needed right now to control the occurrence of these cases, or at least prevent the severity.&quot;</p><p>- Climate change -</p><p>Monsoon outbreaks regularly push Indian hospitals to their limits, crowding urban wards and leaving rural regions grappling with late diagnoses and poor access to care.</p><p>Higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns create ideal conditions for Aedes mosquitoes -- the vectors of dengue -- to reproduce and spread the virus.</p><p>Children are particularly vulnerable to the more severe form, called dengue hemorrhagic fever, as they are more likely to suffer low platelet counts and shock.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Participants in Phase III trials, which started in 2024, were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo, with the results expected later this year.</p><p>Vaccines against all four dengue serotypes have long posed a scientific challenge. Immunity to one strain does not protect against others, and secondary infections can be more severe.</p><p>Most existing candidates require multiple doses.</p><p>If approved, DengiAll would become one of the world&#39;s first single-dose dengue vaccines, following Brazil&#39;s approval of a similar shot last year.</p><p>It would also be the first such vaccine available in India, where no dengue shot is currently licensed for public use.</p><p>&quot;We will be the second (single-dose) vaccine to come out... But in India and several lower-middle-income countries, we will be the first ones to roll out the dengue vaccine,&quot; Ali said.</p><p>The candidate is based on a tetravalent strain originally developed by the US National Institutes of Health.</p><p>- &#39;Hope for future&#39; -</p><p>Panacea is the most advanced of three Indian firms licensed to use the strain, having developed its own formulation and secured a process patent.</p><p>Inside the company&#39;s research labs, doctor Priyanka Priyadarsiny, head of biological R&amp;D, said vaccine development involves several steps, from proof-of-concept studies to regulatory checks.</p><p>&quot;We are extremely cautious about purity, safety and adverse effects,&quot; she said. &quot;Only after meeting regulatory specifications can a product be considered safe for public use.&quot;</p><p>At present, the WHO recommends only one dengue vaccine, Qdenga, produced by Japan&#39;s Takeda for children aged six to 16 in high-transmission settings.</p><p>Qdenga, which requires two doses administered three months apart, is not currently available in India.</p><p>Ali said DengiAll could be given to people aged one to 60 and is expected to offer long-term protection.</p><p>In India, final approval would come from the Drug Controller General of India, while WHO prequalification would be required for large-scale international use.</p><p>Experts say a successful Indian-made vaccine could be key to affordability and mass rollout in lower-income countries.</p><p>Virologist and Oxford University fellow Shahid Jameel -- who is not connected with the trial--warned dengue incidence could rise by 50–75 percent by 2050 under current climate change trends.</p><p>Still, he cautioned that only Phase III results would determine whether a candidate meets the criteria for a safe and effective dengue vaccine.</p><p>&quot;Phase III testing and follow-up are needed to show if the above conditions are met,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Only then can we have a useful dengue vaccine. It is still early days, but there is hope for the future.&quot;</p><p>uzm/abh/lb</p></div></article></div>",

refugee in Buffalo, New York, days after Border Patrol agents dropped him off at a coffee shop alone, has prompted an investigation into the circumstances of his final days and drawn sharp criticism from state and local officials.</p><p>Nurul Amin Shah Alam, 56, who spoke little English, had been missing since February 19, when the agents left him at the shop shortly after he was released from the Erie County jail, officials said. His body was found five days later, around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, about four miles from the coffee shop, the Buffalo Police Department said.</p><p>Dozens of people gathered at a local mosque for Shah Alam’s funeral Thursday afternoon. They prayed and went to a cemetery to lay the father to rest.</p><p>There are still many unanswered questions about Shah Alam’s death and what led up to it.</p><p>Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan said Thursday the Erie County Medical Examiner has not yet released full findings on his cause of death, contrasting an earlier statement from a city spokesperson who said the medical examiner conducted an autopsy and determined Shah Alam’s cause of death was health‑related. CNN has reached out to the medical examiner for information.</p><p>“The Border Patrol officers had no protocol of what to do with a disabled man who doesn’t speak English, who is confused and lost. And you know what they did? They dropped him at a closed coffee shop. That’s why we do not cooperate with ICE, Homeland Security and Border Patrol,” Ryan said.</p><p>Buffalo Police said its “homicide detectives are investigating the circumstances and timeframe of events leading up to his death, following his release from custody.”</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.buffalony.gov/m/newsflash/home/detail/1614\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wednesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Wednesday</a>, the mayor called Shah Alam’s death “preventable” and insisted CBP “answer for how and why this happened.”</p><p>New York <a href=\"https://kennedy.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2370\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Congressman Tim Kennedy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Congressman Tim Kennedy</a> also called for a “full and transparent investigation at the local, state, and federal levels.”</p><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office “is reviewing our legal options,” according to a statement.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The incident highlights growing concerns over the constitutional <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/30/us/refugees-asylum-seekers-minnesota-detained-ice?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:rights and treatment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">rights and treatment</a> of people who come in contact with federal agents, regardless of their immigration status, in the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.</p><h3>A year behind bars waiting for trial</h3><p>Shah Alam, a refugee from Myanmar, had spent much of the previous year in custody awaiting trial on criminal charges that were ultimately resolved with a misdemeanor plea deal, Erie County District Attorney Michael J. Keane told CNN in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Shah Alam had previously worked in construction in Malaysia and came to the US with his wife and two children, searching for opportunity, Imran Fazal, who knows the family, told CNN affiliate <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2026/02/26/mayor-ryan-sounds-off-after-disabled-refugee-is-found-dead-in-buffalo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Spectrum News Buffalo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Spectrum News Buffalo</a>. He could not walk without a cane, she said.</p><p>He had only been in the US for a few months before his arrest, the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, which was representing Shah Alam, said.</p><p>One of his children told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/near-blind-refugee-found-dead-buffalo-after-release-by-us-border-patrol-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Reuters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Reuters</a> the arrest was a result of a misunderstanding with police. Shah Alam had been out for a walk and was using a curtain rod as a walking stick when he got lost and wandered onto private property, his son Mohamad Faisal said. When he did not understand officers’ commands to drop the rod, Shah Alam was arrested.</p><p>In body camera video of the incident obtained by WGRZ, Shah Alam is seen walking through a yard with what appears to be two black poles. He appears to wave the poles in the direction of the officers, before they fire stun guns, the video shows. Shah Alam is then tackled and handcuffed.</p><p>The two officers were injured, according to the police report. While they were taking Shah Alam into custody, the man bit one officer on the arm and the other on the hand, the report said.</p><p>Shah Alam was being held on two counts of assault with intent to cause injury to an officer, a count of possession of a weapon and trespassing, among other charges, before a plea deal was reached, according to a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/1003916133/Bpd-Arrest\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:police report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">police report</a>.</p><p>At Shah Alam’s arraignment on the indictment in June 2025, his bail was modified to $5,000 cash or bond, but he remained in custody as the case moved to its trial date, the district attorney’s office said.</p><p>In early February, Shah Alam pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges with prosecutors and defense attorneys agreeing that he would remain in custody on bail pending a sentencing hearing set for March 24, Keane said.</p><p>“In this matter, the reduced disposition appropriately held the defendant accountable for the crime while avoiding a penalty that would be unduly harsh and disproportionate to the offense,” Keane said.</p><h3>His family didn’t know where he was dropped off</h3><p>Even though Shah Alam was in the US legally as a refugee, according to his attorneys, “due to the uncertainty of the current immigration climate, a strategic decision was made not to post bail for fear that he would disappear into immigration custody.”</p><p>But later, after consulting with another attorney, the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo said it was determined that Shah Alam’s family could post his bail and he would not be deported.</p><p>Shah Alam was released from jail after it was posted on February 19, Keane said.</p><p>As Shah Alam’s discharge from jail was being processed, deputies notified US Border Patrol, which had earlier placed him under an immigration detainer, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>“U.S. Border Patrol arrived at the Holding Center prior to the finalization of Mr. Shah Alam’s release from Erie County Sheriff’s Office custody,” the statement said.</p><p>A spokesperson for CBP said the agents later determined Shah Alam had entered the United States as a refugee on December 24, 2024, and “was not amenable to removal.”</p><p>“Border Patrol agents offered him a courtesy ride, which he chose to accept to a coffee shop, determined to be a warm, safe location near his last known address, rather than be released directly from the Border Patrol station,” the statement said. “He showed no signs of distress, mobility issues or disabilities requiring special assistance.”</p><p>Upon learning that Shah Alam was ineligible for removal, Border Patrol agents, using a translator program, attempted to communicate with him, according to a federal law enforcement official who said that Shah Alam asked to be taken to the location where he was eventually left. He was offered an opportunity to make a phone call but declined, the official said.</p><p>Ryan, the mayor, criticized the series of events by Border Patrol, saying there were ways they could have contacted someone to help Shah Alam. After it was clear he could not be removed from the country, agents did not take him back to the holding center, he said. There, they could have obtained phone numbers for his son or lawyer, who had both been active visitors while he was in custody, according to Ryan.</p><p>“That is bad policing, but that is also bad human beings. That is an inhumane thing to do,” he said.</p><p>According to preliminary information, Shah Alam did not have shoes on, just orange booties from the detention center, when he was dropped off by agents, Ryan said.</p><p>Neither his family nor their attorney was notified by federal authorities where Shah Alam was dropped off at the coffee shop and he did not read, write or use electronic devices, his son told Reuters. Additionally, his family no longer lives in the area of the coffee shop, Shah Alam’s lawyers said.</p><p>Ryan said that “for multiple days, there was confusion” about where Shah Alam was. When he wasn’t at the holding center, his family thought he was at an ICE detention center in Buffalo, the mayor said. They later found out he was released, which prompted several agencies and community groups to start searching for him, Ryan said.</p><p>A missing person report was filed on February 22 by Shah Alam’s attorney. The next day, a police report said a detective determined that Shah Alam had been in federal custody and closed the probe, but it was reopened a few hours later when the detective found out that was no longer true.</p><p>On February 24, law enforcement talked to Shah Alam’s son who said he last saw his father at the Erie County Holding Center five days before, a police report said. From there, detectives found out Shah Alam had been dropped off the at the coffee shop and searched the surrounding neighborhood, the document shows.</p><p>Later that day, someone called 911 and said there was a man that appeared to not be breathing, according to the police report. The man, later identified as Shah Alam, was pronounced dead at the scene after first responders attempted life-saving measures.</p><p>“How in a place like the United States of America, how does something like that happen here?” a family friend, Khaleda Shah, told CNN affiliate WKBW. “We don’t feel safe at all. The family does not feel safe. And here, especially in the City of Buffalo, we’re supposed to be in the City of Good Neighbors.”</p><p>The family are Arakan Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, Faisal said, referring to the stateless Muslim minority from Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/rohingya?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:fled the war-torn country;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">fled the war-torn country</a> since late 2016 following a brutal crackdown by the military junta that the US has since declared a genocide.</p><p>Shah Alam only wanted to “eat home-cooked food” and “be united with the rest of (his) family,” Faisal told Reuters.</p><p>Funeral services for the father were held Thursday afternoon at a mosque in Buffalo, Faisal told CNN.</p><p>In his statement, Keane said his office first learned about Shah Alam’s release from jail on Tuesday and will move to dismiss the charges against the man when they receive his death certificate.</p><p>“I am saddened to learn of the tragic death of Nurul Amin Shah Alam,” Keane said. “I recognize the desire for answers sought by his family, friends and our community as his death remains under investigation.”</p><p>CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Markets stuttered Friday as traders took their foot off the pedal at the end of a healthy week in Asia, where tech firms rallied on a reassessment of AI investments.</p><p>After surging for the past two years on a rush into all things linked to artificial intelligence, Wall Street&#39;s Magnificent Seven tech titans have been slow out of the blocks this year amid concerns about extended valuations and profitability.</p><p>Worries about the impact of new tools that many warn pose a risk to a range of companies were compounded by a report on Sunday that signified parts of the global economy that could be at risk from the new gadgets, including credit card and food delivery firms.</p><p>That uncertainty has seen a shift from &quot;downstream&quot; companies that run apps and software to &quot;upstream&quot; firms such as chipmakers, many of which are based in Asia.</p><p>That was highlighted this week by another Wall Street sell-off, despite Nvidia reporting quarterly profits more than doubled, projecting more strong growth for the coming period.</p><p>Analysts said the losses showed firms needed to far exceed even elevated forecasts, making it even harder to please investors who have been piling into tech in recent years.</p><p>&quot;Market expectations were already very elevated and part of the positive results had been priced in,&quot; said City Index&#39;s Julian Pineda.</p><p>&quot;There are also concerns related to stretched valuations and Nvidia’s dependence on capital spending by large technology companies investing in AI infrastructure.</p><p>&quot;If the pace of AI investment moderates due to cost optimisation efforts, it could indirectly affect Nvidia&#39;s growth outlook.&quot;</p><p>Most of Wall Street fell, with the Nasdaq shedding more than one percent.</p><p>Asia was mixed, with the Supreme Court&#39;s decision last Friday to slap down many of US President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs seen largely benefiting regional economies.</p><p>Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington edged up, while Sydney and Shanghai shifted between gains and losses.</p><div

Seoul sank more than one percent, having chalked up gains of around 8.5 percent this week thanks to a surge in market heavyweights Samsung and SK hynix.</p><p>Tokyo, Manila and Jakarta also fell.</p><p>The yen extended a minor recovery against the dollar after a top Bank of Japan board member again urged officials to continue hiking interest rates.</p><p>However, the case for a pause was boosted by data showing Tokyo&#39;s inflation -- seen as a barometer for the country -- cooled last month.</p><p>The currency came under pressure this week after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi nominated two academics to the BoJ board who are considered policy doves, days after reports said she had told its boss Kazuo Ueda of her concern about tightening further.</p><p>Oil prices slipped after mediators said Iran and the United States made &quot;significant progress&quot; in nuclear talks Thursday as they look to avert a war in the crude-rich Middle East. The two sides agreed to further discussions next week in Austria.</p><p>The Oman-mediated negotiations follow repeated threats from Trump to strike Tehran, with the US president last Thursday giving it 15 days to reach a deal.</p><p>- Key figures at around 0230 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.4 percent at 58,528.09 (break)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 0.2 percent at 26,427.58</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: FLAT at 4,146.82</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 155.85 yen from 156.11 yen on Thursday</p><p>Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1796 from $1.1799</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.3484 from $1.3489</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 87.49 pence from 87.47 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.3 percent at $65.02 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.3&nbsp;percent at $70.54 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP less than 0.1 percent at 49,499.20 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: UP 0.4&nbsp;percent at 10,846.70 (close)</p><p>dan/lb</p></div></article></div>",
