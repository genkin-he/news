Carrillo)</figcaption></div></figure><p>NASA on Friday abruptly said it was shaking up its Artemis lunar program that has suffered multiple delays in recent years, a bid to ensure Americans can return to the Moon&#39;s surface by 2028.</p><p>That goal remains unchanged, but the US space agency is shifting its flight lineup to include a test mission before an eventual lunar landing to improve launch &quot;muscle memory,&quot; NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said.</p><p>That strategic revision comes amid repeated delays to the Artemis 2 mission, which was originally due to take off as early as February, but now will not launch before April.&nbsp;It is meant to see the first flyby of the Moon in more than half a century.</p><p>Earlier this week that mission faced another setback when NASA rolled back its towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft off the launchpad to investigate problems and make necessary repairs.</p><p>The announced changes mean that Artemis 3, which was meant to send astronauts to the Moon&#39;s surface, will now have the different test goal of &quot;rendezvous in low-Earth orbit&quot; of at least one lunar lander.</p><p>The next phase, Artemis 4, will aim for a lunar landing in early 2028. Isaacman said he hoped that mission could be followed relatively quickly by a second landing within the year.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re not necessarily committing to launching two missions in 2028,&quot; he told a briefing, &quot;but we want to have the opportunity to be able to do that.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Back to basics&#39; -</p><p>The announcement comes two days after NASA&#39;s independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual report that the Artemis 3 Moon landing plan carried &quot;significant risk&quot; including for the number of &quot;firsts&quot; it was attempting.</p><p>The NASA chief said Friday speeding up the cadence of Artemis launches would allow for building more institutional knowledge in the model of the Apollo program, which originally put Americans on the Moon.</p><p>&quot;Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, through the shuttle program -- I don&#39;t think it would surprise many of the folks in the room that our average launch cadence was closer to three months throughout all those programs, not three years,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to start getting back to basics and moving in this direction.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Launching every three years, your skills atrophy, you lose muscle memory.&quot;</p><p>Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Insistute, told AFP at first glance it seemed Isaacman was &quot;making some realistic and necessary decisions.&quot;</p><p>But Clayton Swope of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told AFP it left him with &quot;a lot of question marks,&quot; namely in terms of both the SLS rocket or the SpaceX landing system being ready according to NASA&#39;s timeline.</p><p>Still, with the revised architecture, &quot;you will potentially be buying down some risk that we would have carried all the way to the Moon had we gone straight to the Moon with the original plan,&quot; he said.</p><p>- &#39;Space race&#39;? -</p><p>During his first term President Donald Trump announced he wanted Americans to once again set foot on the lunar surface.</p><p>NASA hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with its own effort, which is targeting 2030 at the latest for a first crewed mission.</p><p>China&#39;s uncrewed Chang&#39;e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026 for an exploration of the Moon&#39;s south pole, and testing of its crewed spacecraft Mengzhou is also set to go ahead this year.</p><p>Queried on the so-called &quot;space race,&quot; Isaacman said Friday that &quot;I think competition is good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re here talking to you about what is a common-sense approach to achieve the objective, whether we had a great rival in the running or not.&quot;</p><p>But delays to space travel are not uncommon -- and could also stem from the progress of NASA&#39;s private partners.</p><p>SpaceX and Blue Origin, the respective space companies of dueling billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, are contracted to develop lunar landers used in the Artemis program.</p><p>Both companies posted praise of NASA&#39;s plans on social media Friday.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re all in!&quot; wrote Blue Origin on X, while SpaceX said it &quot;shares the same goal as NASA of returning to the Moon with a permanent presence as expeditiously and safely as possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Frequent human exploration flights help establish a sustainable presence for humans in space,&quot; SpaceX said.</p><p>mdo-cha/sms</p></div></article></div>",

Pakistan claimed that its military had killed 274 Afghan Taliban fighters and injured 400. Afghanistan said 13 of its soldiers had been killed and 22 wounded in Friday’s attack. The Taliban-government spokesman, Zabiullah Mujaid, also claimed that Afghanistan killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured others, as its forces destroyed 19 Pakistani military posts.

the US oil pipeline it protested, a North Dakota court ordered Friday.</p><p>The decision finalizes this phase of the explosive, yearslong case that has pitted the environmental organization against the company Energy Transfer, opening the door to an appeals process in the closely watched legal saga.</p><p>The Dallas-based energy conglomerate accused Greenpeace of orchestrating violence and defamation during the controversial construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline nearly a decade ago.</p><p>A jury last year took their side, awarding more than $660 million in damages across three Greenpeace entities, citing charges including trespass, nuisance, conspiracy and deprivation of property access.</p><p>Judge James Gion of North Dakota cut those damages in half, determining some damages had been counted twice.</p><p>But the sum remains staggering.</p><p>Greenpeace categorically rejects the accusations, denouncing the proceedings as abusive and a means to silence dissent.</p><p>Legal experts and advocacy groups alike have closely followed the case, given its potentially far-reaching implications for protest mobilization and advocacy movements.</p><p>Greenpeace has indicated its intention to appeal and has repeatedly stated it cannot pay hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>&quot;This legal fight is far from over,&quot; Kristin Casper, Greenpeace International general counsel, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>Marco Simons, another Greenpeace legal official, said &quot;speaking out against corporations that cause environmental harm should never be deemed unlawful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a setback, but the movement to defend people and the planet has always faced setbacks and resistance, and Energy Transfer will fail in its goal of silencing its critics.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer, meanwhile, has objected to the halving of its award.</p><p>Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School&#39;s climate change law center, told AFP the judgment was &quot;devastating.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;It is very bad not only for Greenpeace, but for the global environmental movement,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Global impact -</p><p>The case could have ripple effects worldwide.</p><p>When the initial verdict dropped last year, environmental defenders rallied around Greenpeace, denouncing the verdict as a chilling attack on climate action around the globe.</p><p>&quot;Fossil fuel companies invest billions in new oil and gas while they spread misinformation, lobby against climate policies, and attempt to silence dissent against their destructive business model,&quot; Allie Rosenbluth, the US campaign manager of Oil Change International, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>&quot;They must not be allowed to act with impunity.&quot;</p><p>At the heart of the North Dakota court battle was the Dakota Access Pipeline, where from 2016 to 2017 the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil-fuel protests in US history.</p><p>The demonstrations saw hundreds arrested and injured, drawing the attention of the United Nations, which raised concerns over potential violations of Indigenous sovereignty.</p><p>Despite the protests, the pipeline -- designed to transport fracked crude oil to refineries and on to global markets -- became operational in 2017.</p><p>Energy Transfer, however, continued its legal pursuit of Greenpeace.</p><p>After its federal lawsuit was dismissed, it shifted its legal strategy to the state courts in North Dakota, one of the minority of US states without protections against so-called &quot;Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation&quot; or SLAPPs.</p><p>Throughout the yearslong legal fight, Energy Transfer&#39;s billionaire CEO Kelcy Warren, a major donor to President Donald Trump, was open about his motivations.</p><p>His &quot;primary objective&quot; in suing Greenpeace, he said in interviews, was not just financial compensation but to &quot;send a message.&quot;</p><p>Warren went so far as to say that activists &quot;should be removed from the gene pool.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to AFP&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>Greenpeace maintains that it played only a small and peaceful role in the movement, which was led by Native Americans.</p><p>Greenpeace International in 2025 announced plans to counter-sue Energy Transfer in the Netherlands, where the NGO&#39;s international headquarters are, accusing the company of using nuisance lawsuits to suppress dissent.</p><p>It is seeking compensation for the costs incurred in these legal battles.</p><p>cha-mdo/nro</p></div></article></div>",

Jasmine Crockett in the Democratic primary for Senate in Texas, a source familiar with the matter said.</p><p>“This is Kamala Harris, and I’m calling to encourage you to please go vote for my friend Jasmine Crockett in the Democratic primary today, Friday, February 27, or on Election Day, Tuesday, March 3,” Harris said in one of the calls shared with CNN.</p><p>“Texas has the chance to send a fighter like Jasmine Crockett to the United States Senate. Jasmine has the experience and record to hold Donald Trump and his billionaire cronies accountable,” she added. “It’s time to turn Texas blue.”</p><p>The former vice president taped a similar robocall to be released on Tuesday.</p><p>Harris’ decision to wade into the Democratic primary comes as Crockett is engaged in an increasingly heated and contentious race against state Rep. James Talarico.</p><p>The Texas Tribune <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/27/kamala-harris-jasmine-crockett-robocall-texas-senate-democratic-primary/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:was first to report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">was first to report</a> on Harris’ robocalls in support of Crockett.</p><p>Crockett, who was a co-chair of Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign, is a friend and longtime mentee of Harris. The congresswoman spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in support of Harris, and sought advice from the former vice president before launching her Senate campaign in December, a source familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Harris’ team spoke with the congresswoman’s campaign about how the former vice president could be helpful in the final stretch of the campaign, the source said.</p><p>Harris has not weighed in on many Democratic contests, but when she has, it has been for candidates with whom she shares personal connections.</p><p>Harris backed New Orleans Mayor Helena Moreno in her campaign in 2025. Moreno served as a co-chair of Harris’ first presidential campaign in 2019. Harris has also endorsed Dan Koh, a White House aide during her time as vice president, in his run for Congress in Massachusetts’ 6th Congressional District.</p><p>At the DNC in 2024, Crockett spoke of how Harris counseled her when she arrived in Congress, saying “When I first got to Congress, I wasn’t sure I made the right decision.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“She saw right through me. She saw the distress. I immediately began crying,” Crockett said. “And the most powerful woman in the world wiped my tears and listened. She then said, among other things, ‘You are exactly where God wants you.’”</p><p>Harris wrote about Crockett in her memoir, saying she was among the “younger talents” in the party she wanted to help.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
