trial against a former assistant principal, who is accused of ignoring multiple warnings that the boy may have brought a gun to school before the shooting.</p><p>“I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.</p><p>Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.</p><p>“The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/live-video-3?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial</a></p><p>One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”</p><p>“My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”</p><p>Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.</p><p>The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/09/us/elementary-school-teacher-shot?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:eight counts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">eight counts </a>of felony child neglect.</p><p>Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.</p><p>It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:64 school shootings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">64 school shootings</a> in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges</h3><p>Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said.</p><p>“Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles.</p><p>She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends.</p><p>“I just want to stay home,” she said.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-lawsuit?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:lawsuit alleges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">lawsuit alleges</a> Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.</p><p>Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Former Richneck Elementary School assistant principal Ebony Parker looks on during the civil trial against her on Thursday in Newport News. - Pool/Court TV\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vw8zcBLujXjOEJmoGgPebg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bdfe633761afd8ea06dc51da0ccb79d4><noscript><img alt=\"Former Richneck Elementary School assistant principal Ebony Parker looks on during the civil trial against her on Thursday in Newport News. - Pool/Court TV\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vw8zcBLujXjOEJmoGgPebg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bdfe633761afd8ea06dc51da0ccb79d4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Former Richneck Elementary School assistant principal Ebony Parker looks on during the civil trial against her on Thursday in Newport News. - Pool/Court TV</figcaption></div></figure><p>A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.</p><p>The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.</p><p>During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.</p><p>Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.</p><p>Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.</p><p>The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.</p><p>The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.</p><p>Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.</p><p>Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.</p><h3>Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll</h3><p>The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.</p><p>Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.</p><p>“She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.</p><p>“She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.</p><p>“She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”</p><h3>Injuries were devastating</h3><p>The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.</p><p>A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.</p><p>Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.</p><h3>School official is only defendant</h3><p>Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>The student’s mother was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/virgina-teacher-mother-shooting-sentenced?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentenced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentenced</a> to a total of nearly four years in prison for  child neglect and federal weapons charges.</p><p>The boy was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-no-charges?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not charged</a> with any wrongdoing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758><noscript><img alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/22/us/newport-news-virginia-teacher-shooting-gun-closet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously told CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previously told CNN</a>.</p><p>However, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/virginia-teacher-shooting-mother-guilty?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:later said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">later said</a> authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock.

class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A mass demonstration of ultra-orthodox Jewish men in Jerusalem (AHMAD GHARABLI)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men rallied in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest against military conscription in their community, an issue that has caused a major strain in Israel&#39;s right-wing ruling coalition.</p><p>The vast crowd were demonstrating to demand a law guaranteeing their right to avoid Israel&#39;s mandatory military service -- long promised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Crowds of men set fire to pieces of tarpaulin as hundreds of police officers cordoned off several roads across the city, AFP correspondents reported.</p><p>Demonstrators packed onto the tops of buildings, petrol stations, bridges and balconies above a sea of fellow protesters, some of whom held signs declaring: &quot;Better to go to prison than to the army.&quot;</p><p>A helicopter flew overhead as people gathered to take part in collective prayers.</p><p>Abraham, 27, who studies in a Jerusalem religious seminary known as a yeshiva and declined to give his full name, said the goal was to preserve a lifestyle lived according to the Torah, the Jewish holy text.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t go to the army not because we are selfish, but because we try to preserve ourselves, what the Torah tells us and the rabbis tell us,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>&quot;There were hostages, and we mourned their deaths, we prayed for them three times a day, and for the soldiers,&quot; he said, referring to the captives abducted during Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza.</p><p>Israeli police said one man fell from a height during Thursday&#39;s rally and was subsequently pronounced dead by medical personnel.</p><p>- Crackdown -</p><p>The mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices ignored and several deserters imprisoned.</p><p>Under a ruling established at the time of Israel&#39;s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass from army service.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>This exemption has come under mounting pressure since the start of the war in Gaza, as the military struggles to fill its ranks.</p><p>In June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired.</p><p>A parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist.</p><p>&quot;The Israeli government, the supreme court and the attorney general have turned against them and want to put them in prison -- but it will not happen,&quot; Rabbi Avraham Bismut, a resident of Beit Shemesh, told AFP.</p><p>Whether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver.</p><p>But he has so far failed to deliver.</p><p>&quot;We feel that a decree from above has been placed upon us: such severe persecution of the world of Torah and its scholars,&quot; said protester Arik, who also gave only his first name.</p><p>Responding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties -- one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition -- men travelled from all over Israel to join Thursday&#39;s rally.</p><p>Police announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in Jerusalem and, later in the evening, moved to disperse the crowds.</p><p>Knesset member and opposition figure Avigdor Liberman denounced the rally, writing on X that it was a &quot;spit in the face of our heroic soldiers!&quot;</p><p>- Vital support for coalition -</p><p>The issue has placed Netanyahu&#39;s coalition -- one of the most right-wing in the country&#39;s history -- under severe strain.</p><p>In July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition.</p><p>The other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition.</p><p>The Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, has warned that unless military service exemptions are anchored in law, it will withdraw its support -- a move that could topple Netanyahu&#39;s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats.</p><p>Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist.</p><p>Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 percent of Israel&#39;s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.</p><p>According to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.</p><p>lsb-mib-acc-jd/dc/jw</p></div></article></div>",

We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”</p><p>The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.</p><p>The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.</p><h3>Taranto to be sentenced</h3><p>When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.</p><p>Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.</p><p>Prosecutors are still seeking the original 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.</p><p>Taranto’s attorney has asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.</p><p>Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.</p><p><em>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

A Chinese spokesperson added, &quot;the Chinese side will work with the U.S. side to properly address issues related to TikTok.&quot;</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, did not immediately comment.</p><p>The fate of the app used by 170 million Americans has remained uncertain for more than 18 months after the U.S. Congress passed a law in 2024 that ordered TikTok&#39;s Chinese owners to sell the app&#39;s U.S. assets by January 2025.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order on September 25 declaring that the plan to sell TikTok&#39;s U.S. operations to a consortium of U.S. and global investors meets the national security requirements set out in the 2024 law and gave them 120 days to complete the transaction. He also delayed enforcement of the law until January 20, 2026.</p><p>Trump&#39;s order said the algorithm will be retrained and monitored by the U.S. company&#39;s security partners, and that operation of the algorithm will be under the control of the new joint venture.</p><p>The agreement on TikTok&#39;s U.S. operations includes the appointment by ByteDance of one of seven board members for the new entity, with Americans holding the other six seats.</p><p>ByteDance would hold less than 20% in TikTok U.S. to comply with requirements set out in the law that ordered it to be shut down by January 2025 if ByteDance did not sell its U.S. assets.</p><p>U.S. Representative John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, said this month that a licensing agreement for use of the TikTok algorithm, as part of the deal by ByteDance to sell U.S. assets of the short video app, would raise &quot;serious concerns.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Andrea Shalal, David Lawder and David Shepardson in Washington and Maiya Keidan in Toronto; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Susan Fenton and Matthew Lewis)</p></div></article></div>",

class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The United States already periodically tests nuclear weapons delivery systems, such as during the February 2020 launch of a Minuteman III missile (Clayton WEAR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump has ignited a firestorm of controversy and confusion with his announcement that the United States will begin nuclear weapons testing.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear whether he was referring to testing weapons systems -- which the United States already does -- or actually conducting nuclear explosions, which only US arch-foe North Korea has carried out in the 21st century.</p><p>Below, AFP examines what Trump has said, the state of current US testing, and what it would take to resume explosive tests.</p><p>- What Trump said -</p><p>Trump said in a social media post that he had instructed the Defense Department &quot;to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis&quot; with Russia and China.</p><p>However, neither of those countries are confirmed to have carried out recent explosive testing, and it is the Department of Energy that is responsible for the US nuclear stockpile.</p><p>The president subsequently told journalists on Air Force One that &quot;they seem to all be doing nuclear testing,&quot; and that &quot;we halted it many years ago but with others doing testing I think it is appropriate we do also.&quot;</p><p>He offered no details on the nature of the testing he had ordered.</p><p>- Current US testing -</p><p>The United States conducted the world&#39;s first nuclear test in July 1945 and used two nuclear weapons against Japan near the end of WWII.</p><p>It has carried out more than 1,000 explosive nuclear tests in total -- most recently in 1992 with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>That year, Congress passed a temporary moratorium on underground nuclear tests unless a foreign state conducted one, which has since occurred. Washington had already agreed not to conduct tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater as part of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which it has been a party to since 1963.</p><p>The United States has also been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, but the Senate has yet to ratify it.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In the absence of explosive testing, the United States ensures its arsenal&#39;s reliability through the so-called Stockpile Stewardship Program, which includes &quot;a wide range of scientific activities, from modeling and simulation to subcritical nuclear experiments,&quot; according to the US National Nuclear Security Administration.</p><p>&quot;This program allows us to assess and certify the stockpile with extraordinary confidence,&quot; it says.</p><p>Washington also periodically tests its nuclear delivery systems such as intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p><p>The US military launched an unarmed Minuteman III missile earlier this year, with the Space Force saying at the time that the United States had carried out more than 300 similar tests overall.</p><p>- Resuming explosive testing -</p><p>The president has the authority to authorize explosive tests, and Washington&#39;s forces have &quot;the capability to resume testing within 24-36 months of a presidential decision to do so,&quot; the US Congressional Research Service says.</p><p>It notes that a 2012 study found that &quot;the response time for resuming underground explosive testing is driven more by compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations than by the technical testing requirements or the need to restore equipment and facilities.&quot;</p><p>Doreen Horschig, a fellow with the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the US National Nuclear Security Administration would be able to &quot;get the test site ready within six to 10 months for a very basic underground test.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The timeframe is much longer if you want to test new warheads and new capabilities,&quot; Horschig said.</p><p>But she also noted that there is likely to be political opposition to a resumption of testing &quot;from both sides of the political camps&quot; in the United States, while &quot;our allies (also) do not see a need for (a) return to testing.&quot;</p><p>wd/des</p></div></article></div>",

runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump landed back in the United States Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued right as Trump was going into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>And it came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>The blunt statement from Trump, who boasts frequently about being a &quot;peace&quot; president, left much unanswered.</p><p>Chiefly, it was unclear whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions -- something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Regardless, the statement amounted to unusual nuclear sabre rattling.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>None of that appeared to be true.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- that China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. &quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus responded that she would introduce legislation to &quot;put a stop&quot; to any move at restoring live weapons testing in her state.</p><p>And Senator Jacky Rosen, also a Nevada Democrat, said on X that Trump&#39;s statement &quot;directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees... who&#39;ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen &amp; is unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>burs-sms/gw/des</p></div></article></div>",
