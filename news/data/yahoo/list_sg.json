Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.</p><p>A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.</p><p>The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.</p><p>Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.</p><p>By contrast, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and neighboring Myrnohrad was tightening.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.</p><p>On Thursday, the commander in chief of Ukrainian forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said after meeting commanders in the Pokrovsk area that the situation was “difficult, but the statements of Russian propaganda about the alleged blockade” of Ukrainian troops “do not correspond to reality.”</p><p>Syrskyi said Russian troops were accumulating in urban areas and changing locations. “In addition to UAVs, strike-search operations are being conducted in the city,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had given orders to “strengthen the protection of supply and evacuation routes.”</p><p>Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.</p><p>Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.</p><p>Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.</p><h3>Pipelines blown up</h3><p>As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.</p><p>On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.</p><p>“The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine</figcaption></div></figure><p>It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting.

We last talked around the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when nuclear threats were also in the news.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Our conversation about the developments this week, conducted by email and edited for length and style, is below:</p><h3>What do Putin and Trump mean by ‘nuclear test’?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Both Trump and Putin referred to nuclear tests this week, but neither the US nor Russia is supposed to have tested nuclear weapons since the ‘90s. What did you make of Russia’s test and the US response? Is this the kind of coercive diplomacy you’ve written about or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> It’s firstly important to clarify what we mean by a “nuclear test.” Russia has tested missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. But, in the traditional sense, a nuclear test is a denotation of a nuclear explosive device. Think of the July 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert that you may have seen depicted in the 2023 film “Oppenheimer” (although after the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, most nuclear explosive tests were done underground rather than in the atmosphere). This is not what Russia has done, and I don’t believe this is what the US is threatening to resume, either.</p><p>There are two main reasons why countries test military technologies. The first is to see whether a weapon works as designed. The second is to send a political message to other countries. I think there’s a certain amount of signaling attached to Russia’s recent missile tests. Although it’s difficult to decipher Moscow’s intentions, in testing these technologies, the Kremlin may be implicitly saying to the United States and NATO: Back off in Ukraine — look what we might do if you continue to interfere.</p><h3>More worried about a nuclear crisis today than four years ago</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Do you generally think the threat of a nuclear standoff has increased in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>I’m more worried about the possibility of a serious nuclear crisis today than I was at the end of 2021. This is in large part because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the possibility that Moscow may continue to brandish its nuclear arsenal to help it prevail in that war. But it’s not just that. The possibility of a US-China nuclear standoff over Taiwan is not trivial, especially if one side misinterprets the other’s resolve to fight. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are expanding too, and there is the potential for disaster on the Korean Peninsula arising from an accident or miscalculation. Not to mention the perennial possibility of a nuclear-tinged crisis between India and Pakistan. This doesn’t mean that the probability of a standoff is high. Actually, I still think it’s relatively low. But given the stakes involved, even a small increase in the risk — say, 2% — is cause for concern.</p><h3>Do US missile defenses work?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Coincidentally, there’s a movie on Netflix about the 30 minutes it would take for an intercontinental ballistic missile to reach the US and the difficulty of intercepting such a missile. The Pentagon felt the need to produce a memo responding to the film. Are missile defense systems any better than the coin toss suggested by the movie?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’ll leave that question to technical experts who understand the intricacies of missile defense systems better than I do. I will say that, from a strategic standpoint, there’s value in convincing your adversaries that your missile defense systems are impenetrable. This can strengthen deterrence: If adversaries believe their missiles won’t get through, they may be less likely to fire them.</p><h3>Would Trump’s Golden Dome solve the nuclear threat?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Trump (taking cues from Project 2025) has called for a new “</strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/golden-dome-missile-test-election?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Golden Dome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong>Golden Dome</strong></a><strong>” missile defense shield. Is it worth the cost and would that do anything to solve the nuclear threat?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>That’s a complicated question. On the surface, missile defense sounds great – and in some ways it is. Consider, for example, the relatively high rate at which Israel successfully shot down missiles fired by Iran in their war over the summer. However, in the long run, developing these systems can encourage your adversaries to develop technologies that circumvent your defenses, or to develop missile defenses of their own. In the end, you may get a costly arms race that leaves both sides worse off. The United States and the Soviet Union recognized this during the Cold War, which is one reason they agreed to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p><h3>Will the expiring Obama-era nuclear treaty be renegotiated?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: The US and Russia have a nuclear arms treaty that expires in February. New START, negotiated during the Obama administration, limits the size of the countries’ nuclear stockpiles. Will it be renegotiated?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The prospects currently look bleak. As long as there is tension over the war in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine Russia agreeing to a new arms control deal with the United States. If that tension is alleviated, the prospects for a deal would improve.</p><h3>What about China?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Should China or other countries be a part of that process?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>Many US policymakers would like to include China as part of an arms control deal with Russia. The problem is that China’s nuclear capabilities currently lag behind Russia and the United States. Countries usually don’t like to negotiate from a position of weakness. As China’s nuclear arsenal expands — a trend that is happening — a trilateral deal becomes more likely, especially if Beijing achieves parity with the other two countries.</p><h3>Bring back the test ban treaty?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the 1990s but failed to get the US Senate to ratify it. Trump isn’t talking about reviving it, but if he could get the handful of nuclear powers that have likewise not ratified the test ban treaty — including China, Russia, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel — to ratify it, would he be a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The US Senate vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999 was a setback for global nonproliferation. There are obstacles to bringing the CTBT into force in the current political environment. If the Trump administration was able to get this done, it would be a major foreign policy achievement.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Jersey and Virginia</a> are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.</p><p>In New York City, <a

data-ylk=\"slk:Zohran Mamdani’s base;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Zohran Mamdani’s base</a>.</p><p>CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.</p><p>Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.</p><h3>New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage</h3><p>In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.</p><p>Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.</p><p>Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.</p><h3>New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up</h3><p>Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).</p><p>That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.</p><p>Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.</p><p>This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.</p><p>Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.</p><p>The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.</p><p>Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.</p><h3>Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position</h3><p>While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.</p><p>The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.</p><p>Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.</p><p>And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as <a href=\"https://vote.arlingtonva.gov/Early-Voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Arlington;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Arlington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/early-voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fairfax;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Fairfax</a>.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

It would just give me a category, one our culture fills in with a thousand assumptions.</span></p><p><span>When people find out we’re not finding out, their reactions range from nostalgic to a little anxious.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pelvic-organ-prolapse-40s-women-poop-symptoms_n_68fba9eee4b004dff450f0ec?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Developed A Condition In My Mid-40s That Made It Impossible To Poop Normally — And It Gets Even More Embarrassing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">I Developed A Condition In My Mid-40s That Made It Impossible To Poop Normally — And It Gets Even More Embarrassing</a></strong></p><p><span>Older generations often smile and tell me how wonderful they think it is. “We never used to know,” they say, “and life has so few true surprises left.” They seem genuinely delighted that we are letting this be one of them.</span></p><p><span>It’s the Gen Xers and millennials who are most likely to say things like, “You are so brave!” or my other favorite: “I could never do that — I’m such a planner.”</span></p><p><span>I usually laugh and reassure them that I still have a plan: for diapers, wipes, a safe car seat and a stocked freezer. Not knowing the sex doesn’t mean I’m unprepared.

The ones who have struggled the most with what to buy this “unknown” baby are often the ones who might project the strongest gendered assumptions onto them. I’d rather give them the gift of practicing something different before the baby even arrives.</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>Choosing not to find out is more than a preference — it’s practice.</p></blockquote></div><p>When a colleague asked if I was going to do the “sad beige” thing, where every item in the nursery is cream, tan, or muted gray, I laughed and said I’m doing the exact opposite.

Her Response Changed My Life.</a></strong></p><p>As a parent, I will spend years making decisions about how to protect this child’s autonomy, how to let them express who they are, and how to resist the pressure to force them into boxes that don’t fit. Not finding out the sex is my first chance to practice setting boundaries about how much of my child’s identity I share with the world.</p><p>It’s also my chance to sit with uncertainty, which is something parents of trans kids have to do all the time. Will my child be comfortable in their gender? Will they need support in exploring it? I can’t know those answers yet, and I don’t need to. My job isn’t to have a plan for every possibility — it’s to create the kind of family where every possibility is safe.</p><p>This pregnancy has already been an exercise in acceptance. After months of fertility treatment, I learned over and over that I could not control the outcome — only how I showed up for the process. More than anything, I am just grateful to be pregnant, grateful to get the chance to meet whoever they are.</p><p>The truth is, I don’t need to know the sex of my baby to know they are already a whole person. They are someone who does somersaults after I eat ice cream, tap dances dramatically when I try to fall asleep on my left side, and saves their strongest kicks for the middle of my therapy sessions — almost as if to affirm what’s being said.</p><p>This child is already teaching me patience, flexibility and humility. They are already making me laugh. They are already someone I love fiercely — and none of that depends on the sex printed on an ultrasound report.</p><p>One day, I will meet this baby and learn more about who they are. I will learn what makes them laugh, what soothes them when they cry, and what they notice first when we go outside. And over time, they will reveal themselves to me in ways no ultrasound ever could.</p><p>That, to me, is the real reveal — not a moment at 20 weeks, but a lifetime of getting to know each other.</p><p>I’m not suggesting everyone should make the same choice I did. But I do hope more parents pause before they start writing the story of who their baby will be. Whether or not you find out the sex, you still get to decide how rigidly you cling to gendered expectations.</p><p>You get to decide whether your child’s closet will only be filled with blue onesies and dinosaurs or pink dresses and bows — or whether it will hold a little bit of everything. You get to decide whether you tell them who they are, or let them tell you.</p><p>For me, not finding out the sex is one way of saying:<em> I’m ready to meet you, whoever you are — as you discover that in your own time, and on your own terms. </em></p><p><em>Rebecca Minor, LICSW, is a queer clinician, consultant, and educator specializing in trauma, gender, and sexuality.

FASSBENDER)</figcaption></div></figure><p>China said on Saturday it will exempt some Nexperia chips from an export ban that was imposed over a row with Dutch officials and has alarmed European businesses.</p><p>Anxiety over chip shortages began when the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government.</p><p>China, in response, banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s Chinese CEO.</p><p>Beijing blamed what it said on Saturday was &quot;the Dutch government&#39;s improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises&quot; for leading to &quot;the current chaos in the global supply chain&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,&quot; a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement, without offering specifics.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Those talks on Friday were &quot;a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on... the introduction and implementation of export controls&quot;, Gill said in a statement on Saturday.</p><p>The discussions covered &quot;controls on rare earth elements introduced or proposed by China, as well as an update on controls and developments on the EU side&quot;, he said.</p><p>The statement did not mention Nexperia specifically.</p><p>Separately, Berlin welcomed Beijing&#39;s move as a &quot;positive sign&quot; on Saturday.</p><p>&quot;The latest reports from China are positive initial signs of an easing of tensions,&quot; an economy ministry spokesman told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He stressed that &quot;a final assessment&quot; of the implications of Beijing&#39;s announcement was not yet possible.</p><p>- Automaker anxiety -</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>Its chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components, as well as consumer and mobile electronics such as refrigerators.</p><p>The company makes them in Europe before sending them to China for finishing and then re-exporting them back to European clients.</p><p>European carmakers and parts suppliers had warned of shortages of chips supplied by Nexperia that would force stoppages at production lines in Europe.</p><p>The chipmaker supplies 49 percent of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry, according to German financial daily Handelsblatt.</p><p>The European auto lobby ACEA warned last month that production would be seriously hit.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s chips, while widely used, are not &quot;unique&quot; in terms of technology and therefore &quot;easily substitutable&quot;, French parts maker OPmobility said.</p><p>However, suppliers must get the new products approved by automakers, which takes time.</p><p>Beijing suggested on Saturday that some shipments would resume.</p><p>Companies experiencing difficulties could contact the commerce ministry or local authorities, the Chinese spokesperson said.</p><p>ll-mya/mtp/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>TAOS, New Mexico, Nov 1 (Reuters)&nbsp;-&nbsp;New Mexico became on Saturday the first U.S. state to offer free child care to all residents in a bid to boost its economy and lift education and child welfare levels ranked the worst in the country.</p><p>Under the program, families, regardless of income, can receive state vouchers to cover public and private child care fees. It culminates efforts New Mexico has made to expand access to free child care since the governor and state legislature created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019.</p><p><strong>News: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pantless-cop-matthew-jackson-detroit_n_690290e5e4b057baa82d76c4?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cop Gets Caught With His Pants Down During Hearing — Literally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Cop Gets Caught With His Pants Down During Hearing — Literally</a></strong></p><p>The launch comes as other Democratic-run states, cities and counties eye a step popular among working families.

She and her husband Shawn O’Kelly, a truck driver, earn a fraction above New Mexico’s previous income cap for free child care, which was about $129,000 per year for their family of four.</p><p>“We’ll be able to go on vacation, we won’t have to decide what bills we’re going to pay, like, are we going to do propane or the mortgage?” O’Brien said.</p><p>To achieve a fully universal system, New Mexico must create nearly 14,000 more child care slots and recruit 5,000 educators, according to its Democratic-run government. The state is establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct and expand child care facilities. It is also increasing reimbursement rates to providers that pay entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour, above the state’s $12 hourly minimum wage, and offer full-time care.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>News: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gayle-king-expected-to-leave-cbs-mornings_n_6903e400e4b00c26f070daf9?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gayle King Expected To Leave &#39;CBS Mornings&#39; Amid Network&#39;s Regime Change: Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gayle King Expected To Leave &#39;CBS Mornings&#39; Amid Network&#39;s Regime Change: Report</a></strong></p><p>Alison McPartlon, director of the University of New Mexico-Taos Kids’ Campus child care center, said her waiting list is so long some children do not get in before they start kindergarten.

class=caas-body><p>For months, Democrats, paralyzed by good-government reforms and self-interest, struggled to counteract a push led by President Donald Trump for red states to redraw their congressional lines and add more Republican seats in a desperate attempt to head off Democratic control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections.</p><p>In the past week, however, the Democratic counteroffensive has begun in earnest. A California referendum to add Democratic seats looks certain to pass. Virginia Democrats called a surprise legislative session to start their own redrawing process. And national leaders are increasingly bullish about redrawing lines in both Maryland and Illinois despite ongoing resistance from state legislative leaders.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clay-higgins-snap-cuts-post-stop-smoking-crack_n_6904e1f9e4b0b48d8a1c4841?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Rep.

Slams SNAP Recipients For &#39;Smoking Crack&#39; In Unhinged Post About Cuts</a></strong></p><p>The first step is in California, where Republicans have openly given up on stopping Proposition 50, which would change the state’s constitution and set up the state legislature to eliminate five GOP-held seats in the state, counteracting Texas’ mid-decade redistricting that eliminated five Democratic-held seats.</p><p>Democrats are hopeful California’s success will create momentum, both by showing other states that changing congressional lines to combat Trump is politically popular and by forcing the ambitious governors of other blue states to keep up with the successes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p><p>“If you’re a blue state and you have a trifecta between the legislature and the governor and you have the opportunity to get another seat or two, it would seem to me you would be emboldened to do so if California is doing what it’s doing,” said Rusty Hicks, the chair of the California Democratic Party.</p><p>State and national Democrats have cast Proposition 50 as a necessary response to Trump’s efforts to consolidate his autocratic rule. In the final days, advertising in support of the proposition has featured state and national Democrats including Newsom, former President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-nobel-physics_n_69041bb7e4b00c26f070fa48?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Pathetic&#39;: Critics Clown Trump After His &#39;Absolutely Embarrassing&#39; New Nobel Boast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">&#39;Pathetic&#39;: Critics Clown Trump After His &#39;Absolutely Embarrassing&#39; New Nobel Boast</a></strong></p><p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said he hoped the proposition’s passage would have a “chilling effect” on GOP redistricting efforts, noting Republicans are already facing resistance to their efforts in Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.</p><p>In an interview with HuffPost, Martin stopped short of directly calling on Illinois, Maryland or other blue states to pass new maps but his intent was clear.</p><p>“This is a showdown Republicans wanted, and we’re going to give them a showdown,” Martin said. “This is not the Democratic Party of yesteryear, where we can roll over and let them get away with this.

Greg Abbott and state legislators there to redraw Texas’ maps, and continued by pressuring Missouri and North Carolina to follow suit, eliminating one Democratic-held seat each. GOP-run state legislatures in Florida, Indiana and Kansas have all made moves to redraw their congressional maps. In Ohio, redistricting commission members reached a compromise that made two Democratic-held seats slightly more red. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could open the door for Southern states to eliminate up to 19 Democratic-held seats if it guts the Voting Rights Act in the case of Louisiana v. Callais.</p><p>Democrats’ efforts to counteract these moves have been logistically complicated — many of the states where they hold full control over state government have adopted nonpartisan redistricting legislation or constitutional amendments over the past two decades.</p><p>“State legislative Democrats need to keep all their options open including using legislative power to pursue mid-cycle changes to these maps,” said Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “This is not a fight that we wanted, but this is not something that can go unresponded to.”</p><p>The clearest sign of post-California momentum is in Virginia, where Democrats <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-democrats-advance-plan-counter-trump-spawned-redistricting-red-states-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:began the process to put a constitutional amendment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">began the process to put a constitutional amendment</a> before voters in 2026 that would allow the legislature to circumvent the state’s nonpartisan districting commission to redraw maps.

Rodney Willett, a Democrat and chief sponsor of the constitutional amendment legislation, said during floor debates on Thursday.</p><p>Other efforts to respond to Trump’s redistricting campaign are facing more intraparty resistance, even if national leaders are growing confident they can overcome local objections. Maryland already gerrymandered its district map in 2022 to limit Republicans to just one district out of eight. Gov. Wes Moore and state House Speaker Adrienne Jones, both Democrats, wanted the legislature to call a special session to redraw district lines to eliminate that one GOP district, but Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, rejected this idea <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-2db8-d346-affb-2fbfb2170000\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a letter to colleagues on Tuesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">in a letter to colleagues on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>Ferguson, however, is battling with most of the other leading Democrats in the state. U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost he was “disappointed” in Ferguson’s letter. “Maryland has a responsibility to respond to the Republicans’ outrageous actions in Texas,” he said. “We should not unilaterally disarm and we should maximize our opportunities.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A sign reads \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GmhKZcUA3hxQLiUizLjJ4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/6c5de7f9e834ae1dbef0100fc19c4926><noscript><img alt=\"A sign reads \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GmhKZcUA3hxQLiUizLjJ4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/6c5de7f9e834ae1dbef0100fc19c4926 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A sign reads \"Yes on Prop 50\" during early in-person voting for the California Proposition 50 special election in Los Angeles. <span class=\"copyright\">PATRICK T.

Even if no special session is called, Democrats are hopeful the state legislature could move early next year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ferguson’s arguments against new lines are not without merit: Maryland’s existing map was adopted after a state court rejected the legislature’s 2021 map as an illegal partisan gerrymander. The current map, adopted as a compromise after that decision, has never been challenged and could be upended in the likely event that an even more partisan map were adopted. While highly unlikely, Ferguson fears a legal challenge to any new map could not only undo any effort to gain a seat, but also lead Democrats to lose a seat in the state.</span></p><p>“We do not know how a court would assess a revised midcycle map and whether the court would use party affiliation as a measure,” Ferguson wrote in his letter. “We do, however, have certainty under the current map; that evaporates the moment we start down the path of redistricting mid-cycle with an unclear legal landscape and an even more unclear legal timeline.”</p><p><span>Like Maryland, Illinois’ congressional district map is already heavily tilted to Democrats where only 3 out of 17 districts lean toward Republicans. U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries met with Illinois state legislators on Monday to urge them to redraw districts to eliminate one GOP-held seat. But such an effort would require redrawing up to four Chicago-area districts currently held by Black lawmakers. While those four members joined Jeffries at the meeting and at his presser afterward, that idea is not popular with Black political leaders in the Illinois Legislature.</span></p><p><span>“If a map is produced that dilutes Black votes, the Black Legislative Caucus have articulated that that is something that they’re not going to be able to support,” state Sen. Willie Preston, a Democrat who represents the South Side of Chicago and nearby suburbs, told reporters on Monday.</span></p><p><span>New York cannot redraw districts without the legislature passing a constitutional amendment to circumvent its nonpartisan redistricting commission. That process can’t be completed until after the 2026 election.
