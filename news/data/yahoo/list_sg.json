None of them could say how they‚Äôre addressing air and land routes.‚Äù</p><p>Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.</p><p>‚ÄúThey said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,‚Äù Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, ‚Äúbecause they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.‚Äù The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.</p><p>Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.</p><p>President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/30/politics/hegseth-speech-culture-standards?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unusual event in Virginia last month;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unusual event in Virginia last month</a> that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.</p><p>‚ÄúThese boats, they‚Äôre stacked up with bags of white powder, that‚Äôs mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEvery boat kills 25,000.‚Äù</p><p>Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:US government data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">US government data</a>. By Trump‚Äôs math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.</p><p>Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a ‚Äúfacilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNone of them could say what they‚Äôre doing for fentanyl,‚Äù said the source familiar with the briefing. ‚ÄúFentanyl is the real problem here, and they‚Äôre actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.‚Äù</p><p>Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary‚Äôs office were given a ‚Äúpass‚Äù at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.</p><p>‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even show up with the lawyers,‚Äù Democratic Rep.

But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they‚Äôd written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.</p><p>The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.</p><p>Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move ‚Äúa partisan stunt‚Äù that ‚Äúis a slap in the face to Congress‚Äô war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.‚Äù</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.</p><p>The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.</p><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.</p><p>‚ÄúThere is no doubt that the ‚Ä¶ contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program‚Äôs operation.‚Äù US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. ‚ÄúThe shutdown of the government through funding doesn‚Äôt do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.‚Äù</p><p>McConnell‚Äôs ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.</p><p>The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.</p><p>‚ÄúThis court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ‚Ä¶ to avoid any reductions,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26209680-boston-snap-ruling/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Talwani said in a 15-page order.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Talwani said in a 15-page order.</a></p><p>However, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>President Donald Trump suggested Friday that the government could continue to fund critical food aid beyond November 1, contradicting his administration‚Äôs prior insistence there was no money available to maintain the benefits.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, there always is,‚Äù Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about whether the administration could find funding for SNAP, before arguing that it‚Äôd be simpler for Democrats to side with Republicans and vote to reopen the government. ‚ÄúBut all the Democrats have to do is say, let‚Äôs go. I mean, they don‚Äôt have to do anything ‚Äî all they have to do is say the government is open.‚Äù</p><p>In the program‚Äôs decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.</p><p>The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.</p><p>As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.</p><p>The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at all the options.‚Äù</p><h3>Delayed payments</h3><p>States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees‚Äô information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients‚Äô benefit cards.</p><p>Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.</p><p>In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, Talwani, who held a hearing Thursday, also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won‚Äôt cover the full amount.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments,</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Che Pan and Wen-Yee Lee</p><p>BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, according to a letter addressed to its customers that was reviewed by Reuters, which could exacerbate a supply squeeze that is worrying automakers worldwide.</p><p>The letter, dated October 29 and signed by Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger, said the October 26 suspension affecting its plant in Dongguan, in southern China&#39;s Guangdong province, was &quot;a direct consequence of the local management&#39;s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia has been locked in a dispute with its Chinese unit after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology on September 30. It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s Chinese unit had resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been in foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS</p><p>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the European-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>&quot;While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>&quot;Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wingtech declined to comment.</p><p>A Dutch government spokesperson referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention &quot;concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company&#39;s day-to-day operations&quot;.</p><p>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, &quot;to work toward a constructive solution,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said after a meeting with Nexperia management on Friday that they are working toward a &quot;diplomatic breakthrough&quot; to resolve the situation, but in the meantime they are looking at unspecified short- and medium-term measures to relieve European industry.</p><p>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION</p><p>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p>On October 4, China&#39;s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a &quot;war room&quot; to monitor the situation.</p><p>Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original price, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p><p>(Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Toby Sterling.

He‚Äôd overcome so many challenges to get there: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and difficulty connecting with other kids. As he matured, he gained confidence by participating in cross-country running, drama and debate. He developed a rapport with his peers by listening more and talking less. When he flew to college, he left behind friends from high school, summer jobs and youth groups. He was ready academically and had even earned a merit scholarship.</p><p>Henry arrived early to hike with other incoming freshmen. When I met him on campus the following week during his orientation, he introduced me to his new classmates. I joined them for a meal in the dining hall, attended a presentation for parents and helped him get settled.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-hospice-coping-dying-parent_n_68dc0865e4b0d2dd31581907?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You</a></strong></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=caas-blockquote><p><strong><em>If you believe in deeply personal journalism ‚Äî the kind that connects us in our hardest, most honest moments ‚Äî please consider </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:becoming a HuffPost member today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong><em>becoming a HuffPost member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p></blockquote></div><p>On Friday, when it was time for me to leave, I placed my hands around Henry‚Äôs middle, pressed my right cheek to his chest, closed my eyes and squeezed.

He was an ineffable combination: quirky and clumsy, brilliant and handsome, honest and kind. As a young boy, he was obsessed with collecting rocks and would quickly fall behind whenever we hiked. Once his pockets were bulging, he‚Äôd store them inside his tucked shirt until his belly grew large. We‚Äôd stop and start until we agreed on the number he could keep. One summer, he filled an entire duffle bag with stones before returning home from camp.</p><p>In elementary school, he constantly misplaced things: his backpack, jacket, lunchbox or violin. We‚Äôd find them everywhere except his classroom. Like an absent-minded professor, he wore his shirts inside out or backward or both, and he rarely brushed his hair. He was a vegetarian, and his favorite meal was chana masala followed by dulce de leche ice cream. He always hugged you twice when he said goodbye.</p><p>As he grew older, Henry became interested in public affairs. He loved reading about political corruption and arguing the merits of ranked choice voting. He spent hours on Reddit and shared funny memes I never understood. He was happiest in the company of other teenagers and attended youth group meetings and conferences, even when he didn‚Äôt know anyone. He had a wonderful open-mouthed smile and connected to many teens who needed a friend. Henry created his own butterfly effect by weaving laughter and light into the lives of others. We‚Äôll never know how many.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 474px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:75%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Henry on his 18th birthday.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lI28XKiOp71HkQ6.qawiCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzQ-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/376e4b96f19843e8b87290e37d35a299><noscript><img alt=\"Henry on his 18th birthday.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lI28XKiOp71HkQ6.qawiCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzQ-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/376e4b96f19843e8b87290e37d35a299 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Henry on his 18th birthday. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Elizabeth Kopple</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>***</p><p><em>It‚Äôs been about a year since Henry died, and I‚Äôve only started to process the enormity of his death.</em></p><p>Our family has spent these months as a close-knit unit, seeking therapy, attending loss groups, and passing time with loved ones.
