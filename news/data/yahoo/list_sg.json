first-time buyers of three- and four-room flats in Toa Payoh’s Kim Keat Crest were virtually guaranteed the chance to pick a unit.</p><p>Such muted demand in a mature estate would once have been a rarity.</p><p>But under the current <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/askst-how-will-the-new-bto-classification-affect-home-buyers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Standard, Plus and Prime classification system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Standard, Plus and Prime classification system</a>, some flats with stricter resale conditions – such as those in Kim Keat Crest, a Plus project – are undersubscribed among first-time applicants.</p><p>This is especially the case for Plus projects in less-than-ideal locations, and three-room flats in Prime projects where other flat types have proven more popular.</p><p>This subdued demand has also contributed to a bigger supply of balance flats.</p><p>Plus and Prime flats are typically closer to the city centre, transport nodes and amenities. As such, they come with stricter resale conditions such as a <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/subsidy-clawback-10-year-mop-for-new-prime-location-hdb-flats-to-keep-them\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) and subsidy clawback,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) and subsidy clawback,</a> with a higher clawback rate for Prime flats.</p><p>This is to limit the “lottery effect” that allows owners of flats in such attractive locations to sell for a substantial profit upon reaching the usual five-year MOP. In contrast, Standard flats have a five-year MOP and no subsidy clawback.</p><p>Prime flats were first rolled out under the Prime Location Public Housing model in November 2021. The current classification system, which introduced Plus flats, was implemented in October 2024.</p><p>In 2021, before stricter resale restrictions kicked in for Prime projects, BTO projects in Bukit Merah, Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Kallang/Whampoa were consistently oversubscribed with around five buyers vying for a four-room flat.</p><p>But in the latest sales exercise, three-room flats at Redhill Peaks in Bukit Merah saw a first-time application rate of below one. This was even though four-room flats in the Prime project were oversubscribed, with more than two first-time applicants per unit.</p><p>At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>And the supply of balance flats could have increased as a result.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zHf415CxU__xPLFKd0FKhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/4ce5920895dc61633d01ec61f85d34bc><noscript><img alt=\"At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zHf415CxU__xPLFKd0FKhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/4ce5920895dc61633d01ec61f85d34bc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.</figcaption></div></figure><p>In the February sales exercise, some 4,320 balance flats were put up for sale, more than the 3,000 units that the HDB had initially committed to.</p><p>Many of these unsold flats from earlier BTO exercises turned out to be Prime and Plus flats in Bukit Merah, Kallang/Whampoa and Queenstown.</p><p>Checks by The Straits Times showed that 22 Prime or Plus BTO projects were among those that offered balance flats. Of these, 13 projects saw at least one flat type undersubscribed during its initial launch.</p><p>In particular, three-room flats in Prime projects tended to have low application rates.</p><p>Even after the most recent sales exercise concluded on Feb 11, three- and four-room balance flats in Queenstown – which had a mix of Prime and Standard flats – remained undersubscribed among first-time applicants.</p><p>Demand was also muted for Prime and Plus balance flats in Bukit Merah and Kallang/Whampoa.</p><p>In a written parliamentary reply on Feb 25, National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat said HDB currently has close to 900 unselected flats from Sale of Balance Flats exercises. These flats – mostly three-room and larger – are located all over Singapore.</p><p>The softer demand for Prime and Plus flats can be partly explained by HDB ramping up flat supply post-pandemic. Between 2021 and 2025, some 102,400 new flats were launched.</p><p>As a result, application rates for BTO flats have come down since 2020, when the median rate for three-room and larger flats stood at seven, meaning that there were seven applicants for each flat.</p><p>In 2025, the rate dipped to between 1.1 and 1.9.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 2646px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:213%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VV2DWnfhT8u_Jl_P9jnweg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNjQ2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/78631315caed6b2dc33f643eb0ce9556><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VV2DWnfhT8u_Jl_P9jnweg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNjQ2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/78631315caed6b2dc33f643eb0ce9556 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>In the HDB resale market, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-resale-prices-rose-2-9-in-2025-slowest-growth-since-2019\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:resale prices were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">resale prices were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2025</a> – a respite from the continuous quarterly price growth since the second quarter of 2020.</p><p>These figures indicate that housing demand has largely moderated.</p><p>But there are other reasons why some Prime and Plus flats are undersubscribed, just over a year into the new flat classification system.</p><h2>Why the muted demand?</h2><p>First, first-time home buyers are weighing whether stricter resale conditions – in particular, the 10-year MOP – are worth it.</p><p>Speculative buyers are weeded out, while serious buyers who intend to live in their flats for the long run are given a higher chance to book one. This is the intended effect of the policy.</p><p>However, three-room flats may not be popular among young families given the space constraints, as they are typically around 60 to 68 sq m. In comparison, new four-room flats are around 88 to 93 sq m.</p><p>Families are likely keeping in mind the space needed to grow their family in the years after collecting their keys. With a 10-year MOP to contend with, many would opt for a bigger flat to accommodate their children’s needs.</p><p>Over time, this could lead to an accumulation of unsold three-room Prime and Plus balance flats.</p><h2>Some locations not desirable enough</h2><p>A second reason for the weaker demand is that some Plus projects may not be in locations that are desirable enough for buyers to stomach the additional restrictions that will apply.</p><p>For example, property analysts pointed out that Kim Keat Crest in Toa Payoh is a distance from Toa Payoh Central. It is a 20-minute walk or 10-minute bus ride from Toa Payoh MRT station.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 2487px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:200%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RtOUZ6qyCORXt.kOxsEt1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNDg3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/5cca0dac79e0db4f610a39ef047770f6><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RtOUZ6qyCORXt.kOxsEt1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNDg3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/5cca0dac79e0db4f610a39ef047770f6 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>Mr Eugene Lim, key executive officer of property agency ERA Singapore, said most applicants who are willing to take on the strict resale restrictions for Plus flats look for advantageous location attributes, such as being within walking distance of an MRT station.</p><p>“Flats that require a longer commute to the MRT are commonly classified as Standard,” he noted. “Hence, they might be discouraged from applying for this project.”</p><p>In contrast, application rates for two Tampines BTO projects – one of which was a Plus project in the heart of Tampines Central – saw high demand, with more than seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.</p><p>The Plus project, Tampines Nova, is a five-minute walk from Tampines MRT station and Our Tampines Hub, and there are three shopping malls and various amenities in the area.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 745px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:60%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MStTU5OCWNv1G3Mnb7qlig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03NDU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ab4f99f12ae0baa9c09010e63fc290b9><noscript><img alt=\"The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MStTU5OCWNv1G3Mnb7qlig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03NDU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ab4f99f12ae0baa9c09010e63fc290b9 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at property firm Realion (OrangeTee &amp; ETC) Group, said this is a rare site given the scarcity of land for new development in the Tampines Central area.</p><p>“Projects situated near MRT stations will continue to appeal to buyers, given the convenience (they offer),” she added.</p><p>It is unclear if projects in towns such as Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh fall under the Plus or Prime classification by default, given their proximity to the city centre, or if future projects in such towns may be classified as Standard projects if they are farther from the town centre.</p><p>A clearer picture of how the flat classification system works would help buyers make a more informed decision on the projects to apply for, based on the conditions they are willing to take on.</p><p>This is already the case for BTO launches.</p><p>Alongside each launch, HDB releases the locations of the projects in the following launch. These details allow buyers to decide which launch to apply for, given that applicants with a queue number cannot apply for subsequent sales exercises.</p><p>The muted demand for three-room flats also serves as a signal to HDB on how to adjust future flat supply.</p><p>Mr Chee had previously acknowledged that there is demand for five-room flats in Prime and Plus projects, where such flat types are not available.</p><p>If more five-room flats are built, the trade-off is fewer units of other types, he told reporters in January. But he also empathised with the needs of larger families, saying that he “will see what we can do to build more five-room flats” without reducing supply elsewhere.</p><p>Rather than leaving unsold flats on the market, it might be prudent for the HDB to adjust the three-room flat supply, so as to cater to the demand for four-room and larger flats.</p><p>To be clear, a glut of such unsold flats – reminiscent of what Singapore saw in the late 1990s – is unlikely to happen, given the overall firm housing demand today.</p><p>And a pool of unsold flats is not necessarily a bad thing, as these can be offered as balance flats to those with more urgent housing needs.</p><p>As a whole, the current classification system has made flats in attractive locations more accessible to serious buyers.</p><p>But recent application trends have also pointed to dampened demand in certain locations and among certain flat types.</p><p>Such an outcome is perhaps not the intended outcome of the Build-To-Order system, which is designed such that flat supply is fundamentally driven by demand.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/muted-demand-for-some-plus-prime-hdb-flats-as-first-time-buyers-weigh-stricter-resale-conditions?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Israel launched a wave of strikes against targets in Iranian cities on Saturday triggering explosions and columns of smoke in the capital Tehran.</p><p>The attacks came after US President Donald Trump expressed frustration at Iran&#39;s stance in negotiations over its nuclear and missile programmes.</p><p>Trump said Washington&#39;s goal was &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot; from Iran, and Israel&#39;s defence minister Israel Katz described the action as a &quot;preventive strike&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The United States&#39; military began major combat operations in Iran,&quot; Trump said in a video message posted on his social media site while he spent the weekend at his Florida golf club.</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We&#39;re going to annihilate their navy,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>He offered the Iranian military &quot;immunity&quot; or &quot;certain death&quot; and told Iranians the &quot;hour of your freedom is at hand&quot;.</p><p>Iranian state television reported that President Pezeshkian was &quot;safe and sound&quot; and the Fars news agency said &quot;seven missile impacts were reported in the Keshvardoost and Pasteur districts&quot; of Tehran.</p><p>&quot;I saw with my own eyes two Tomahawk missiles flying horizontally toward targets,&quot; an office worker told AFP on condition of anonymity. &quot;At first we heard a dull noise and thought it was a fighter jet.&quot;</p><p>In Tehran, AFP journalists heard blasts and saw two large columns of smoke rising over the city centre. The health ministry said ambulances had been dispatched but there was no immediate confirmation of casualties.</p><p>Iran, Iraq and Israel all closed their airspaces to civilian traffic once the strikes were underway, and the US embassies in Qatar and Bahrain urged US citizens to take shelter.</p><p>Sirens sounded in Jerusalem and Israeli authorities issued a cellphone warning for citizens.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump had ordered the biggest military build-up in decades in the Middle East, with the world&#39;s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, approaching the coast of Israel</p><p>A day after the United States and Iran held talks in Geneva, Trump said on Friday that the cleric-run state was &quot;not willing to give us what we have to have&quot;.</p><p>But Oman, which mediated the Geneva talks, offered a much rosier picture and said that Iran had agreed to zero stockpiling of any uranium, rendering moot the question of the level of enrichment.</p><p>Iran also agreed to degrade current stockpiles into fuel, said Oman&#39;s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who was in Washington meeting US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>The strikes come weeks after Iranian authorities killed thousands of people as they crushed mass protests.</p><p>Iran agreed to restrictions to low-level enrichment in a 2015 deal that Trump ripped up during his first term in office.</p><p>Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to Israel for talks on Iran on Monday, the State Department said.</p><p>In a rare break from decades of precedent, the top US diplomat will travel without reporters on his plane.</p><p>- &#39;Very big problem&#39; -</p><p>Trump in his State of the Union address Tuesday alleged Iran was developing missiles that could strike the United States.</p><p>Rubio later said it would be a &quot;very big problem&quot; for Iran if it does not discuss its missiles. Iran has insisted that the ongoing talks focus on the nuclear issue.</p><p>Increasing pressure, Rubio on Friday designated Iran a state sponsor of wrongful detentions, a new blacklist, over jailings of US citizens.</p><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday that &quot;success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands&quot;.</p><p>The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said it would hold technical discussions with Iran on Monday.</p><p>The agency called on Iran to cooperate with it &quot;constructively,&quot; according to a confidential report seen by AFP.</p><p>burs-dc/jsa</p></div></article></div>",

the committee have reiterated their call for Trump, who also has well-documented links to Epstein, to be quizzed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be real, we are talking to the wrong president,&quot; said Democratic committee member Suhas&nbsp;Subramanyam, who also emphasized that Clinton had not dodged any questions.</p><p>In his statement, Clinton did not name Trump directly but said &quot;no person is above the law, even presidents -- especially presidents.&quot;</p><p>As for Trump, he repeated his skepticism over the whole process, telling reporters he likes Clinton &quot;and I don&#39;t like seeing him deposed.&quot;</p><p>In a video statement he posted late Friday on X, Clinton appeared to criticize the process in which he had been asked to testify but others had not, warning against the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.</p><p>&quot;I hope that by being here today, we can bring ourselves just a little further from the brink, and back to being a country where we can disagree civilly and we can search for truth and justice, and it outweighs the partisan urge to score points and create spectacle,&quot; he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

motivate everyone to go in front of Congress to say what they know,&quot; he said, without naming anyone.</p><p>Being mentioned in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing and Clinton -- like Trump -- has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>Clinton follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday and defiantly called for Trump to appear before the panel.</p><p>The lawmakers should ask Trump &quot;directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors, with Bill Clinton likening the proceedings to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot; The couple has called for them to be open and televised.</p><p>Hillary Clinton said she had never known Epstein or visited the properties where he hosted world celebrities and powerful business and political figures -- as well as allegedly trafficking young women and girls.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein but said he never visited the financier&#39;s infamous private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14, but died in a New York jail cell in 2019 before he could be tried on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but like much else around Epstein is the subject of lurid conspiracy theories.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- &#39;Turned him in&#39; -</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing Bill Clinton reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein was in the White House 17 times while Bill Clinton was President. We know that Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane at least 27 times. So those are questions that we&#39;re going to ask,&quot; said Comer.</p><p>Clinton said in his opening statement &quot;not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing -- I would have turned him in.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, home to the Clintons, where dozens of journalists and Secret Service officers have converged.</p><p>pel-gw/sms/jfx/ane</p></div></article></div>",

deposition.</p> - Clipped From Video</figcaption></div></figure><p>Bill Clinton on Friday denied having any knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes during what he said was the pair’s “brief acquaintance” under more than six hours of questioning from lawmakers who sought to unravel the former president’s ties to the late convicted sex offender.</p><p>Repeatedly, lawmakers showed Clinton photos of himself with women from Epstein materials recently released by the Justice Department, asking if he had sex with them. Each time, he told them he did not, two sources familiar with the testimony said.</p><p>At one point, the panel homed in on a particularly well-known photo of Clinton in a jacuzzi with a woman, her face redacted. Clinton said he did not know her, and he denied having sex with her, two sources said.</p><p>Lawmakers of both parties said Clinton answered every question posed to him, and the former president broadly denied wrongdoing.</p><p>“I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,” Clinton said in his opening statement to the House Oversight Committee, shared publicly on social media. “I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn’t see. I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn’t do. I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.”</p><p>But the questioning about his sexual activities underscored how Clinton’s past ties to Epstein have come to haunt him and his family.</p><p>Clinton’s testimony capped a high-profile two days in the Republican-led panel’s Epstein inquiry, following the sworn testimony of his wife <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the day before;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the day before</a>.</p><p>The former president defended Hillary Clinton in a video statement after his deposition. “I also have to say something personal. Republicans made Hillary testify yesterday, and she had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of ever even meeting him,” he said in the <a href=\"https://x.com/BillClinton/status/2027582699251048660\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">video</a>. “She neither traveled with him, nor visited any of his property. So whether 10 people or 10,000 people were subpoenaed, including her, was simply not right.”</p><p>The appearance saw lawmakers trek to Chappaqua, New York, to avoid the spectacle of a former president testifying under oath in Washington. But Clinton’s deposition behind closed doors was no less historic. He became the first former president compelled to testify under subpoena before a congressional committee, setting a new precedent that could have sweeping ramifications, including for President Donald Trump.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Attorneys for the Clintons and the Republican-led panel negotiated behind the scenes – through email exchanges, letters and phone calls – for months over the terms of the interview. Ultimately, the pair only agreed to comply with their subpoenas after the House had moved toward a bipartisan vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear as scheduled.</p><p>“I think everybody would agree that he’s been very cooperative, and he’s actually answering the questions fairly to the best of his ability. He has not taken a pass on pleading the fifth for any questions,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, said of Clinton.</p><p>Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the panel, said Clinton flashed “Southern people skills.”</p><p>“He’s a charming individual, obviously,” Comer said.</p><p>Unlike his wife, who testified on Thursday that she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:never met;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">never met</a> Epstein, Clinton has a documented history of interactions with him and Ghislaine Maxwell – who was convicted in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for &#x00201c;The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.&quot; - Clinton Presidential Library\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y3Fdpj9iKnlN2aI30AiZRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ddd28c5870a095749c7c5843f9a23551><noscript><img alt=\"Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for &#x00201c;The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.&quot; - Clinton Presidential Library\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y3Fdpj9iKnlN2aI30AiZRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ddd28c5870a095749c7c5843f9a23551 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for “The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.\" - Clinton Presidential Library</figcaption></div></figure><p>The panel inquired about Clinton’s name appearing in the flight logs of Epstein’s plane, and about Epstein’s name appearing in Clinton’s White House visitors logs, two sources familiar with the testimony told CNN.</p><p>Clinton voluntarily recounted to the House investigators that Trump told him in the early 2000s at a golf tournament that he had a falling out with Epstein over a land deal, three sources familiar with the testimony told CNN.</p><p>Trump said he was no longer friends with Epstein, Clinton recalled, according to those sources.

military operations pressuring the Afghan government, which it accuses of backing militancy.</p><p>The Taliban government has denied harbouring militants and its spokesperson has called for &quot;dialogue&quot; to resolve a previously simmering conflict that Pakistan&#39;s defence minister said on Friday was now &quot;open war&quot;.</p><p>After both countries&#39; forces clashed at the border intermittently for months, Pakistan launched the strikes in the early hours of Friday morning in response to a cross-border Afghan offensive on Thursday night.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s information minister said on Saturday that 37 locations across Afghanistan had been subject to aerial targeting since its operation began.</p><p>It was not clear if strikes had taken place on Friday night, but authorities signaled operations were still taking place.</p><p>&quot;Pakistan&#39;s immediate and effective response to aggression continues,&quot; Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesman for Pakistan&#39;s prime minister, posted on X late on Friday.</p><p>The United States &quot;expressed support for Pakistan&#39;s right to defend itself against Taliban attacks,&quot; Allison Hooker, the under secretary of state for political affairs, wrote on X after talks with her Pakistani counterpart.</p><p>The operation was Pakistan&#39;s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital Kabul and its first air strikes on the city of Kandahar, the southern power base of the Taliban&#39;s supreme leader since they returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Zaidi did not confirm whether Pakistan had carried out air strikes overnight between Friday and Saturday.</p><p>- Surge in hostilities -</p><p>The sharp surge in hostilities drew international concern, with China, Britain, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross calling for immediate de-escalation and return to dialogue.</p><p>Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Friday Afghan forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured several others, while putting the death toll among Afghan troops at 13.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp

killed. Islamabad earlier said 12 of its soldiers had been killed.</p><p>The Afghan government&#39;s deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said at least 19 civilians had been killed in eastern Khost and Paktika provinces.</p><p>Casualty claims from both sides are difficult to verify independently.</p><p>This week&#39;s escalation marked the first time in on-off fighting that Pakistan had focused its air strikes on Afghan government facilities, analysts noted, a stark change from previous operations it had carried out on Afghan territory that it said were targeting militants.</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Most of the attacks have been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has stepped up assaults in Pakistan since 2021.</p><p>Zaidi told AFP on Saturday that there had been no reports of border clashes during the night, but that gunmen -- who he said were associated with the Pakistani Taliban -- had attacked a checkpoint in northwest Pakistan near Afghanistan&#39;s Khost province. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p><p>- Push for negotiations -</p><p>Iran, which shares an eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, offered on Friday to help &quot;facilitate dialogue&quot;, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar moved to allay tensions, and China said it was &quot;working with&quot; both countries while calling for calm.</p><p>In Geneva, ICRC president Mirjana Spoljaric said the organisation was preparing relief operations but stressed that &quot;no humanitarian response can compensate for political will to respect the rules of war and prioritise de-escalation&quot;.</p><p>Last year, several rounds of negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan followed a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.</p><p>After repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.</p><p>Just days later,&nbsp;Pakistan carried out strikes in eastern Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, which the UN mission in Afghanistan said killed at least 13 civilians.</p><p>bur-ceg/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

runway at El Alto International Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed.</p><p>Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down.</p><p>It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses said the weather at the time was treacherous.</p><p>&quot;A heavy hailstorm&quot; was falling and &quot;there was lightning&quot; when the plane went down, Cristina Choque, a 60-year-old vendor whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;The tire is what fell on top of us...my daughter is injured, she has a head wound,&quot; she added.</p><p>Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department told reporters that &quot;between 15 and 16 (dead) people have been
