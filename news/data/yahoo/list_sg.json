Some money in the most recent release went to two tribes in California, but not the state itself.</p><p>“This week, FEMA released over $5 billion in recovery funding for projects, some dating back as far as 15 years — a significant win for states, local governments, and hospitals,” a FEMA spokesperson said. “To be clear, this is about results, not politics.”</p><p>“Regarding which projects are being funded, FEMA is prioritizing based on project readiness and strict oversight. Obligations are made when projects meet all necessary criteria. Decisions are not based on political considerations; the process is focused on merit and accountability,” the spokesperson added.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, DC, on February 13. - Michael M.

The second, who was wounded, was now receiving medical treatment in Cuba, the official said.</p><p>The shootout comes amid rising tensions between Cuba and the United States, which have both opened investigations into the incident.</p><p>As more details continue to emerge about the fatal shooting, here’s what we know so far.</p><h3>What happened?</h3><p>Cuban border guard troops approached the boat after it entered the country’s territorial waters in Falcones Cay, Villa Clara province, just over 100 miles from Florida, Cuba’s Interior Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>A passenger aboard the boat fired at the Cuban patrol vessel, wounding its commander and prompting Cuban forces to return fire, the statement said.</p><p>Four people on the speedboat were killed and six others were wounded, it said. The survivors are in custody and receiving medical attention, the statement added.</p><p>The ministry later said the passengers were Cuban residents of the US armed with assault rifles, handguns and molotov cocktails and that they had intended to carry out an “infiltration for terrorist purposes.”</p><p>In addition, another individual, reportedly sent from the United States to help facilitate the operation, was arrested and has since confessed, according to the ministry. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>The vessel, registered in the US as FL7726SH, according to Cuban authorities, is a 24-foot power boat manufactured in 1981, maritime database records show.</p><p>The location of the shootout, near Falcones Cay, is known for shallow waters, sandbars and beaches. It has historically been a route for Cuban migrants attempting the perilous journey to Florida.</p><p>A sheriff’s report obtained by CNN on Thursday shows that the boat used in the shootout was reported stolen in the Florida Keys on Wednesday night.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The owner told a sheriff’s deputy that he had noticed the boat was missing Wednesday morning and assumed that Hector Correa, a Cuban man whom he employed to do tile work, “took his boat to go fishing” without permission. The boat’s owner told the deputy that he believed Correa had taken his boat because he had been trying to fix two different boats with little success, and his truck was parked next to the dock.</p><p>It was only when reporters called the owner to inquire about his boat’s involvement in the shootout that he realized where Correa had taken it. A witness later told law enforcement that she had seen a man in a white truck board the craft and sail away the evening before. The sheriff’s report states that the truck belonged to Correa.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, Cuban officials said that Correa was one of the four people killed in the incident.</p><h3>Who was involved?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nKIQRCf8azWLpA0aazNCRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bcd5902d281ded4618269cda82da1508><noscript><img alt=\"A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nKIQRCf8azWLpA0aazNCRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bcd5902d281ded4618269cda82da1508 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>In addition to the two US citizens, one of those aboard the speedboat had a K-1, or fiancé, visa, while others may have been US legal permanent residents, according to the US official who spoke to CNN, though that has not yet been confirmed.</p><p>Two of the survivors had previously been wanted by Cuba for terrorism, according to the country’s interior ministry.</p><p>One of those men appears to have previously shared what seems to be a declaration of an upcoming attack. In a Facebook post, an individual identifying himself as Amijail Sánchez González reposted a document signed on January 31 by four anti-government groups that pledged to take “imminent” and “decisive” action.</p><p>Earlier this month, the same individual posted a video saying that if he was injured in any action, he would likely die, noting that he was taking blood thinners.</p><p>On Thursday, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Fernández de Cossío said that Cuba “is still awaiting responses to its requests for information about” the two men “and the other individuals and organizations included on the list.”</p><p>Michael J. Bustamante, a professor of Cuban studies at the University of Miami, told CNN that the organizations allegedly connected to the incident “may be known on certain corners of the Cuban diaspora/exile internet, but they are fringe groups that are unlikely to have direct connections to more mainstream Cuban-American political leaders.”</p><p>While Wednesday’s incident did not appear to be well-planned, Bustamante said it “recalls a long history of Cuban exile clandestine organizing and militancy dating to the 1960s and ’70s — both with and without US support, and sometimes in open defiance of the US government.”</p><p>“One question will be whether US officials (like the FBI) were aware of this organization and its activities,” he added.</p><p>The Cuban government also identified Pavel Alling Peña, a writer from Camagüey who recently posted an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allingpavel/reel/DU1DWt4DGRR/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Instagram video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Instagram video</a> on annexationism and defending national sovereignty as an essential value. Another man, Conrado Galindo Sariol, was also identified as being on the boat.</p><p>Galindo’s son, Norge Evelio Galindo, had been imprisoned in Cuba for his participation in July 11, 2021, anti-government protests and was released in February 2024, according to a post Galindo made on Facebook.</p><p>“I’m proud of what my father just did,” Norge told CNN on Thursday. “I expected nothing less from him.”</p><p>“Although I didn’t know what he was doing, I always knew that if that opportunity presented itself, he wasn’t going to let it pass him by,” Norge added. Now living in Mexico, he said that he spoke to family back home in Cuba and his father’s wife in the US about his father’s actions.</p><p>“Everyone is baffled because they didn’t expect this,” he said, noting that his father had not been back to Cuba in 10 years.</p><p>In 2024, CNN also spoke with Galindo about his son’s imprisonment. Galindo’s cousin told CNN on Thursday that Galindo, too, was previously imprisoned for “not agreeing with that damned government and system.”</p><p>“What I know about him is that he lives in Florida, and like almost every Cuban who emigrated to this great nation, we don’t agree with the dictatorship that’s in our country, Cuba, a dictatorship that has been in power for 67 years, oppressing the people and with a Cuba in misery and destruction,” Leonardo Galindo said.</p><p>“But I didn’t imagine he and other compatriots would be on that journey to Cuba,” the cousin added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Cuba said in a statement that one of its members was among those killed, but distanced itself from the attack, saying it was not aware of his intentions. CNN has reached out to the party for comment.</p><p>While some anti-government Cuban exiles living in the US might hail the groups allegedly involved in Wednesday’s incident as “heroes or martyrs,” said Helen Yaffe, a professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow and Cuba expert, they are not well known or supported within Cuba.</p><h3>What has the US said?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to reporters at Robert L.

Gimenez and Rick Scott, called for accountability and a thorough investigation into the use of lethal force against individuals aboard a US-registered vessel.</p><h3>Why are tensions so high?</h3><p>The incident occurred amid <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/29/americas/us-cuba-oil-blockade-threat-of-war-intl-latam?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:heightened tensions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">heightened tensions</a> between Havana and Washington, which has imposed sanctions and restrictions on oil shipments from Venezuela, Cuba’s main supplier. Following the US capture in January of Venezuelan leader and Cuban ally Nicolás Maduro — an operation in which 32 Cuban personnel guarding Maduro were killed — the administration of US President Donald Trump has set its sights on Cuba, blocking all oil deliveries to the island and talking of regime change.</p><p>The blockade has brought Cuba’s economy to its knees, with the Caribbean nation experiencing its worst era of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/americas/cuba-us-trump-oil-tourism-intl-latam?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:economic uncertainty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">economic uncertainty</a> in decades and the United Nations warning of a potential humanitarian “collapse.”</p><p>The US slightly <a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/1238\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:eased the embargo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">eased the embargo </a>on Wednesday, saying it would grant licenses to private Cuban entities looking to resell oil from Venezuela.</p><h3>Has this happened before?</h3><p>In 2022, the Interior Ministry in Havana said Cuba had <a href=\"https://misiones.cubaminrex.cu/en/articulo/ministry-interior-reports-violent-incidents-related-illegal-departures-country\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:intercepted 13 US speedboats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">intercepted 13 US speedboats</a> with 23 crew members whom it accused of “carrying out human trafficking operations” by taking people from the island to the US.</p><p>The fatal shooting also took place just one day after the 30th anniversary of the Cuban military’s downing of two planes belonging to the Cuban-American humanitarian organization Brothers to the Rescue over the waters north of Havana. Four people were killed in the incident.</p><p>José Basulto, the leader of Brothers to the Rescue and one of the few survivors of the shootdown in 1996, told CNN that he did not know any of the men allegedly involved in Wednesday’s incident, and was not aware of their organizations.</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/02/18/2026-03272/continuation-of-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-cuba-and-of-the-emergency-authority-relating\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:extended a Clinton-era emergency measure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">extended a Clinton-era emergency measure</a> enacted after Cuba shot down the planes, which allows US authorities to board any vessel that may be headed toward Cuba.</p><p><em>CNN’s Mauricio Torres, Hira Humayun, Lex Harvey, German Padinger, Jack Guy, Max Saltman, Patrick Oppmann and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Guthrie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Savannah Guthrie</a>, has stretched into a fourth, anguished week, with mounting pressure on investigators and a family grappling with uncertainty.</p><p>Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31, before she was <a

kidnapped;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">apparently kidnapped</a>, disappearing from her secluded home in Arizona’s Catalina Foothills without her phone — or critical medications.</p><p>The days since she vanished have been marked by disturbing twists: purported ransom notes demanding millions of dollars, an intensive investigation, emotional video pleas from Nancy Guthrie’s children begging for the return of their mother, and video of an armed, masked person tampering with the doorbell camera at her Tucson home.</p><h3>The latest on where things stand</h3><p>• <strong>Guthrie family offers a million dollars reward:</strong> After nearly a week of silence, Savannah Guthrie posted an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:emotional new video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">emotional new video</a> on social media saying the family will offer up to $1 million for information leading to her mother’s recovery.</p><p>• <strong>No leading theory:</strong> Authorities say they believe Nancy Guthrie was removed from the home against her will. But investigators still have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-15-26?post-id=cmlom18s200003b6rgicohos8&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:no leading theory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">no leading theory</a> about a motive, according to a source. They have not ruled out the possibility more than one person may have been involved, the sheriff said Friday.</p><p>• <strong>Doorbell footage from two dates: </strong>The masked person seen on the doorbell camera footage of Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home the morning she is believed to have been kidnapped was also recorded at her doorstep on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:another night;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">another night</a>, a source told CNN. FBI Director Kash Patel’s release of the image believed to be from a different night surprised local and federal investigators on the ground as they hoped to keep the detail confidential, another source said.</p><p>• <strong>DNA analysis:</strong> Investigators continue to run lab analysis on DNA found at Nancy Guthrie’s house, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Thursday. DNA on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-16-26?post-id=cmlp5jx3e00003b6r0fl2i78k&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:gloves;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gloves</a> found 2 miles from the home did not return any matches in the national database known as CODIS, and doesn’t match <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-savannah-missing-mom-02-13-26?post-id=cmllg8qzf000h356r0ur5bzje&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:DNA found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">DNA found</a> the house, either, Nanos <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-search-update-02-17-26?post-id=cmlqx582z00003b6py3nhtlrq&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said</a>.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>• Other evidence: </strong>Officials determine the man seen in doorbell video was carrying an Ozark backpack, the sheriff said, but are still trying to identify other items and where they might have been purchased. Teams of FBI and local law enforcement investigators are also reviewing “thousands of hours” of video obtained from the greater Tucson area, a law enforcement official familiar with the case told CNN.</p><p>• <strong>Family not suspects:</strong> Nancy Guthrie’s adult children and their spouses <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-16-26?post-id=cmlpnlzve00003b6pljbq4hqp&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:are not suspects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">are not suspects</a> in her February 1 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/timeline-nancy-guthrie-search?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:disappearance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">disappearance</a>, the sheriff says, calling any suggestion otherwise “cruel.”</p><p>• <strong>Tip lines:</strong> If you have information that could help investigators, you can call 1-800-CALL-FBI or 520-351-4900. You can also submit information at <a href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/home\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:tips.fbi.gov;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">tips.fbi.gov</a>.</p><h3>Timeline of key events</h3><h3>Wednesday, February 25</h3><p>Several people were seen walking around Nancy Guthrie’s property Wednesday morning — the most activity CNN has seen at the residence in days.</p><p>Federal prosecutors, accompanied by FBI Special Agents, visited the home Wednesday, the US Attorney’s office in Phoenix confirmed Thursday.</p><p>“Federal prosecutors traditionally work with all levels of law enforcement and have done so throughout this investigation,” said Timothy Courchaine, US Attorney for the District of Arizona, adding they’ll “go anywhere, do anything, and persevere always to find her.”</p><h3>Tuesday, February 24</h3><p>Twenty-four days since her mother disappeared, Savannah Guthrie acknowledged Nancy “may already be gone.” In an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:emotional video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">emotional video</a>, the “Today” host said her family is “blowing on the embers of hope” and still believes their mother will come home. But, she acknowledged a difficult truth.</p><p>“She may already be gone,” Guthrie said. “She may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves … If that is what is to be, then we will accept it. But we need to know where she is.”</p><p>The family is offering a personal reward of up to $1 million for any information leading to Nancy’s recovery, Guthrie said. This action was taken after careful consultation and in coordination with law enforcement a source close to the family told CNN.</p><p>“Somebody knows. We are begging you to please come forward now,” she said.</p><p>She also acknowledged her family is not alone in suffering through the “uncertainty” of a missing loved one. So, she said, they are also donating $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p><p>“We are hoping that the attention that has been given to our mom and our family will extend to all the families like ours who are in need and need prayers and need support,” Guthrie said.</p><p>The family’s reward is in addition to the FBI’s $100,000 reward for information about Guthrie, the agency <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIPhoenix/status/2026296993211994352\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said Tuesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said Tuesday</a>. The announcement raises the total reward to up to $1.2 million for information on Guthrie’s disappearance.</p><p>The Guthries have continued to “stay in lockstep” with investigators, a source close to the family told CNN. The reward comes after investigative updates have appeared to slow as the search enters its fourth week.</p><p>In other developments, the FBI will be shifting its investigative command post from Tucson to Phoenix, FBI Phoenix Public Information Officer Kevin Smith told CNN Tuesday, while emphasizing that everyone who is working on the ground with the sheriff’s department will stay and it is not a reduction in resources.</p><h3>Monday, February 23</h3><p>The masked person seen on the doorbell camera footage of Guthrie’s home the morning she is believed to have been kidnapped was also at her doorstep on another night, a source tells CNN.</p><p>The photos and video of the masked person on Guthrie’s doorstep — released <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2021285842044494279\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:by the FBI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">by the FBI</a> on February 10 — were taken on two different days, rather than just on February 1, when authorities believe she was abducted, the source says. That’s because the masked suspect is <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2021285842044494279/photo/2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not wearing a backpack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not wearing a backpack</a> in one of them, according to the source.</p><p>ABC News <a href=\"https://abcnews.com/US/masked-suspect-nancy-guthrie-abduction-appeared-visit-house/story?id=130427336\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:first reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">first reported</a> the suspect appears to have been at her door before February 1.</p><p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department <a href=\"https://x.com/pimasheriff/status/2026133346506666410?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said in a statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said in a statement</a> “there is no date or time stamp associated with these images” and “any suggestion that the photographs were taken on different days is purely speculative.” It added the investigation is ongoing and “conclusions will be guided by verifiable evidence and established facts.” CNN reached out to the FBI Phoenix office for comment.</p><p>The photos and video show a masked, armed suspect approach the door and tamper with the doorbell camera the morning of her disappearance.

New research says it&#39;s a tale as old as time.</p><p>A study out Thursday in Science argues that Neanderthal men and human women were particularly inclined to mate, a sexual habit that offers insight into the evolution of the modern human genome.</p><p>In 2010 scientists reconstructed the Neanderthal genome -- blockbuster research that allowed for analysis making clear that the species interbred.</p><p>Most people living today have some residual fragments of DNA from our ancient evolutionary cousins.</p><p>Research indicates both groups descended from a population living in Africa some million years ago.</p><p>They eventually diverged, with anatomically modern humans evolving in Africa, and Neanderthals migrating across Eurasia.</p><p>But over hundreds of millennia, human migrations resulted in interbreeding, researchers say.</p><p>Yet humans have little to no Neanderthal DNA on our X chromosomes -- one of two human chromosomes that determines an embryo&#39;s sex.</p><p>That was assumed to be the result of a natural selection.</p><p>The genes were biologically &quot;toxic&quot; to humans, researchers hypothesized, and eventually purged out -- in essence, the children who inherited those traits might not have lived to pass them on.</p><p>But the new study from geneticists at the University of Pennsylvania suggests the phenomenon has more social origins, and were actually the result of &quot;long-standing mating preferences.&quot;</p><p>The team analyzed modern human DNA preserved in Neanderthals, and found an abundance on the X chromosome -- the mirror opposite of humans.</p><p>That result allowed them to rule out that reproduction between the species was incompatible.</p><p>Instead the gene flow &quot;occurred predominantly between Neanderthal males and anatomically modern human females,&quot; said Alexander Platt, a senior research scientist on the study.</p><p>Females carry two X chromosomes, and males carry one. Therefore, if Neanderthal males and modern human females were mating more frequently, more human X chromosomes would enter the Neanderthal gene pool -- and fewer Neanderthal X chromosomes would end up in human populations.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Researchers said that sex-biased migration could also offer clues. But ancient mating habits &quot;provided the simplest explanation,&quot; Platt said.</p><p>The larger &quot;why&quot; is unknown: Neanderthal men and modern human women might have been mating by choice, or violence and coercion could have been involved.</p><p>Researchers say they now hope to analyze the development of this mating pattern.</p><p>Possibilities include probing gender dynamics within Neanderthal society, or migration habits -- perhaps males were likely to leave their societies while females stayed with their families, for example.</p><p>mdo/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

The rest of the time he trained Chinese pilots, it said.</p><p>“Brown’s alleged betrayal exposed sensitive military tactics, threatening the security of our nation, our armed forces, and our allies,” said FBI New York Assistant Director in Charge James Barnacle.</p><p>Aviation analyst Peter Layton of the Griffith Asia Institute, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer, told CNN that China could have learned a range of things from Brown.</p><p>“If I was China, I would also be most interested in ‘nuclear weapons delivery systems’ and the tactics planned to deliver nuclear weapons,” Layton said.</p><p>China could have also tried to learn what tactics F-35 pilots use to avoid detection in both offensive strike and air defense roles.</p><p>And Layton said US allies and partners are likely to be asking hard questions of the Pentagon.</p><p>“If I was an allied nation flying the F-35 I would be very strongly requesting what the US finds has been passed onto the Chinese. And what changes to tactics and procedures the US now suggests should be made,” Layton said.</p><p>But Layton said it’s possible as a simulator instructor, Brown may have just been training US pilots in basic flying, such as take-offs, landings and flying on instruments.</p><p>“So possibly no tactics,” he said.</p><p>Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said even gaining knowledge of those basic techniques could be useful to China.</p><p>Schuster told CNN that “the instructor pilot’s instincts in training and simulated combat flights tell us much about his past training…and what tactics the instructor’s air force of origin may employ in an intercept or ‘dog fight’ once engaged.”</p><p>“The instructor insights add context to the remotely collected technical intelligence-based information and open-source materials. You can build a very thorough and complete picture by fusing all that together,” he added.</p><p>The US attorney’s statement said Brown was eager to be training fighter pilots in China.</p><p>“In the resumé he prepared for his application, Brown wrote his ‘objective’ as ‘Instructor Fighter Pilot,’” it said, adding that later Brown told a co-conspirator upon his arrival in China: “Now…. I have the chance to fly and instruct fighter pilots again!”</p><p>Asked about the case at a briefing on Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment.</p><p>“I am not familiar with the situation you mentioned,” Mao said.</p><p>Brown allegedly made contact with China through a co-conspirator who was in contact with Stephen Su Bin, a Chinese national who in 2016 pleaded guilty to conspiring to give sensitive US military and export data to China and was sentenced to nearly four years in a US prison.</p><p>CNN anchor Jim <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/shadow-war-chinese-spy?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Scuitto wrote about Su’s case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Scuitto wrote about Su’s case</a> in his 2019 book, “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062853646/the-shadow-war/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America</a><em>,</em>” saying Su and his partners stole tens of thousands of computer files related to the F-22 and F-35 fighters<em>.</em></p><p>Brown is not the first American flier to be charged with helping train Chinese pilots, nor the first to be linked to Su.</p><p>Former US Marine Corps pilot <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/australia/duggan-us-fighter-pilot-extradition-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Daniel Duggan was charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Daniel Duggan was charged</a> in 2017 of violating the Arms Export Control Act, specifically for allegedly helping Chinese pilots learn aircraft carrier operations.</p><p>Duggan, a naturalized Australian citizen, was arrested in New South Wales in 2022, and is pending extradition to the US.</p><p>He has denied the charges, claiming that US officials knew about his activities and that he was only training civilian pilots as China’s aviation sector boomed.</p><p>US authorities found correspondence with Duggan on electronic devices seized from Su Bin, Duggan’s lawyer Bernard Collaery said in a submission to Australian Attorney General Mark Dreyfus, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/australia/duggan-us-marine-pilot-australia-chinese-hacker-intl-latam?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a 2024 Reuters report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a 2024 Reuters report</a>.</p><p>Messages retrieved from Su Bin’s electronic devices show he paid for Duggan’s travel from Australia to Beijing in May 2012, according to extradition documents lodged by the United States with the Australian court, according to Reuters.

testified.</p><p>A couple days after Eric Richins was found dead on March 4, 2022, Lauber said she spoke with Kouri Richins on the phone.</p><p>“I said, ‘Please tell me these pills were not for him,’” Lauber recalled telling Richins.

She spoke with investigators several times before she was given immunity, which she said she did in part to take responsibility.</p><p>“I already knew Eric had passed away. But when they told – when they had mentioned that it was from an overdose, that hit hard,” Lauber said, dabbing her eyes with tissues.</p><p>“Only for the fact that, if that’s what happened, I needed to step up and take accountability of my part in this, what happened and what I was asked for.”</p><p>On cross-examination, the defense worked to undermine Lauber’s credibility, highlighting her history of drug use – including around the time she said she purchased the drugs in question – and the deal she reached with prosecutors to secure her testimony against Richins.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>‘A little clear baggie with some pills’</h3><p>Lauber testified she began obtaining illicit drugs for Richins around late January or early February of 2022.</p><p>Lauber bought an envelope of opiate pills from a woman she worked with and then gave them to Kouri Richins in her driveway the next morning, she said. Richins later asked for drugs a second time, saying the investor wanted something stronger, Lauber said.</p><p>Lauber testified she got in touch with a man who said he had pills containing fentanyl. When she texted Richins about the fentanyl pills, Richins responded, “Okay, go ahead and get them,” according to Lauber’s testimony.</p><p>Richins left Lauber approximately $1,000 cash inside of a house she was flipping, Lauber said. After she retrieved the money, Lauber said she met the man at a gas station on February 11, 2022.</p><p>“He handed me a little clear baggie with some pills in it,” she said.</p><p>Lauber testified she left the pills in the outdoor firepit of the same home where she picked up the money.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Kouri Richins tried to poison her husband a few days later, on Valentine’s Day, by lacing his sandwich. Eric Richins told his friends he broke out in hives and thought he was going to die after eating the sandwich, according to charging documents.</p><p>“I think my wife is trying to poison me,” he told one friend, per court records.</p><p>Around the end of February 2022, Richins again asked for stronger drugs, referencing “some of the Michael Jackson stuff,” Lauber confirmed in her testimony. Jackson died of a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/24/showbiz/michael-jackson-death-trial?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:propofol overdose;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">propofol overdose</a> in 2009.</p><p>Lauber testified she asked the same man for more pills and picked up $1,000 cash that Richins left in the same home. When she met the man at the gas station, he gave her a baggie of light blue pills, she said. Richins later picked up the pills in Lauber’s driveway, she testified.</p><p>When Eric Richins was found dead on March 4, 2022, he had roughly five times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system, according to charging documents.</p><p>Three days after her husband’s death, Richins texted Lauber “still have your hookup?” according to phone records displayed in court Thursday.</p><p>Lauber testified she then purchased drugs for Richins again after receiving a $1,300 check from her. The check, shown in court Thursday, was made out to Lauber for “Construction clean Midway.” At the time of Eric Richins’ death, his wife was working to flip a home in Midway, Utah.</p><p>“I never cleaned a house ever in my life for thirteen hundred dollars,” Lauber said.</p><p>Lauber later asked Richins if she needed any more pills, she testified. Richins allegedly responded she did not because her investor had “left town.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I8hJs61KPfv_g8alD7688g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5495469c8afd5f116cbbcbfb93ad7d20><noscript><img alt=\"Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I8hJs61KPfv_g8alD7688g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5495469c8afd5f116cbbcbfb93ad7d20 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Defense highlights deal for witness’ testimony</h3><p>Richins’ defense has worked to undercut Lauber, questioning her reliability based on purported inconsistencies in her statements and her history of drug use.</p><p>Lauber acknowledged her struggle with addiction Thursday, and said she has been sober for more than four years.</p><p>In her opening statement, defense attorney Kathy Nester said Lauber first told investigators Kouri Richins asked for another drug, oxycodone.

By comparison, it said peak ​British electricity demand on February 11 was ‌45 GW.</p><p>OpenAI said in January it would create a community plan for each of the sites in its Stargate operation, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centres for training and inference.</p><p>Tech companies are investing directly in power infrastructure as energy access becomes a critical constraint on AI expansion, with the push for larger and more numerous data centres driving electricity demand higher.</p><p>In ‌Havering, east London, Ian Pirie, Coordinator Friends of the ​Earth Havering, said plans to build locally were &quot;completely inappropriate ​in a semi-rural Green Belt area&quot;, citing ​what he called its power and water needs and the destruction of ‌farmland.</p><p>Leigh Tugwood, Co-chair of Iver Heath Residents Association, ​protesting against a build ​in Buckinghamshire, said he was concerned that datacentre development was being fast-tracked at the expense of local communities.</p><p>&quot;We are, therefore, in support of a moratorium on all future hyperscale ​data centre development unless and ‌until there is informed debate, a public inquiry and a meaningful community-designed engagement framework ​that ensures ownership of the process by those most likely to be impacted,&quot; he ​said.</p><p>(Reporting by Simon Jessop, Editing by William Maclean)</p></div></article></div>",
