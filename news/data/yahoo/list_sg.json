Mikie Sherrill - Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former President Barack Obama is hitting the campaign trail in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, speaking at rallies for the Democratic candidates in the states’ gubernatorial races ahead of Tuesday’s elections.</p><p>Obama is set to stump for former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race, in Norfolk early Saturday afternoon. In the evening, he will be in Newark with Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.</p><p>Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/barack-obama-donald-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:stepped up his warnings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">stepped up his warnings</a> about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.</p><p>He’s the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democratic-campaign-trail-2028-hopefuls?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:also hit the trail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">also hit the trail</a> for the two candidates. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a Thursday appearance with Sherrill, touted their efforts to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City, and lambasted Trump’s decision to terminate that project.</p><p>“The problem is that Jack Ciattarelli knows that standing up for New Jersey would require standing up to Donald Trump, and he just doesn’t have the backbone to do that,” Buttigieg said.</p><p>Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.</p><p>After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”</p><p>The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.</p><p>Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.</p><p>Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.</p><p>CNN’s Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.</p><p>Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.</p><p>The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.</p><p>At least 50 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.</p><p>Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.</p><p>The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.</p><h3>Jamaica hardest hit</h3><p>Jamaica took the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/video/jamaica-roads-hurricane-melissa-digivid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:heaviest battering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">heaviest battering</a>.

There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope.

But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.</p><p>In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”</p><p>Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.</p><p>Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.</p><p>North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.</p><p>Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.</p><p>Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>“I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.</p><p>Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/economy/japan-economy-recession-hnk-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:mounting economic woes.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">mounting economic woes.</a></p><p>She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.</p><p>“I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.</p><p>The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warm camaraderie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warm camaraderie</a> showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.</p><p>For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.</p><p>In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”</p><p>“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p><p>Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/04/americas/canada-china-michael-chong-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic rows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic rows</a>.

It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”</p><p>The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F24%2Fpolitics%2Freagan-1987-speech-tariffs-trade-vis&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chelen.regan%40cnn.com%7Cbeabfa0d296b4be7cf0008de19163fa8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638975780735270043%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=P%2Fe9RsYmkNzF5X376vhkZenSvE975vx2FqOmHHGjTZE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan </a>criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.</p><p>CNN’s Joyce Jiang and Yoonjung Seo contributed to this story</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

At worst, it distances the politician from the way the rest of us communicate, Hart said. Think of how stilted Richard Nixon came across when juxtaposed with the cool, calm, collected body language of John F. Kennedy during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:1960 presidential debate.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">1960 presidential debate.</a>&nbsp;(Kennedy would of course go on to win.)</p><p>Stiff body language “is not the case for populist politicians whose gestures seem to be more spontaneous, conversational in style and genuinely charismatic,” Hart said. “They often reflect, albeit in an exaggerated form, the way ordinary people interact. It’s part of the populist playbook.”</p><p>Another high-profile populist pointer, according to Hart? <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/topic/boris-johnson\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Boris Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Boris Johnson</a>, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;No word if <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/donald-trump-s-secret-weapon-boris-style-hair/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unruly, über-blond;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unruly, über-blond</a> hair is part of the populist playbook, too.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-inauguration-body-launguage_n_678e9c9be4b02856224be450?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Body Language Experts Reveal Their Thoughts On Trump&#39;s Major Kiss Fail At The Inauguration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Body Language Experts Reveal Their Thoughts On Trump&#39;s Major Kiss Fail At The Inauguration</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-weird-capitalization-language_n_66f1a9fae4b03a18c4a2602c?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why Does Trump Do That Weird Capitalization Thing?

by the Chinese government.</p><p>China, in response, banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s

commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement, without offering specifics.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Those talks on Friday were &quot;a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on... the introduction and implementation of export

developments on the EU side&quot;, he said.</p><p>The statement did not mention Nexperia specifically.</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>Its chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components, as well as consumer and mobile electronics such as refrigerators.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

Novi Sad (Andrej ISAKOVIC)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Thousands of people gathered in Serbia&#39;s second-largest city Novi Sad on Saturday to commemorate the victims of a fatal railway station roof collapse, marking a year since the tragedy that sparked the biggest protests in decades.</p><p>People placed flowers and candles along temporary fencing near the damaged station entrance, where 16 people were killed when its canopy collapsed on November 1, 2024.</p><p>&quot;I feel ... great pain and sadness,&quot; Svetlana, a 45-year-old woman told AFP, summarising the feeling of mourners who stood in silence.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people are expected to rally for the commemorations that will start at the station at 11:52 am (1052 GMT), the time when the tragedy occurred, with 16 minutes of silence observed for 16 victims.</p><p>Since the tragedy, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption, Serbia has been gripped by regular student-led protests.</p><p>Protesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.</p><p>Students, who called for the &quot;largest commemorative gathering&quot; on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.</p><p>Thousands marched from Belgrade for some 100 kilometres (62 miles), or even from Novi Pazar, around 340 kilometres south of the capital. It took them a symbolic 16 days -- for the 16 victims -- to finish the march.</p><p>Late Friday, residents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.</p><p>&quot;I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now -- our students, our youth,&quot; said Ratko Popovic from the Novi Sad region.</p><p>The 47-year-old, who arrived with his family, praised the &quot;unity of all the people in Serbia who are against corruption, against crime, against the ruling party&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Conscience guides us&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Our conscience is what guides us, it&#39;s what makes us act in this way, to finally bring justice and a better tomorrow to this country,&quot; Luka Kovacevic, medical student from Novi Sad, told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The protests have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the collapse of his government and formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.</p><p>Vucic regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party push conspiracy theories claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.</p><p>But in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.</p><p>&quot;This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed. I apologise for that&quot;, Vucic said and called for a dialogue.</p><p>The government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning while head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) Patriarch Porfirije is to serve a mass for the victims at the Belgrade Saint Sava church.</p><p>Vucic supporters, camping outside the parliament for months against the university blockades in support of the government, said they would gather in front of the church to pay respect to the victims.</p><p>&quot;On this sad anniversary, we appeal to everyone ... to act with restraint, to deescalate tensions and to avoid violence&quot;, the European Union delegation in Serbia said in a statement.</p><p>The protests have remained largely peaceful but in mid-August they degenerated into violence that protesters blamed on heavy-handed tactics by government loyalists and police.</p><p>In September, 13 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic were charged in a criminal case over the collapse.</p><p>A separate anti-corruption probe continues alongside an EU-backed investigation into the possible misuse of EU funds in the project. </p><p>oz-al-ljv/ach</p></div></article></div>",

Their ages range from 16 to 20s.</p><p>Patel <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1984222011158102097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984222011158102097%7Ctwgr%5Efb814abd787b46d2132a2744b5da52a10d9f253a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freep.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmichigan%2F2025%2F10%2F31%2Fterrorist-attack-michigan-fbi-halloween%2F87006356007%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on X</a> the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”</p><p>“The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.</p><h3>How the alleged plot was uncovered</h3><p>The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.</p><p>An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.</p><p>“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.</p><p>The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.</p><p>Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”</p><p>The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.</p><p>There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.</p><h3>‘No current threat to public safety’</h3><p>The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.</p><p>“There is no current threat to public safety.”</p><p>The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”</p><p>“We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.</p><p>In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.</p><p>She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.</p><p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.</p><p>“I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”</p><p>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Nicki Brown and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
