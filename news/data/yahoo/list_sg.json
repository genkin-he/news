Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday, with Israel&#39;s public broadcaster reporting that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been targeted, as the Islamic republic retaliated with barrages of missiles at Gulf states and Israel.</p><p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards, the ideological arm of the Islamic republic, said they had targeted the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, other American interests in the Gulf and Israel.</p><p>Iran&#39;s regionwide missile salvo could be heard in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE, as well as Israel and Iraq, in the hours following the first strikes, after it had repeatedly vowed to retaliate fiercely should it be attacked.</p><p>A strike on a school in Iran killed 24 people, an Iranian provincial official said, while in Israel the army deployed search and rescue teams to multiple locations following reports of fallen projectiles.</p><p>In the UAE, the defence ministry said Iranian strikes had killed one civilian, and witnesses in Dubai heard an explosion and saw missiles streak across the sky.</p><p>Smoke was rising over Tehran&#39;s Pasteur district, site of the home of Khamenei, and there was a huge security deployment in the capital.</p><p>&quot;Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian were among the targets of the attack,&quot; Israel&#39;s Kan reported, citing an Israeli source.</p><p>Iranian state television said Pezeshkian was &quot;safe and sound&quot;, while the Fars news agency said &quot;missile impacts were reported in the Keshvardoost and Pasteur districts&quot; of Tehran.</p><p>Witnesses told AFP correspondents they had heard at least three blasts in the area. AFP journalists also saw long lines of people queueing at bakeries at various locations in Tehran.</p><p>The attacks came after US President Donald Trump expressed frustration at Iran&#39;s stance in negotiations over its nuclear and missile programmes.</p><p>Trump said Washington&#39;s goal was &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot; from Iran, and Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation was to remove an &quot;existential threat&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;The United States&#39; military began major combat operations in Iran,&quot; Trump said in a video message posted on his social media site while he spent the weekend at his Florida golf club.</p><p>- Totally &#39;obliterated&#39; -</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We&#39;re going to annihilate their navy,&quot; Trump said, warning of &nbsp;possible US casualties.</p><p>He offered Iranian forces including the Revolutionary Guards &quot;immunity&quot; should they surrender, or &quot;certain death&quot; if not, and told Iranians the &quot;hour of your freedom is at hand&quot;, urging them to rise up and &quot;take over your government&quot;.</p><p>Israel&#39;s Netanyahu echoed this call, telling Iranians that the time had come to &quot;cast off the yoke of tyranny&quot;.</p><p>The Israeli army warned Iranians in or around military infrastructure across Iran to evacuate after announcing it was conducting a &quot;broad strike&quot; on multiple military targets.</p><p>Iran again vowed to &quot;respond decisively to the aggressors&quot;, and the Guards announced they had targeted the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain as well as targets in Israel.</p><p>&quot;The IRGC&#39;s missiles and drones have struck the headquarters of the US Navy&#39;s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and other American bases in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as military and security centres in the heart of the occupied territories, with severe blows,&quot; the Guards said.</p><p>&quot;I saw with my own eyes two Tomahawk missiles flying horizontally toward targets,&quot; a Tehran office worker told AFP on condition of anonymity. &quot;At first we heard a dull noise and thought it was a fighter jet.&quot;</p><p>Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, the UAE and Israel all closed their airspaces to civilian traffic, at least in part, and multiple airlines cancelled flights to the Middle East. US embassies in the Gulf urged American citizens to take shelter.</p><p>- Blasts and sirens -</p><p>Explosions were also heard over central Doha and near Al-Udeid military base, the largest US facility in the region, and an AFP journalist saw an interceptor take out one missile in a puff of white smoke, as Qatar&#39;s defence ministry said it had &quot;repelled a number of attacks&quot;.</p><p>Kuwait and the UAE also reported intercepting incoming Iranian missiles, with Abu Dhabi saying it &quot;reserves its full right to respond&quot; and slamming the attacks as &quot;a dangerous escalation&quot;.</p><p>A bombing that targeted an Iraqi military base housing a pro-Iran group killed at least two fighters, sources from the powerful group Kataeb Hezbollah told AFP.</p><p>&quot;We will soon begin attacking American bases in response to their aggression,&quot; the group said.</p><p>With the strikes underway, the exiled son of Iran&#39;s last shah voiced confidence in victory against the Islamic republic.</p><p>&quot;We are very close to final victory. I want to be by your side as soon as possible so that together we can take back and rebuild Iran,&quot; Reza Pahlavi, who lives in the Washington area, said in an online video address.</p><p>burs/dc-smw/ser/dc</p></div></article></div>",

Trump appears hopeful his major air operation can successfully result in a change in Iran’s regime, despite the vast uncertainties about what might replace it and the limited historical examples of air power alone ousting a country’s leader.</p><p>“They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” said Trump, who a US official said is continuing to monitor the strikes from Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The president reached his decision after weeks of deliberation and an attempt by his envoys to strike a rapid diplomatic agreement that would have forced Iran to abandon long-held red lines. The US military is planning for several days of attacks, two sources told CNN, and Iran has already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm659xol00013b6pvcmz6t8r&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:retaliated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">retaliated</a> across the Middle East, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm64h9ax00003b6rj3zp8g0k&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:targeting the US Navy base in Bahrain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">targeting the US Navy base in Bahrain</a> that is home to the Fifth Fleet, a US official said.</p><p>Trump never fully publicly laid out his case for war, even during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, despite strikes being a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/politics/donald-trump-dilemma-iran?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:politically perilous move;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">politically perilous move</a> at home, especially for a president who campaigned on ending foreign entanglements. He noted on Saturday the potential cost to American lives.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“The Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties — that often happens in war — but we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission,” the president said, adding that US had “taken every possible step to minimize the risk to US personnel in the region.”</p><p>To many of Trump’s allies, military action had long appeared inevitable. After telling Iranian protesters at the start of the year that he would come to their support, warning the US was “locked and loaded” to attack, he felt obligated to enforce his red line.</p><p>“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump told the Iranian people in his video.</p><p>“For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want, so let’s see how you respond,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s motivations for his second set of strikes within Iran since returning to office — conveyed mostly in curt, off-hand public remarks — appeared to shift over time, moving from protecting protesters to curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions to ousting the Iranian regime. He’s also cited Iran’s arsenal of missiles and destabilizing support for regional proxy groups, like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p><p>How the latest military action from both the US and Israel advances all, or any, of those objectives remains to be seen. Nor was it clear what the president has been told to expect in the aftermath.</p><p>Behind the scenes ahead of the strikes, officials wrestled with a slate of imperfect options that all stopped short of a decisive mission like the one Trump ordered in January to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas. US intelligence is uncertain on who would replace Iran’s senior leaders if they are taken out.</p><p>Military officials have also warned the president about the steep risks for retaliation. Thousands of American troops based in the Middle East could now potentially be targets for Iran as it carries out promised reprisals.</p><p>During intense Situation Room meetings over the last several weeks, Trump and senior officials peppered top Pentagon brass, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/caine-iran-hegseth-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gen. Dan Caine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gen. Dan Caine</a>, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with questions about each options’ likelihood of success. The answers were often inconclusive, even as Trump ordered a massive military buildup in the Middle East.</p><p>In his vague public remarks leading up to the strikes, Trump issued threats <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/27/politics/iran-missiles-trump-intelligence-nuclear?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not backed by US intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not backed by US intelligence</a> — including that Iran would soon have a missile that can hit the US.</p><p>“They should make a deal, but they don’t want to quite go far enough,” he said Friday during a stop in Texas. “They don’t want to say the key words: ‘We’re not going to have a nuclear weapon.’”</p><p>Yet if Iran’s words alone were the bar for avoiding conflict, the hurdle had already been cleared. The country has repeatedly said it is not pursuing nuclear weapons, including this week.</p><p>There are many reasons to question that claim, including Iran’s previous enrichment of uranium to near-weapons grade. But Trump’s emphasis on the country’s words alone only seemed to raise more questions about what, precisely, he was looking for in a deal with the country’s leaders.</p><p>He allowed diplomacy to proceed, despite warnings from some senior officials that Iran was notoriously difficult to negotiate with. Some questioned whether Iran’s Supreme Leader, who has ultimate sign-off, would agree to any of Trump’s terms — even if his negotiators seemed more willing to negotiate.</p><p>Many inside Trump’s orbit encouraged him to pursue a deal. His envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who engaged in three rounds of indirect talks with the Iranians, entered the discussions with guarded hopes for success.</p><p>But others were less encouraging. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham publicly scoffed at some reported concessions offered by the Iranians. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an urgent visit to Washington this month, said there would unlikely be a more opportune moment to strike Iran.</p><p>Throughout, Trump had appeared to people around him wary of taking the country to war, far preferring a diplomatic outcome that he could sell as stronger than the Obama-era nuclear deal he withdrew from. But he was impatient for an agreement, setting short timelines that did not yield the concessions he was seeking from Tehran.</p><p>In ordering the strikes, Trump overcame certain misgivings at launching an operation his military advisers warned could have an uncertain outcome and could prompt outsized retaliation by Tehran.</p><p>And the new operation — which follows limited US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities last June — poses significant political risk for a president whose base has opposed foreign wars. In all, Trump has used the US military to target sites in more than than a half-dozen countries in his second term. It’s not clear how long this operation may last or cost, either in terms of money or lives.</p><p>In an interview this week, Vice President JD Vance — who has previously warned about sending US troops into harm’s way for uncertain purposes — suggested any operation in Iran would not result in a prolonged conflict akin to the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p><p>“I do think we have to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. I also think that we have to avoid overlearning the lessons of the past,” he told the Washington Post. “Just because one president screwed up a military conflict doesn’t mean we can never engage in military conflict again. We’ve got to be careful about it, but I think the president is being careful.”</p><p>Trump acknowledged the risk of a prolonged conflict in his own assessment on Friday. “I guess you could say there’s always a risk. You know, when there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

who are lawfully in the US from being arrested and deported, saying a Trump administration policy turns the “American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”</p><p>US District Judge John Tunheim granted a motion by advocates for refugees to convert a temporary restraining order that he issued in January into a more permanent preliminary injunction while the case develops further.</p><p>The order applies only in Minnesota. But the implications of a new national policy on refugees that the Department of Homeland Security announced February 18 were a major part of the discussion at a hearing held by the judge the next day.</p><p>“Minnesota refugees can now live their lives without fear that their own government will snatch them off the street and imprison them far from loved ones,” Kimberly Grano, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told The Associated Press.</p><p>The Trump administration asserts it has the right to arrest potentially tens of thousands of refugees across the US who entered the country legally but don’t yet have green cards. A new Homeland Security memo interprets immigration law to say that refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. so that their applications can be reviewed.</p><p>The judge, however, expressed disbelief in a 66-page opinion.</p><p>“This Court will not allow federal authorities to use a new and erroneous statutory interpretation to terrorize refugees who immigrated to this country under the promise that they would be welcomed and allowed to live in peace, far from the persecution they fled,” Tunheim said.</p><p>He said the US decades ago promised refugees fleeing persecution that they could build a new life after rigorous background checks.</p><p>“We promised them the hope that one day they could achieve the American Dream,” Tunheim said. “The Government’s new policy breaks that promise — without congressional authorization — and raises serious constitutional concerns. The new policy turns the refugees’ American Dream into a dystopian nightmare.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Homeland Security and US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement Friday night that the ruling was “yet another lawless and activist order from a federal judge” and that the Trump administration expected to be “vindicated in court.”</p><p>“USCIS is committed to rooting out fraud and protecting the public safety and national security interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens,” the statement said.</p><p>Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during a court hearing last week that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but he also indicated that would not always happen.</p><p>The judge noted that one refugee in the case, identified as D. Doe, was arrested in January after being told that someone had struck his car.</p><p>“He was immediately flown to Texas, where he was interrogated about his refugee status. He was kept in ‘shackles and handcuffs’ for sixteen hours. D. Doe was ultimately released on the streets of Texas, left to find his way back to Minnesota,” Tunheim said.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Suffice it to say that it’s a threat. We can see that it’s possible.”</p><p>“Beyond just the nuclear program they possess these conventional weapons that are solely designed to attack America and attack Americans, if they so choose to do so. These things have to be addressed,” the top US diplomat said.</p><p>On the nuclear program, Rubio acknowledged that Iran is “not enriching right now,” but said “they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can.”</p><p>However, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff – one of two main US negotiators – claimed in an interview released last Saturday that Iran was “probably a week away from having industrial-grade bombmaking material.” That claim came despite the Trump administration’s repeated assertions that the US had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program in military strikes last year.</p><p>According to a source, intelligence shows that Iran is actively trying to build back its enrichment capability, including installing additional centrifuges, getting back online centrifuges that survived military strikes last year, and rebuilding facilities - many of which were damaged or destroyed - needed to weaponize the enriched uranium.</p><p>However, sources and experts say that work would take far longer than a week. And, according to a source, the work to build back the nuclear program is happening in places that are not likely to be impacted by military strikes.</p><p><em>CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

leader Ali Khamenei, a pillar of its theocratic system since the Islamic revolution, has seen off a succession of crises throughout his rule with a mixture of repression and strategic manoeuvring but now could be facing his biggest challenge.</p><p>The United States and Israel launched strikes against targets in Iranian cities on Saturday, sparking a swift response from the Islamic republic whose Guards announced the launch of a wave of missile and drone attacks at Israel.</p><p>While the scope of the attack on Iran remains to be seen, it could range from the limited to targeting the very apex of the leadership.</p><p>Khamenei, now 86, has dominated Iran for the last three-and-a-half decades since taking on the post for life in 1989 as leader of the Islamic revolution following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>He has remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections, and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.</p><p>He also survived the 2022-2023 &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.</p><p>Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the 12-day war against Israel in June, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.</p><p>But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook the Islamic republic earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.</p><p>- Tight security -</p><p>Khamenei lives under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances are never announced in advance or broadcast live.</p><p>As supreme leader he never sets foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There has long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s right arm is always inert. It was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 authorities have always blamed on the People&#39;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.</p><p>- &#39;I am opposed&#39; -</p><p>Repeatedly arrested under the shah for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei shortly after the Islamic revolution became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the frontline during the Iran-Iraq war.</p><p>He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.</p><p>During the 1980s, Khomeini&#39;s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.</p><p>When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic&#39;s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts met, it was Khamenei who they chose as leader.</p><p>Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, &quot;I am opposed&quot;.&nbsp;But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power has not slackened since.</p><p>Khamenei has now worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures like Mohammad Khatami who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.</p><p>But in the end, Khamenei has always come down on the side of hardliners.</p><p>He is believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, has public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.</p><p>A family dispute has also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><p>Some of their children, including a nephew who is now in France, have become vehement critics.</p><p>sjw/ser</p></div></article></div>",

major attack alongside Israel against Iran, US President Donald Trump is pursuing the goal he once adamantly rejected -- regime change.</p><p>Trump, who has ordered a military buildup in the Middle East unseen since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, made clear in a video address that his goal was to remove the cleric-run state that has long been a US nemesis.</p><p>Trump, who had publicly suggested for weeks a more limited goal of forcing a deal on Iran to end its nuclear program, said that Iran&#39;s missiles will be &quot;obliterated&quot; and said the United States would &quot;annihilate&quot; the Iranian navy.</p><p>Speaking to Iranians, Trump said: &quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This will be, probably, your only chance for generations,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>Indicating coordination, the son of Iran&#39;s late pro-Western shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution, released his own address in which he called for Iranians to wait -- and then seize power.</p><p>&quot;Stay vigilant and ready so that, at the appropriate time -- which I will announce to you precisely -- you can return to the streets for the final action,&quot; said Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the Washington area.</p><p>Trump himself had long criticized US attempts to remake the Middle East.</p><p>In a speech last year in Riyadh, Trump denounced previous US policymakers as failures for seeking to install new systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>&quot;In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,&quot; Trump said in his speech.</p><p>Trump&#39;s close advisor Stephen Miller, in social media posts during the 2024 election, had cast rival Kamala Harris as a warmonger and said &quot;millions die&quot; if she becomes president.</p><p>&quot;Trump said warmongering neocons love sending your kids to die for wars they would never fight themselves,&quot; Miller wrote, posting: &quot;Kamala = WWIII.

sites, and urging Iranians to overthrow their government.</p><p>In a video address after the United States and Israel started bombing Iran, Trump made clear the goal was destruction of the Islamic republic&#39;s military and toppling of the authorities in power since the 1979 revolution.</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally -- again -- obliterated. We&#39;re going to annihilate their navy,&quot; Trump said in the address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.</p><p>He urged opponents of the Iranian authorities to rise up, saying &quot;the hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take,&quot; Trump said. This &quot;will be probably your only chance for generations.&quot;</p><p>But in a section of the short speech that was aimed at the US public, Trump acknowledged that &quot;the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost&quot; in what the Pentagon dubbed &quot;Operation Epic Fury.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We may have casualties,&quot; Trump warned.</p><p>Any loss of life on the US side would be politically hazardous for Trump himself, especially after his refusal to seek approval for war against Iran from Congress -- and his own lengthy record of opposing foreign interventions.</p><p>A one-day raid to oust the former strongman leader of Venezuela in January was accomplished without US fatalities. Surgical air strikes on Iran&#39;s main nuclear sites last June also went off without US losses.</p><p>- Bombs &#39;dropping everywhere&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Operation Epic Fury&quot; is on an entirely different scale militarily and politically.</p><p>An attack was widely expected after Trump ordered the biggest military deployment to the Middle East in years. But critical lawmakers have for days been asking why Trump has not addressed the US public or Congress to explain the need for war.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump&#39;s video appeared without warning on his Truth Social site at 2:30 am in Florida, where he was spending the weekend at his luxury golf club.</p><p>Trump, wearing a white baseball cap marked &quot;USA&quot; and no tie with his white shirt and dark jacket, stood at a podium between two flags against a black background.</p><p>He sought to justify the assault on Iran saying: &quot;Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas and could soon reach the American homeland,&quot; he said.</p><p>He urged Iranian forces to surrender, including the elite Revolutionary Guards that is tasked with safeguarding the cleric-run government.</p><p>&quot;To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces, and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity or in the alternative, face certain death.&quot;</p><p>But Trump warned ordinary Iranians that the US bombing would be large-scale.</p><p>&quot;Stay sheltered. Don&#39;t leave your home. It&#39;s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere.&quot;</p><p>Trump on Friday insisted that he had not decided whether to attack, and his envoys on Thursday held talks with Iran&#39;s top diplomat toward a deal on concerns led by Tehran&#39;s nuclear program.</p><p>The top diplomat of Oman, which mediated talks Thursday in Geneva between the United States and Iran, had been optimistic for a compromise.</p><p>He met Friday with US Vice President JD Vance and told CBS News that Iran had agreed to zero stockpiling of enriched uranium that could build an atomic bomb, a goal denied by Tehran.</p><p>bur-sms/jfx</p></div></article></div>",
