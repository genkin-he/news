His religious commitment was clear when he became a cleric at the age of 11. He studied in Iraq and in Qom, Iran’s religious capital.</p><p>His father, a religious scholar of ethnic Azeri descent, was a traditionalist cleric opposed to mixing religion and politics. In contrast, his son embraced the Islamist revolutionary cause.</p><p>“He (<span>Khamenei</span>’s father) came across as a modernist or progressive cleric,” said Mahmoud Moradkhani, a nephew who opposes<span>&nbsp;Khamenei</span>’s rule and lives in exile. Unlike his son, “he was not a part of the fundamentalists”, Moradkhani said.</p><p>In 1963,<span>&nbsp;Khamenei&nbsp;</span>served the first of many terms in prison when at 24 he was detained for political activities. Later that year he was imprisoned for 10 days in Mashhad, where he underwent severe torture, according to his official biography.</p><p>After the shah’s fall,<span>&nbsp;Khamenei&nbsp;</span>took up several posts in the Islamic Republic. As deputy minister of defence, he became close to the military and was a key figure in the 1980-88 war with neighbouring Iraq, which claimed an estimated total of one million lives.</p><p>A skilled orator, he was appointed by Khomeini as a Friday prayer leader in Tehran.</p><p>There were questions about his rapid, unprecedented rise. He won the presidency with Khomeini’s support - the first cleric in the post - and was a surprise choice as Khomeini’s successor, given that he lacked both Khomeini’s popular appeal and superior clerical credentials.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 437px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:69%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei makes a speech in Tehran, Iran, on November 3, 2025.

That year, the force crushed protests after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won re-election amid opposition accusations of vote fraud.</p><p>He also presided over a vast financial empire through Setad, an organisation founded by Khomeini but expanded hugely under<span>&nbsp;Khamenei</span>, with assets worth tens of billions of dollars.</p><p><span>Khamenei&nbsp;</span>expanded Iranian influence in the region, empowering Shi’ite militias in Iraq and Lebanon, and propping up then-President Bashar al-Assad by deploying thousands of soldiers to Syria.</p><p>He spent billions over four decades on these allies - the “Axis of Resistance”, which also included Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group, and Yemen’s Houthis - to oppose Israeli and U.S. power in the Middle East.</p><p>But in 2024<span>&nbsp;Khamenei&nbsp;</span>saw these alliances unravel, and Iran’s regional influence shrivel, with the ousting of Assad and a series of defeats inflicted by Israel on Hezbollah in Lebanon and on Hamas in Gaza, including the killing of their leaders.</p><p>Under<span>&nbsp;Khamenei</span>’s rule, Iran and Israel fought a shadow war for years, with Israel assassinating Tehran’s nuclear scientists and Revolutionary Guard commanders.</p><p>It exploded into the open during Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza from 2023. In April 2024, Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel after it bombed Tehran’s embassy compound in Damascus. Israel struck Iranian soil in response.</p><p>But that was only a prelude to June 2025, when Israel’s military unleashed hundreds of fighter jets to strike Iranian nuclear and military targets as well as senior personnel. The surprise attack provoked a barrage of missiles in both directions, transforming simmering conflict into all-out war. The U.S. joined the air offensive on Iran, which lasted 12 days.</p><p>The U.S. and Israel had warned they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and, on Saturday, they launched the most ambitious attack on Iranian targets in decades.</p><p>Negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials took place as recently as Thursday, but senior U.S. officials said that Iran had not been willing to give up its ability to enrich uranium, which the Iranians argued they wanted for nuclear energy but U.S. officials said would enable the country to build a nuclear bomb.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Smoke rises on the skyline after an explosion in Tehran, Iran, Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026.

FALEH)</figcaption></div></figure><p>As a fresh Middle East conflict risks sending oil prices sharply higher, Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance are widely expected to announce an output increase Sunday, analysts say.</p><p>The virtual meeting by the eight members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied nations (OPEC+) known as the &quot;Voluntary Eight&quot; (V8) comes a day after the US and Israel launched an ongoing wave of strikes on Iran.</p><p>Last year, the V8 group -- comprising Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman -- boosted production by around 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in total before announcing a three-month pause in output hikes.</p><p>But now the picture has changed dramatically.</p><p>Even before the conflict erupted on Saturday, the market had already priced in a growing geopolitical risk premium over months of US military build-up in the region.</p><p>Brent, the global benchmark for crude oil, jumped more than three percent on Friday to trade over $73 per barrel, up from $61 at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Several other developments have squeezed oil supply since early January, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.</p><p>They include &quot;cold weather in the US across January (that) resulted in temporarily production shut-ins&quot;, &quot;disruptions in Russia&quot; linked to drone attacks, as well as in Kazakhstan, where &quot;a power outage disrupted production from the Tengiz oil field&quot;,&nbsp;he added.</p><p>That&#39;s why, even before Saturday&#39;s strikes, the market was anticipating a quota increase of 137,000 barrels per day.</p><p>&quot;These relatively high prices are a good incentive for OPEC+ to resume its production increases&quot; from April, Kpler analyst Homayoun Falakshahi told AFP.</p><p>Before the weekend, Falakshahi said a US strike on Iran would not necessarily alter the OPEC+ decision, as the group might prefer to wait and assess the impact on flows before adding more oil to the market than previously planned.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- Iran tensions -</p><p>In the short term, the US attack will likely trigger &quot;a massive surge in prices&quot; with what follows depending on how far the conflict escalates, Falakshahi said.</p><p>The conflict could certainly severely disrupt global oil supplies and send barrel prices soaring to a level not seen in years.</p><p>Iran is a significant oil producer, but the principal risk remains a prolonged blockade of the Straits of Hormuz, through which around 20 million barrels of crude pass each day -- around 20 percent of global production.</p><p>And there are virtually no alternatives for crude transport.</p><p>Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE have pipeline networks, capable of carrying a maximum of 2.6 million barrels per day, that allow them to bypass the Straits of Hormuz, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p>&quot;That said, even if strikes remain limited, we think Brent crude oil prices might rise to about $80pb (around their peak during the 12-day war in June 2025), from $73pb yesterday&quot;, wrote William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>But prices would rise much more if the conflict is a prolonged one, particularly if the Strait of Hormuz is blocked for an extended period.</p><p>&quot;That could cause oil prices to jump, perhaps to around $100pb,&quot; said Jackson.</p><p>- Limited impact -</p><p>Even if OPEC+ agrees on an output increase of 137,000 barrels per day on Sunday, the impact on oil prices will be limited, especially since the hike would only translate into an actual increase of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels, according to Kpler estimates.</p><p>&quot;Spare capacity is much smaller than some perceive, and primarily in the hands of Saudi Arabia,&quot; Staunovo told AFP, adding that Russian production had been &quot;on a declining trend over the last two months&quot;.</p><p>Boosting production would nevertheless allow OPEC+ members to regain market share in the face of competition from other key players such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Guyana.</p><p>&quot;OPEC+ would prefer prices of $80-90, but around $70 per barrel is the ideal price level for this strategy&quot; because it is &quot;not enough to encourage further investment by US producers but acceptable for OPEC+,&quot; Falakshahi said.</p><p>pml-kym/rl/db-jj/ane</p></div></article></div>",

In 1953, Mohammad Mossadegh, a secular, democratically elected prime minister, was overthrown in an Iranian army coup backed by the CIA and British intelligence after he nationalized the country’s oil industry. That event restored Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the throne and, after the monarch was deposed in the 1979 Islamic revolution, played a central role in the Islamic Republic’s anti-US narrative. It regularly cited by Khamenei as a symbol of US imperialism and the reason for his distrust of the West.</p><p>Iran is home to a diverse population of more than 90 million, including Persians, Azeris, Arabs, Baloch and Kurds. Under Khamenei’s decades-long rule, the Islamic Republic largely managed to contain civil and ethnic unrest.</p><p>But with no clear successor, his death would raise serious concerns about the stability of Iran, as well as the wider region, with potential consequences for the global economy.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Iran&#39;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran on March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hc8Q8tf2JR_eqg7s6VXPjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f96df22f7860c314f021573b4243af51><noscript><img alt=\"Iran&#39;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran on March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hc8Q8tf2JR_eqg7s6VXPjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f96df22f7860c314f021573b4243af51 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran on March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

the central aspect of the 73-year-old&#39;s legacy.</p><p>The Kremlin leader hopes victory will place him alongside the likes of Peter the Great in the pantheon of Russia&#39;s most consequential leaders.</p><p>For him, it is existential.</p><p>&quot;Russia is fighting for its future, for independence, for truth and justice,&quot; Putin said in a Kremlin ceremony honouring Russian soldiers in February.</p><p>That narrative has been largely rubbished in the West and Kyiv, which see the offensive as a brutal, imperialistic land grab.</p><p>Putin&#39;s uncompromising approach to the war is

Russia was hit with sanctions and kicked out of the G8.</p><p>Any goodwill left was obliterated by Putin&#39;s decision to launch a full-scale offensive on Ukraine on February 24, 2022.</p><p>Four years and hundreds of thousands of deaths into a war he hoped would last a few days, the conflict has consumed Putin.</p><p>&quot;This is going to end up being the defining element of his presidency, whether the war drags on or whether it ends this year,&quot; British historian and long-time Putin watcher Mark Galeotti told AFP.</p><p>Putin has come to see it as one front in a civilisational struggle between Russia and the West.</p><p>&quot;The Western globalist elites,&quot; he said in 2023, are &quot;provoking bloody conflicts and coups, sowing hatred, Russophobia and aggressive nationalism, destroying family and traditional values.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Using&#39; people -</p><p>Born in post-war Leningrad -- now Saint Petersburg -- Putin trained as a lawyer and then joined the KGB spy service, which despatched him to East Germany in the 1980s.</p><p>When the Berlin Wall came down and crowds marched on his Dresden field office, he was shovelling confidential documents into a furnace. Moscow, he recalled, &quot;was silent&quot;.</p><p>The collapse of the Soviet Union deeply affected him.</p><p>Returning to his hometown amid the chaos of the post-Soviet era, he rose through the ranks of the city administration as a &quot;colourless&quot; official, journalist M. Gessen recounted in a biography titled &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot;.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s not especially charismatic,&quot; Galeotti said. But he has a &quot;particular skill&quot; for &quot;using&quot; people, he added.</p><p>Putin&#39;s private life is just one of the topics that is off-limits inside Russia.</p><p>Officially, he is divorced with two daughters -- trained scientists who hold senior positions in state-linked organisations.</p><p>But he is widely reported to be in a relationship with 42-year-old former Olympic gymnastic champion Alina Kabaeva. Rumours of other children abound in independent and international media.</p><p>He has never commented.</p><p>Asked during his annual phone-in show in December 2025 whether he was &quot;in love&quot;, Putin responded with a single word: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>bur/st</p></div></article></div>",

leader Ali Khamenei, whose death was confirmed by state media on Sunday, was a pillar of the country&#39;s theocratic system since the Islamic revolution and saw off multiple crises over the decades, remaining defiant to the very end.</p><p>US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social site that &quot;Khamenei, one of the most evil people in history, is dead&quot; after the United States and Israel launched a massive wave of strikes targeting sites across Iran, including the supreme leader&#39;s Tehran compound.</p><p>Hours later, Iranian state television announced Khamenei&#39;s death, without referring to the attacks on the compound.</p><p>Aged 86, Khamenei dominated Iran since taking on the post for life in 1989 following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.</p><p>He also survived the 2022-2023 &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.</p><p>Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the 12-day war against Israel in June, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.</p><p>But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.</p><p>- Tight security -</p><p>Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live.</p><p>As supreme leader, he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by his predecessor Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There had long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People&#39;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.</p><p>- &#39;I am opposed&#39; -</p><p>Repeatedly arrested under the shah for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei shortly after the Islamic revolution became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war.</p><p>He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.</p><p>During the 1980s, Khomeini&#39;s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.</p><p>When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic&#39;s top clerical body -- the Assembly of Experts -- met, it was Khamenei they chose as leader.</p><p>Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, &quot;I am opposed&quot;.&nbsp;But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power never slackened.</p><p>Khamenei worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures such as Mohammad Khatami who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.</p><p>But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners.</p><p>He was believed to have six children, although only one, Mojtaba, gained public prominence. He was placed under US sanctions in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.</p><p>A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><p>Some of their children, including a nephew who is now in France, became vehement critics.</p><p>sjw/hmn/lb</p></div></article></div>",

After he became his country’s top political and religious authority following the death of the previous supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, Iran avoided major direct attacks from its adversaries for more than three decades — even as other regional foes of the United States and Israel fell one by one. The regime entrenched itself with the formation of the “Axis of Resistance,” a loose network of allied groups spread throughout the region that allowed Tehran to project power at its enemies’ doorstep.</p><p>But all that — along with the aura of fear and intimidation that Khamenei carefully cultivated — began to unravel in his final years.

Israel launched a devastating war on Hamas, then turned its sights on Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of Iran’s most prized proxies. Israeli forces later moved into Syria following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Emboldened by a string of battlefield successes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “finish the job,” culminating in a bold and unprecedented strike on Iran itself in June 2025, ostensibly to dismantle its nuclear program and its ability to defend itself. The Israeli strikes ultimately drew in the US, which struck three Iranian nuclear sites in the final days of the war.

He was an activist before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, helping to organize protests against the shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and serving time in prison for it.</p><p>He was also a target for the new Islamic regime’s opponents and escaped an assassination attempt in 1981 that left his right arm useless.</p><p>Not long afterward, he was elected president on a platform deeply hostile to the West and its liberal ideology, and especially to the United States — threatening a hard fight in the event of war.</p><p>“We in no way are willing to start an all-out war with the US, but if it so happens, we will inevitably put up a very strong defense,” he said.</p><p>He was a protégé of Khomeini, who led the struggle to overthrow the shah and founded the Islamic Republic. When Khomeini died in 1989, Khamenei became his successor within a matter of weeks.</p><p>While lacking Khomeini’s theological standing, Khamenei proved to be politically shrewd. Over time, he consolidated control over Iran’s armed forces, intelligence services, judiciary and state media to ensure that no major decision could be made without his approval.</p><h3>The nuclear deterrence that backfired</h3><p>It was Khamenei’s advancement of Iran’s nuclear program that ultimately led to the attacks on Iran by Israel and the US.</p><p>Though he repeatedly claimed the program was for peaceful purposes — and even issued a religious decree, or fatwa, proclaiming that nuclear weapons were forbidden by Islam — he steadfastly supported the development of nuclear energy as a matter of national sovereignty and strategic leverage.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Khamenei looks at an Iranian missile during the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023. - Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GjT2tKsEUGDjoiubLLZaVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9828384407204e0dd9907a536b79eacd><noscript><img alt=\"Khamenei looks at an Iranian missile during the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023. - Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GjT2tKsEUGDjoiubLLZaVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9828384407204e0dd9907a536b79eacd class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Khamenei looks at an Iranian missile during the IRGC Aerospace Force achievements exhibition in Tehran, Iran November 19, 2023. - Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>By the time Hassan Rouhani, a centrist politician, succeeded hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president in 2013, the nuclear showdown with the West had turned into Iran’s biggest foreign policy challenge. With Khamenei’s approval, Rouhani’s administration negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) with world powers, including the US. The deal was meant to free the Iranian economy from years of crippling sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program, notably its enrichment of uranium.</p><p>But Khamenei remained skeptical. His reluctance to fully embrace the deal contributed to its fragility. When Trump unilaterally exited the agreement in 2018, Iran continued to abide by it. But a year later, Tehran said it would no longer be bound by its commitments if the other parties to the JCPOA were in breach of theirs.</p><p>Khamenei seized the moment to accelerate uranium enrichment and leaned ever further into a “resistance economy” doctrine — emphasizing self-sufficiency and confrontation over compromise.</p><p>In late June 2019, new US sanctions were imposed on Khamenei himself, as well as his office, to block Iran’s access to the international finance system. Trump’s punitive “maximum pressure” policy crippled Iran’s economy and effectively denied its people the nuclear pact’s promised benefits.</p><p>The election of reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian in 2024 on a platform of reengaging with the world and resolving Iran’s nuclear standoff brought hope of reinvigorating Iran’s economy and reintegrating the Islamic Republic into the international community. Talks resumed with the US a year later, but hopes of reaching a detente with the West were crushed by Israel’s attack on Iran in the middle of those talks, as it sought to capitalize on its military gains after the October 7 attacks.</p><p>Eight months later, Iran and the US began another round of indirect talks, mediated by Oman. Despite engaging with Tehran, the Trump administration started the biggest American military buildup in the Middle East in over two decades. Trump sent mixed signals, saying talks had been going well, while advocating regime change in Iran.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election in Tehran, Iran, on July 5, 2024. - Vahid Salemi/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QAQB85bWTT.YXEeiVO5BZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/53005d0dc02ed0a4fa711fd0f34bd7ce><noscript><img alt=\"Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election in Tehran, Iran, on July 5, 2024. - Vahid Salemi/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QAQB85bWTT.YXEeiVO5BZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/53005d0dc02ed0a4fa711fd0f34bd7ce class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election in Tehran, Iran, on July 5, 2024. - Vahid Salemi/AP</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Projecting power through proxies</h3><p>While Iran always denied any involvement in or prior knowledge of the October 7 attacks by Hamas and allied militias, the assault and the seismic regional events it triggered had major implications for a key pillar of Khamenei’s legacy: a reliance on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxy groups it supported to project power beyond Iran’s borders.</p><p>Under Khamenei, Iran’s influence extended into Iraq after Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003. In the following years, Tehran also became a major player in regional conflicts, including Syria’s civil war, where IRGC forces were at the forefront of operations.</p><p>The IRGC, which reported directly to Khamenei, became the most powerful military institution in Iran, holding deep influence over domestic politics and the economy. It also wielded huge influence over key armed groups elsewhere in the region, such as Lebanon’s once formidable Hezbollah, Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen and several armed Shiite groups in Iraq and Syria. In 2019, the US added the IRGC to its list of designated terrorist groups in an unprecedented move against another country’s armed forces.</p><p>In the 2010s, as the threat from the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group grew, so did Iran’s involvement in neighboring Arab countries. Many Shiite Muslims saw ISIS as an existential threat, and while Iranian-backed militias had some success in pushing back the group, their campaigns also deepened regional sectarian tensions.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Khamenei (center) flanked by member of the Supreme Defense Council reviews the troops in 1987 in Tehran. - IRNA/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/muTVRpOTw2zErhFUry6j_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3ddc24d79962bfe9fd89fd3d6f0cf4dc><noscript><img alt=\"Khamenei (center) flanked by member of the Supreme Defense Council reviews the troops in 1987 in Tehran. - IRNA/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/muTVRpOTw2zErhFUry6j_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3ddc24d79962bfe9fd89fd3d6f0cf4dc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Khamenei (center) flanked by member of the Supreme Defense Council reviews the troops in 1987 in Tehran. - IRNA/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Sunni Muslims often viewed the fight not just as a battle against terrorism, but as an Iranian-led war on their sect. Powerful Arab states in the Persian Gulf saw Iran’s moves as part of a broader effort to expand a “Shiite Crescent” across the region, heightening fears of unrest at home. By the mid-2010s, several Arab states in the gulf had severed diplomatic ties with Tehran.</p><p>Khamenei didn’t back away, instead doubling down on support for Iran’s proxies. ISIS was eventually crushed by a multinational coalition in 2019, and Iran’s regional influence solidified. A battered Syria turned into a key staging ground for the IRGC, placing Iranian forces and allies right at Israel’s doorstep. In time, Saudi Arabia restored ties with Iran through secret, Chinese-brokered talks, and other gulf states soon followed. By then, Iran had managed to improve relations with several neighbors. Despite crippling sanctions, it appeared strategically ascendant — its regional reach more secure than ever.</p><p>That strategic depth was dismantled bit by bit by Israel after the October 7 attacks. With its proxies crippled, Iran became vulnerable and finally itself became a target of both Israel and the US. After that 12-day war in June, Tehran was left with little negotiating leverage, its nuclear facilities heavily damaged, its proxies nearly neutralized and its economy in tatters.</p><h3>Opposition to reform</h3><p>Iran saw repeated pushes for reform during Khamenei’s rule, and repeated crackdowns on those efforts. He worked to contain the reformist movement of President Mohammad Khatami in the late 1990s and backed the brutal suppression of protests that erupted amid claims that the 2009 elections had been rigged in favor of the hard-line Ahmadinejad.</p><p>Khamenei’s public backing of Ahmadinejad and the subsequent crackdown cemented his image as a leader intolerant of dissent and reluctant to change.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Khamenei in Iran&#39;s capital Tehran on April 19, 2015. - Iranian Religious Leader Press Office/Anadolu/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5z7XW5m7hHnRYdl9UcnrBg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1bf717119a7f249a6c6ab0912be7b14><noscript><img alt=\"Khamenei in Iran&#39;s capital Tehran on April 19, 2015. - Iranian Religious Leader Press Office/Anadolu/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5z7XW5m7hHnRYdl9UcnrBg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1bf717119a7f249a6c6ab0912be7b14 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Khamenei in Iran's capital Tehran on April 19, 2015. - Iranian Religious Leader Press Office/Anadolu/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The 2021 election of Ebrahim Raisi as president marked the culmination of Khamenei’s ideological ambitions: a political landscape dominated by conservative and loyal forces with little room for dissent. Raisi was even considered by some as the natural successor to Khamenei and his worldview.</p><p>Under Raisi, Iranian security forces cracked down on demonstrations sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being arrested for allegedly violating the country’s mandatory hijab laws. The protests quickly evolved into a nationwide uprising led largely by women and young people.</p><p>Once again, Khamenei used the full force of the state to stifle calls for change, with hundreds killed and thousands arrested in the crackdown. Raisi’s untimely death in a helicopter crash in 2024 provided Khamenei with another opportunity to address public frustration, and many saw the election of the reform-leaning Masoud Pezeshkian as a step in that direction.</p><p>But Pezeshkian’s reformist agenda — and his hopes of delivering a nuclear deal that could bring economic and social relief to his people — were abruptly derailed by Israel’s attacks.</p><p>When protests erupted six months later, he acknowledged the limits of his government’s ability to address the economic grievances that fueled the demonstrations. For many Iranians, the president had failed to pull the country out of isolation, failed to revive a nuclear deal and failed to deliver the long-promised prosperity.</p><p>In late January, the US began a massive military buildup around Iran while engaging in talks with Tehran via Omani mediation. Those talks never formally collapsed, and all sides were signaling varying degrees of progress just hours ahead of the attacks that ultimately led to Khamenei’s death.</p><p>For Khamenei, it was a final reckoning. He had spent decades warning that engagement with the West was pointless and that Iran’s enemies would eventually strike. Even if the foundations he spent years building were wiped away, for Iran’s hard-liners, he had finally been vindicated.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
