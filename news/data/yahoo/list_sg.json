surely it is the floor for every soldier”.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In response, Senior Minister of State for Defence Zaqy Mohamad said there is a fundamental difference between salaries and NS allowances, and an equivalence should not be drawn between the two.</p><p>A salary is compensation for work done, while NS is a unique civic duty and contribution by all able-bodied Singaporean males and not a transaction, he added.</p><p>“While we acknowledge that serving NS involves opportunity cost, we should not erode our social compact and the ethos of service by casting it as an employer-employee relationship,” he added.</p><p>SMS Zaqy said Mindef regularly reviews allowances and incentives for servicemen, with reviews in 2015, 2020, 2023, and in July 2025.</p><p>The 2023 review saw NS allowance increased by between $125 and $200, depending on rank and vocation. The 2025 review saw allowances raised from between $35 to $75.</p><p>Over the past decade, the allowance for a recruit in basic military training has risen by 65 per cent, said SMS Zaqy. Recruits currently get $790 a month in allowance, while a Lieutenant receives $1,530.</p><p>During national service, the state also takes care of the vast majority of NSFs’ basic needs, such as accommodation and food, and allowances are designed to support their personal upkeep and incidentals, he added.</p><p>Mr Tiong said he disagreed with SMS Zaqy’s framing that accommodation, food, and equipping are part of the compensation package for NSFs.</p><p>“The fact is that people who have no choice get paid less than people who do...Why can’t we find it (in us) to pay our soldiers fairly?” he asked.</p><p>In response, Mr Chan said he had never seen Singaporeans think of NS as a transaction, and that he hoped that generations of Singaporeans will continue to not view NS this way.</p><p>“It is not in our interest to cause invidious comparisons, or to bring down the sacred duty of serving our country into a transaction,” he said.</p><p>“Of course we will take care of our NSmen, of course we will regularly review our NSF allowances (and) do more for NS HOME awards,” added Mr Chan.</p><p>“You can have my assurance we will take care of our NSmen, but I appeal to Members of this House not to conflate duty with transaction.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mindef-cares-for-soldiers-beyond-allowance-ns-is-not-a-transaction-chan-chun-sing?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

rights chief voiced alarm Friday at the deteriorating situation in South Sudan, calling for &quot;urgent action&quot; to avert a return to full-scale civil war.</p><p>&quot;We need urgent action to preserve the peace agreement and prevent fragmentation and cycles of retaliation that could herald a return to all-out civil war,&quot; Volker Turk said in an address to the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p><p>Violence has risen in recent weeks as a power-sharing deal between rival generals, Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, has unravelled.</p><p>At least 280,000 people have been displaced since December in the worst-hit state, Jonglei.</p><p>Turk warned that the situation had deteriorated further in January, as &quot;human rights violations and abuses surged by 45 percent&quot; compared to a month earlier.</p><p>Last month alone, he said his office had documented that 189 civilians had been killed and many more injured.</p><p>The UN rights chief said he was &quot;horrified&quot; to learn of the attack last weekend by government forces and allied militia on a village in Ayod County in Jonglei.</p><p>&quot;Witnesses told my colleagues that troops ordered residents to gather, and then opened fire on the crowd, killing 21 unarmed civilians including women and children,&quot; Turk said.</p><p>He warned that &quot;military discipline appears to have collapsed&quot; on both sides of the conflict, with troops demonstrating &quot;a near-total disregard for civilian protection&quot;.</p><p>His team, he said, had recorded a 40-percent increase compared to 2024 in the number of people killed and injured in the conflict last year, to more than 5,100.</p><p>Turk decried rampant sexual violence, and said his team had documented &quot;a disturbing increase to 550 in the number of civilians abducted by opposition forces and their allies in 2025&quot;.</p><p>He voiced particular concern at hate speech and incitement to violence targeting entire communities and ethnic groups in the country.</p><p>&quot;In one audio recording authenticated by the UN mission, a senior military official urged his forces to spare no lives, and to destroy civilian homes, livestock, and property,&quot; he told the council.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

&quot;those responsible for such crimes may be prosecuted under international law.&quot;</p><p>The rights chief also warned that South Sudan had become &quot;extremely dangerous for humanitarian workers&quot;, with 350 attacks on staff and facilities last year -- more than one third more than in 2024.</p><p>nl/rjm/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

framework that calculates economic output more accurately.</p><p>Gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent in the October-to-December quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to data from the statistics ministry.</p><p>While growth slipped from the 8.4 percent recorded in the previous quarter, it edged past market expectations of 7.6 percent.</p><p>Aditi Nayar of ratings agency ICRA said the GDP growth number was &quot;healthier than what we had expected&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The moderation was expectedly driven by the agriculture and the non-manufacturing industrial sectors,&quot; she said in a note.</p><p>Friday&#39;s reading re-affirmed India as the world&#39;s fastest-growing major economy and is a shot in the arm for policymakers who have struggled with steep US tariffs, a falling rupee and muted consumption for most of 2025.</p><p>Faced with a dimming economic outlook, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to bolster the economy by slashing income and consumption taxes which have helped rebound consumer spending in recent quarters.</p><p>New Delhi also managed to secure a trade deal with Washington in early February, which boosted sentiment around the rupee but came just weeks before the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump&#39;s sweeping tariffs.</p><p>The GDP numbers are the first data released under a revised framework that New Delhi said better captures &quot;the realities of a fast-changing economy&quot;.</p><p>- Data revamp -</p><p>The data overhaul has seen India shift its GDP base year to 2022-23 from 2011-12 and adopt more granular price deflation to help quell concerns that earlier methods relied too heavily on the wholesale price index.</p><p>Growth calculations are now also based on sources of data including India&#39;s online tax and vehicle registration databases.</p><p>The government said the new data aligns official numbers &quot;more closely with the structure and dynamics of today&#39;s economy&quot;.</p><div

year, up from a forecast of 7.4 percent published last month, a press release from the statistics ministry said.</p><p>The latest figures bring Modi closer to his goal of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047 -- a target that most analysts say would require the economy to record about 8 percent growth every year until then.</p><p>Analysts say New Delhi&#39;s growth trajectory reduces the likelihood of any rate cuts from India&#39;s central bank.</p><p>&quot;The important point from a monetary policy perspective is that the new data confirm that the economy is performing

class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Left-wing Greens beat the Britain's ruling Labour party in crunch local polls (Paul ELLIS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Friday to fight &quot;the extremes in politics&quot; after left-wing and hard-right parties both beat his ruling Labour in a crunch vote in a traditional stronghold.</p><p>The embattled centrist leader called the humiliating third-place finish -- behind the victorious leftist Greens and anti-immigration Reform UK party -- in Thursday&#39;s by-election for the Manchester parliamentary seat &quot;disappointing&quot;.</p><p>Coming just weeks after defying calls within his own party to resign after a string of policy U-turns, missteps, and fall-out related choosing an ambassador to the US linked to Jeffrey Epstein, Starmer vowed to &quot;keep on fighting&quot; while acknowledging voters were &quot;frustrated&quot;.</p><p>The&nbsp;result&nbsp;in the constituency of Gorton and Denton that Labour has dominated for decades,&nbsp;shows how the centre-left party is being squeezed by both ends of the political spectrum and the country&#39;s traditional two-party system is fracturing.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons are looking more towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>In his first public comments following the contest, Starmer hit out at Reform and the Greens, branding the hard-right party the &quot;politics of hatred and division&quot; while deriding the Greens&#39; left-wing policy agenda.</p><p>&quot;They are the extremes in politics,&quot; he told broadcasters, adding the two parties can only &quot;identify the grievances&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Threat&#39; -</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber, won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably to become&nbsp;the&nbsp;Greens&#39; fifth&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;MP in the 650-seat British parliament.</p><p>Party leader Zack Polanski, a charismatic figurehead some liken to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani who only took charge of the Greens last September, called it a &quot;seismic&quot; victory.</p><p>&quot;People now recognise there is an alternative,&quot; he told a press conference Friday.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The contest&nbsp;was triggered by ex-lawmaker Andrew Gwynne resigning on health grounds.</p><p>Labour had won the constituency easily in its July 2024 general election in a landslide that swept Starmer to power and ousted the Conservatives after 14 years in office.</p><p>But less than two years later, polls suggest Starmer is the most unpopular British prime minister since surveys began.</p><p>His most recent crisis centred on his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson, an associate of&nbsp;late US&nbsp;sex offender Epstein, as Britain&#39;s ambassador to Washington, before sacking him within six months.</p><p>The next general election is not expected until 2029, but Thursday&#39;s defeat will intensify pressure on Starmer ahead of May local elections, when the party is predicted to also perform poorly.</p><p>University of Manchester politics lecturer Louise Thompson said it showed he must now &quot;fight a war on two fronts&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Whereas previously he&#39;s focused in a much more laser-like way on Reform... Labour will need to take the Green threat much more seriously,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Values&#39; -</p><p>The Greens had never won a parliamentary by-election before, and ran a grassroots campaign that sought to mobilise the constituency&#39;s 28 percent Muslim population.</p><p>The party, which under Polanski has embraced a full-throated left-wing agenda including higher taxes on the wealthy, is avowedly pro-Palestinian.</p><p>In a likely harbinger for upcoming elections, its campaign was less focused on environmental concerns -- the party&#39;s traditional rallying cry -- and more concerned with cost-of-living pressures and other issues.</p><p>The result was a blow for Brexit champion Nigel Farage, whose hard-right Reform party has led national polls for the past year. He called it &quot;a victory for sectarian voting&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Roll on the (local) elections on May 7th,&quot; Farage added. &quot;It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party.&quot;</p><p>Starmer has spent much of his time in office targeting Reform, in particular by toughening Labour&#39;s immigration policies and rhetoric.</p><p>But the stance appears to be alienating elements of Labour&#39;s left-wing base and young people.</p><p>Andrea Egan, the new leftist leader of the traditionally Labour-supporting UNISON union, said the Greens had won &quot;because Labour under Starmer has abandoned progressive values, imitating the far-right instead of taking the fight to them&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If the government wants to survive it urgently needs to stand up for workers and defend the fundamental values of our movement,&quot; she added on X.</p><p>bur-jj/mp/rmb</p></div></article></div>",

Sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex said last year Tether had blocked funds on its platform.</p><p>Authorities around the world have long raised concerns ‌about the role of crypto in illicit ​finance. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) last ​year called on countries to ​take stronger action to combat illicit finance in crypto ‌markets, which are generally less regulated ​than mainstream financial ​markets.</p><p>Money launderers received at least $82 billion in cryptocurrencies last year, up sharply from just $10 billion in 2020, partly driven by growth among ​Chinese-speaking groups, blockchain researchers ‌said in January.</p><p>Stablecoins are mostly used in crypto trading, and their ​volumes have surged in recent years.</p><p>(Reporting by Elizabeth HowcroftEditing by ​Tommy Reggiori Wilkes and Peter Graff)</p></div></article></div>",
