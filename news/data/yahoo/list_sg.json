raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued just before Trump -- who boasts frequently about being a peace president --&nbsp;went into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>Trump&#39;s announcement left much unanswered -- chiefly whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Key US foe Iran on Friday called the directive &quot;regressive and irresponsible&quot;, adding that it was a threat to international security.</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; foreign minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>Japanese atomic bomb survivors group Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan on Friday.</p><p>The directive &quot;directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable,&quot; the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group said in the letter obtained by AFP.</p><p>- Global nuclear testing ban -</p><p>Following Trump&#39;s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>China and the United States observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly,&quot; but did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><p>The president&#39;s statement &quot;speaks for itself,&quot; Vance told reporters at the White House.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an important part of American national security to make sure that this nuclear arsenal we have actually functions properly, and that&#39;s part of a testing regime,&quot; he added.</p><p>It came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social earlier this week.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,459 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations with Russia and China on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992.</p><p>Its two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II make it the only country to have used the weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W.

capture of the western city of El-Fasher,&nbsp;as a UN official warned the &quot;horror is continuing&quot; in both Darfur and neighbouring Kordofan.</p><p>At war with the army since April 2023, the RSF seized El-Fasher on Sunday, dislodging the army&#39;s last stronghold in western Darfur after an 18-month siege marked by bombardment and starvation.</p><p>It has faced widespread accusations of grave abuses after taking the city, with survivors who reached the nearby town of Tawila telling AFP of mass killings, children shot in front of their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled.</p><p>In a statement late Thursday,&nbsp;the RSF said it had detained several fighters accused of &quot;violations that occurred during the liberation&quot; of El-Fasher, including one known as Abu Lulu who appeared in multiple videos on his TikTok committing summary executions.</p><p>In one clip verified by AFP, he is seen shooting unarmed men at close range. Another shows him standing among armed men celebrating near dozens of bodies and burnt vehicles.</p><p>The RSF released a video appearing to show Abu Lulu behind bars in what they claimed to be a North Darfur prison.</p><p>The RSF also affirmed its adherence to &quot;the law, rules of conduct and military discipline during wartime&quot;, saying that it had begun investigations to bring the fighters to justice.</p><p>&quot;Abu Lulu is arrested and will be brought to a fair trial according to the law,&quot; one RSF member says in the video.</p><p>Since Sunday, videos circulating online have purportedly shown men in RSF uniforms carrying out summary executions around the city, which has been cut off from all communications since its fall.</p><p>Emtithal Mahmoud, a US-based Sudanese poet from El-Fasher, told AFP she recognised her cousin, Nadifa, in a video shared by RSF accounts, lying dead on the ground.</p><p>- &#39;Horror is continuing&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair said she was sceptical that the purported arrests would bring an end to the violence.</p><p>&quot;We expect these atrocities to continue, particularly against non-Arab groups,&quot; she told AFP, citing communities such as the Zaghawa, Fur, Berti and Masalit in Darfur.</p><p>In 2023, the RSF -- descended from the Janjaweed Arab militias accused of mass atrocities in Darfur two decades ago -- was blamed for massacres against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur capital El-Geneina, killing up to 15,000 people.</p><p>&quot;Overall, these patterns reflect a disturbing repetition of ethnic tensions from 20 years ago, now compounded by disputes over resource control and political power in the country,&quot; Khair said.</p><p>More than 36,000 people have fled El-Fasher since Sunday, according to the UN&#39;s migration agency, while the fate of about 177,000 civilians still trapped in the city remains unknown.</p><p>The UN said Thursday that around 1,750 people had also fled the North Darfur town of Tina -- to the west of El-Fasher -- across the border into neighbouring Chad.</p><p>UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the Security Council on Thursday there were &quot;credible reports of widespread executions&quot; after the RSF entered El-Fasher.</p><p>&quot;We cannot hear the screams, but... the horror is continuing,&quot; he said, describing rapes, mutilations and killings with impunity.</p><p>Fletcher said the RSF claimed to be investigating, but questioned its commitment amid the &quot;appalling news&quot; from North Darfur.</p><p>RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo had earlier vowed accountability for &quot;anyone who has made a mistake&quot;.</p><p>Satellite imagery analysed by Yale&#39;s Humanitarian Research Lab showed clusters in the city &quot;consistent with adult human bodies&quot;, and discolouration that may indicate &quot;pools of blood&quot;, its director told AFP.</p><p>- Bloodshed in Kordofan -</p><p>Fletcher warned that bloodshed in Sudan was spreading beyond Darfur, with atrocities reported in the neighbouring Kordofan region.</p><p>According to UN figures, between Sunday and Wednesday more than 35,000 people fled five localities in North Kordofan state, including Bara, which lies north of state capital El-Obeid on a key route to Darfur and was overrun by paramilitaries on Saturday.</p><p>Martha Pobee, the assistant UN secretary-general for Africa, highlighted &quot;reports of large-scale atrocities perpetrated&quot; by the RSF in Bara, including, &quot;reprisals against so-called &#39;collaborators&#39;, which are often ethnically motivated&quot;.</p><p>At least 50 civilians were killed there in recent days, both in fighting and executions, including five Red Crescent volunteers, according to the UN.</p><p>Kordofan is &quot;clearly going to be the next area of military escalation&quot;, analyst Khair said.</p><p>On Thursday, the RSF accused the army of launching a drone attack on a school in eastern North Kordofan, claiming dozens of students and teachers were killed or injured -- an allegation the army denied.</p><p>AFP could not independently verify the attack.</p><p>Both the army and the RSF have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict.</p><p>The US has previously determined the RSF committed genocide in Darfur.</p><p>El-Fasher&#39;s fall to the RSF gave it full control over all five state capitals in Darfur, effectively splitting Sudan along an east-west axis. The paramilitaries have also established a self-declared rival government in Darfur.</p><p>The army holds Sudan&#39;s north, east and centre.</p><p>bur-maf/smw</p></div></article></div>",

And then there are bigger issues, which can lead to friends ending their relationships,” said Saba Harouni Lurie, licensed marriage and family therapist, founder of <a href=\"https://www.losangelesmftherapist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Take Root Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Take Root Therapy</a>. “In my experience, people are often conflict-avoidant, and it’s not uncommon for folks to withdraw from friendships without ever addressing the issues at hand. They may elect to take space until things blow over, or they may avoid one another altogether.”</p><p><span>In reality, fighting with friends —&nbsp;much like fighting with a partner —&nbsp;isn’t something to shy away from; in fact, not only does it often signal a close friendship to begin with, but it can also deepen the friendship in turn by bringing in new vulnerability. </span></p><p><strong>Relationship: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/friend-complain-partner-what-to-say_l_680082e1e4b019ebe499fafb?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:What To Say When Your Friend Won&#39;t Stop Complaining About Their Partner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">What To Say When Your Friend Won&#39;t Stop Complaining About Their Partner</a></strong></p><p><span>“Fighting can be seen as a sign of closeness, but it’s also what allows for closeness, because the repair that happens after a fight helps us feel more connected and more safe in the relationship,” said Harouni Lurie. “When friends are willing to work through their issues rather than let them fester or try to sweep them under the rug, it shows that the relationship matters enough to risk discomfort to take care of it.”</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>If you and a friend find yourself in an argument, there is no other way to work through it: You have to communicate.</p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>When friends are willing to work through their issues rather than let them fester or try to sweep them under the rug, it shows that the relationship matters enough to risk discomfort to take care of it.<span class=\"attribution\">Saba Harouni Lurie, licensed marriage and family therapist, founder of Take Root Therapy.</span></p></blockquote></div><p><span>“I would encourage folks to approach conflict with curiosity instead of defensiveness and to try to understand their friend’s perspective, even if they don’t agree with it,” said Harouni Lurie. “It’s also important to be willing to take accountability for your part in the conflict and to be clear about what you need going forward.”</span></p><p>Then the two of you can come up with a solution that works for everyone.

Unfortunately, in friendship, many people don’t feel equipped to address miscommunications.</p><p><span>“In cases like this, one friend might feel hurt or insulted by something the other said, and instead of asking for clarification, they may pull back,” Harouni Lurie said. “The other friend might not even realize anything is wrong, or they sense tension but don’t know what caused it.”</span></p><p><span>If a friendship means a lot to you, it’s important to assume the other person had the best intentions. “When looking at our own behavior, we give ourselves the benefit of the doubt (we were tired, or busy, or meant well),” said Anderson. “But when a friend’s text feels off or their tone rubs us the wrong way, we often don’t offer them that same grace. Instead, we assume they’re mad or don’t care, and we pull away.”</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pregnancy-advance-directives-goog_l_68ff71c1e4b0049ce5fdcd59?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:These States Will Ignore Your Final Wishes Just Because You’re Pregnant;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">These States Will Ignore Your Final Wishes Just Because You’re Pregnant</a></strong></p><p><em><strong>The solution:</strong></em>Obviously, not all misunderstandings are created equal, and you may be able to move on from a small one easily. But if you were really hurt by a miscommunication or if they keep happening in a specific friendship, you can smooth things over by asking the simple question, “What did you mean by that?” said Anderson.</p><p><span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passive-aggressive-phrases-stop-using_l_65f07f8ee4b02ad7de1a7355\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Passive-aggression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Passive-aggression</a> is likely to do more harm than good, said Harouni Lurie, adding that you should try naming how you understood your friend’s comments or actions before asking if that’s what they meant. “The friend who made the original comment can clarify their intention and apologize if necessary,” the expert said. “The key here is creating space for both people to feel heard.”</span></p><h2><strong>One-Sided Friendships</strong></h2><p><em><span><strong>The fight:</strong></span></em><span>Friendships naturally go through seasons when one person in the dynamic isn’t able to give as much as the other, but if this isn’t a </span><em><span>season</span></em><span> in the dynamic but the </span><em><span>dynamic itself</span></em><span>, this can naturally lead to fights. “Getting stuck in one-sided needs being met … can lead to overfunctioning, burnout and resentment on the part of you, the ‘giving’ friend,” said </span><a href=\"https://www.laynebaker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Layne Baker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Layne Baker</span></a><span>, licensed marriage and family therapist, a psychotherapist in Los Angeles, California.</span></p><p><strong><em>The solution: </em></strong><span>If your friendship wasn’t always one-sided but has become so, perhaps because your friend was going through a difficult transition and your friendship got stuck in that dynamic: “Bring your feelings to your friend, starting with a heap of empathy for their experience and understanding that they needed you in a bigger way,” Baker said. “Then share your desire to re-establish more equity between you so both sides of the friendship benefit from taking up space and getting support, sharing life updates, and celebrating wins. Be honest about why this matters to you, and give your friend room to respond.” </span></p><p><strong>Relationship: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/frenemy-when-to-cut-ties_l_68b5f898e4b081a4d93b8821?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:5 Undeniable Signs You Need To Cut Ties With Your &#39;Frenemy&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">5 Undeniable Signs You Need To Cut Ties With Your &#39;Frenemy&#39;</a></strong></p><p><span>The expert stressed the importance of listening to your friend here, rather than focusing solely on your side of the story.</span></p><h2><strong>Different Expectations For Friendship</strong></h2><p><strong><em>The fight: </em></strong>Similarly to a one-sided friendship, two friends with different expectations for friendship can breed difficult feelings. Whereas in a one-sided friendship, your friend might specifically ask for a lot of support while not providing any in return, having different expectations might mean that you naturally offer a ton of support, unaware that your friend doesn’t expect that from you, and therefore doesn’t return it.</p><p>But different expectations can take many forms, such as “frequency of contact or time together” and “following through when they make plans,” Harouni Lurie said.</p><p>Baker also cited the example of bringing your partner along to plans with your friend, assuming they won’t mind, when they were actually looking forward to catching up with you one-on-one. Harouni Lurie added that mismatches in expectations can be exacerbated at different stages of life, such as when one friend becomes a parent or starts a new job.</p><p><strong>Relationship: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/therapy-speak-texting-dating_l_68b8547ae4b042094acfcccc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:This Controversial Communication Trend Might Be Silently Killing Your Relationship;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">This Controversial Communication Trend Might Be Silently Killing Your Relationship</a></strong></p><p><strong><em>The solution: </em></strong><span>While so many of us might naturally resort to letting resentment fester rather than addressing the issue, it’s best to tackle it head-on if you’re able. </span></p><p><span>“In these instances, it can be so helpful to make expectations explicit,” said Harouni Lurie. “That means having a conversation about what you each need from the friendship and what you’re realistically able to give right now. Being specific and forthcoming helps both people understand what the other needs and whether they can meet those needs.” The expert also recommended revisiting this conversation as life circumstances change.</span></p><h2><strong>Big Life Changes</strong></h2><p><em><strong>The fight:</strong></em>We evolve over time, and inevitably so do our friendships — particularly when one friend moves away, has a child, or starts a new, demanding job. “That kind of shift can make the other person feel left behind, even if no one meant to hurt anyone,” said Anderson. “It’s easy to start assuming they don’t care or you’re no longer a priority. But often, it’s not about connection fading. It’s about capacity and changing rhythms.”</p><p><em><span><strong>The solution:</strong></span></em><span>Like with most (all?) conflicts in friendship, “The only way through that is to name it,” Anderson said. “You can say, ‘I know things feel different right now and I want to talk about what staying connected could look like.’ Most friendships can stretch, but not if you pretend nothing’s changed.”</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Experts encourage us to see conflict as an opportunity for curiosity and connection.

At events where the partner will be present, focus on changing your attitude towards them; it doesn’t mean you suddenly have to be best friends — just accept their presence and try to find neutral ground with them.</p><p><span>“You don’t have to ‘like’ or ‘be friends’ with a friend’s partner, and that’s OK,” Baker added.</span></p><h2><strong>Misaligned Values</strong></h2><p><em><strong>The fight:</strong></em>Having different, incompatible values is common, especially in friendships forged in childhood or young adulthood, since our values constantly evolve throughout our lives.</p><p><span> “Values are made up of the things that matter to you and what you care to protect the most; they can be informed by your boundaries, your ways of being and behaving, your spiritual beliefs, and political views,” said Baker. “These are all things that may shift over the timeline of a friendship.”</span></p><p><strong><em>The solution: </em></strong><span>Differing values aren’t a death sentence for your friendship, unless this dynamic “causes harm or undermines that all-important psychological safety,” said Baker. </span></p><p><span>If that isn’t the case for you, “focus on what values you do continue to share, as they can help sustain a sturdy baseline for your friendship,” Baker suggested. “And, engage in curious dialogue about your emerging differences. Be open to the person your friend is becoming as you embrace your personal evolution as well.”</span></p><h2><strong>Building Resentment</strong></h2><p><em><strong>The fight:</strong></em>All of the fights above and more, if left unresolved, can eventually turn into resentment —&nbsp;even if each individual issue feels small at the time. “Confrontation is uncomfortable, and we will absorb that discomfort by sweeping things under the rug rather than risk a conflict with a friend,” Baker said.</p><p><strong><em>The solution: </em></strong><span>Unfortunately for the conflict-averse among us (and isn’t that most of us?), there’s really no way around this: You have to talk things out with your friend. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not suggesting you bring up every teensy thing that irks you about your friend every time, but if there are some recurring themes in your friendship that don’t feel right, naming those things is crucial if you want to achieve resolution,” said Baker. “The point of talking things out isn’t to simply unburden your icks and resentments, but rather to invite your friend to join with you in figuring out what needs to change.”</span></p><p><span> You never know; a conversation like this may just save your friendship.</span></p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/common-friendship-mistakes_l_68fbce9ce4b011e808864d90?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Most Common Friendship &#39;Mistakes&#39; That Are Making You A Worse Hang;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">The Most Common Friendship &#39;Mistakes&#39; That Are Making You A Worse Hang</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/read-receipts-friendship-left-on-read_l_68752557e4b025efd81cd179?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:This 1 iPhone Setting Might Be Messing With Your Friendships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">This 1 iPhone Setting Might Be Messing With Your Friendships</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/partner-best-friend-study_l_6824addce4b021b5064a8d1f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Is Your Partner Your &#39;Best Friend&#39;?

Her finger darts across the tablet, as an in-game avatar tells Ms Toh Siew Mui, 49, to choose four fruits from a table of pictures of various objects.</p><p>Another game instructs her to listen carefully and select objects that match audio descriptions. With furrowed brows and deep in concentration, she aced the game and breaks out in a smile.</p><p>Ms Toh is among residents at Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled who are testing games on a new app developed with Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), aimed at slowing cognitive decline and providing socio-emotional support to seniors with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>The app is called Advancing Mental Invigoration (AMI) Intelli, which also features an artificial intelligence-powered conversational chatbot.</p><p>To better support its ageing residents, Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled is working with SUTD to develop and pilot the app, which is still in development. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the university and the home on Oct 31 at Bishan Home.</p><p>Mr Lau Wah Ming, honorary chairman of Bishan Home, said the app is the first of its kind in Singapore that is created specifically for adults with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>The app is expected to be used by residents at the home in about a year’s time.</p><p>“As our residents age, we must go beyond their physical needs or their basic needs. Our mission now is to further enhance their quality of life, to keep their minds active, their daily lives and hearts engaged, and their spirit connected to the world around them,” he said at the 27th anniversary of the home, which currently houses nearly 126 residents.</p><p>The organisation aims to provide tablets to all residents who are suited to use the app. Funding for the devices will come from various grants and the home’s internal budget.</p><p>If successfully implemented, Bishan Home hopes to work with government agencies to see how the app could benefit the wider community of seniors and adults with intellectual disabilities.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Speaking to The Straits Times, Mr Lau said one of the key issues that the home faces is the growing medical conditions and cognitive decline brought about as residents age. Most of its residents are in their 50s.</p><p>The app the home is experimenting with is built on a bilingual dementia-prevention game for seniors launched by SUTD in 2023.</p><p>The games can be personalised to meet the different needs and ability levels of adults with intellectual disabilities, Professor of Psychology at SUTD Yow Wei Quin said. For instance, the games can be played in six languages: English, Malay, Tamil, Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien.</p><p>“The interface is kept simple and does not include too many colours which might make it confusing for them,” Prof Yow said.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"(From left to right) Professor of Psychology at SUTD Yow Wei Quin, Associate Professor of Anthropology at SUTD Lyle Fearnley, honorary chairman of Bishan Home Lau Wah Ming and vice-chairman Angeline Chua at a MOU signing on Oct 31.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XjrfHnyRTElKL3xPzSJVmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/2946a7f48efc89f1b31d5c88e646fa6c><noscript><img alt=\"(From left to right) Professor of Psychology at SUTD Yow Wei Quin, Associate Professor of Anthropology at SUTD Lyle Fearnley, honorary chairman of Bishan Home Lau Wah Ming and vice-chairman Angeline Chua at a MOU signing on Oct 31.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XjrfHnyRTElKL3xPzSJVmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/2946a7f48efc89f1b31d5c88e646fa6c class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>(From left to right) Professor of Psychology at SUTD Yow Wei Quin, Associate Professor of Anthropology at SUTD Lyle Fearnley, honorary chairman of Bishan Home Lau Wah Ming and vice-chairman Angeline Chua at a MOU signing on Oct 31.</figcaption></div></figure><p>She added that the games aim to “stimulate abilities such as receptive and expressive verbal skills through familiar activities like colour matching and object dragging, with a bilingualism module for higher-functioning residents”.</p><p>Speaking to ST, Ms Toh said in Mandarin that she enjoyed playing the game and felt that the avatar - a girl figure with brown bob haircut and big brown eyes - is “cute”.</p><p>“I hope that the app will be able to teach me new things,” she said, adding that she would like to see a game with musical elements, as music helps to soothe her mood.</p><p>Another feature in the app is an AI-powered chatbot, designed to offer socio-emotional support to users, by checking in on their wellbeing. The chatbot can converse in English and Mandarin, with the researchers looking to add more languages.</p><p>The users’ conversations with the chatbot and their behaviours in the game can be also analysed, to help caregivers gauge their cognitive and socio-emotional state.</p><p>“At Bishan Home, we believe that innovation must always have a heart. Our partnership with SUTD shows how AI can be harnessed for a good purpose: to uplift lives, spark inclusion and give dignity to every person we serve,” Mr Lau said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/how-bishan-home-for-the-intellectually-disabled-hopes-to-slow-cognitive-decline-in-residents?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.</p><p>The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/10/28/africa/sudan-rsf-takes-el-fasher-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\"

has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”</p><p>Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.</p><p>Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s <a

Fasher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">withdrawal from El Fasher</a> earlier this week.</p><p>Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.</p><p>RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”</p><p>In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.</p><p>The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.</p><p>On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.</p><p>The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.</p><p>Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/us-determines-sudans-rsf-paramilitary-group-committed-genocide-in-countrys-civil-war?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:accused the RSF of committing genocide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">accused the RSF of committing genocide</a> against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”</p><p>Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.</p><p>Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.</p><p>Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.</p><p>One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.</p><p>The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.</p><p>Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.</p><p>Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.</p><p>Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”</p><p>Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gu2xDaWK59IQNRhYExD5yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ee63403559dab2dd172c7160c11f220b><noscript><img alt=\"Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gu2xDaWK59IQNRhYExD5yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ee63403559dab2dd172c7160c11f220b class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.</p><p>Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.</p><p>The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.</p><p>The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.</p><p>“The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.</p><p>“So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.</p><p>Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.</p><p>Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”</p><p>“(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.</p><p>Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.</p><p>“On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.</p><p>In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.</p><p>Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.</p><p>“All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.</p><p>“It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.</p><p>The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/04/20/africa/wagner-sudan-russia-libya-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Russian paramilitary group Wagner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Russian paramilitary group Wagner</a>.</p><p>The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”</p><h3>Fears for the missing men</h3><p>The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”</p><p>Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”</p><p>“Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.</p><p>Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.</p><p>“The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.</p><p>Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.</p><p>“The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QnQH52JVAtZqWIsBXpRaTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c0b70829779c04cadab65ff09282a0bc><noscript><img alt=\"Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QnQH52JVAtZqWIsBXpRaTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c0b70829779c04cadab65ff09282a0bc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.</p><p>He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.</p><p>Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.</p><p>“(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.</p><p>The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.</p><p>As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.</p><p>Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”</p><p>“We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.</p><p>CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Avery Schmitz and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Trick-or-treaters made their rounds at the White House on Thursday as President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump hosted their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/video/kid-halloween-costumes-white-house-trump-vrtc?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:annual Halloween event;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">annual Halloween event</a>. For once, there was consensus in Washington … on making sure no candy bucket went empty.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.</strong></p><h3>1️⃣ Government shutdown</h3><p>As the government shutdown reaches day 31, Congress is edging closer to the 35-day record for the longest shutdown in US history. Officials have warned that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/boston-judge-intervene-snap-payments?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:food stamp benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">food stamp benefits</a> are slated to end for millions of Americans this weekend due to the impasse. Many federal workers who are going unpaid have also told CNN they are struggling to cover basic living expenses. On Thursday, President Trump urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end the shutdown by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:eliminating the Senate filibuster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">eliminating the Senate filibuster</a> — the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation. But many Republicans are opposed to the idea, arguing that it would serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.</p><h3>2️⃣ Holiday travel</h3><p>With just weeks until what could be the busiest Thanksgiving air travel period ever, airlines are calling on Congress to reopen the government so air traffic controllers and TSA agents can receive their paychecks. Many FAA employees missed their pay this month, resulting in staffing shortages as more workers call out sick. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Thursday that Americans <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:could face a travel “disaster” and “massive delays”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">could face a travel “disaster” and “massive delays”</a> if the shutdown extends into the holiday season. Their remarks came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, where participants discussed temporary solutions — including the recruitment of more air traffic controllers.</p><h3>3️⃣ Hurricane Melissa aftermath</h3><p>Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after Hurricane Melissa unleashed widespread destruction in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 49 people have died, Reuters reported, though officials have said that number could climb in the coming weeks. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jamaica took the heaviest battering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Jamaica took the heaviest battering</a>: Melissa made landfall there as a Category 5 storm, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:coastal town of Black River;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">coastal town of Black River</a> on Thursday. Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>4️⃣ Royal family</h3><p>Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of starting the process to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles</a> and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor. The move comes as the family attempts to distance itself from Andrew’s ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/video/src-virginia-giuffres-family-reacts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Virginia Giuffre;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Virginia Giuffre</a>, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager. Giuffre — who the prince claims never to have met — died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.</p><h3>5️⃣ Listeria outbreak</h3><p>Two additional deaths have been reported in a listeria outbreak linked to recalled ready-to-eat pasta salads and prepared meals sold at major grocery chains, including Trader Joe’s, Sprouts Farmers Market, Kroger, and Walmart, health officials said Thursday. The recalled items have led to 25 hospitalizations, six deaths and one fetal loss. The FDA, CDC and other health agencies are investigating the multi-state outbreak, which has been connected to Listeria monocytogenes contamination in precooked pasta supplied by Nate’s Fine Foods Inc. Consumers should <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/listeria-outbreak-prepared-meals?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:check their refrigerators and freezers for these products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">check their refrigerators and freezers for these products</a> and avoid eating them, the FDA said. Nate’s Fine Foods issued an apology and said it is “fully committed to transparency and to taking every necessary step to protect the health and trust of our consumers.”</p><h3>Breakfast browse</h3><h3>Hundreds celebrate Day of the Dead in Mexico City</h3><p>Día de los Muertos celebrations <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/travel/video/day-of-the-dead-celebrated-in-mexico-city-ldndigvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:have begun in Mexico City;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">have begun in Mexico City</a>, with hundreds taking to the streets dressed as La Catrina, the iconic Mexican skeleton figure.</p><h3>The ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ hat is inspired by centuries-old fashion</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/style/video/korean-gat-fashion-kpop-demon-hunters-digvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:A traditional Korean hat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">A traditional Korean hat</a> featured in Netflix’s hit movie “KPop Demon Hunters” has become a must-have for fans.</p><h3>This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy</h3><p>Chipotle reported miserable earnings this week and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter.

She was diagnosed with cancer the same month, and underwent a double mastectomy in August 2022, right about the time she turned 24.</p><p>Now 27 and cancer-free, Ms Ng has switched jobs and is a financial advisor. In her spare time, she helps out at the Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF) as a befriender to support others battling the disease.</p><p>She said: “Breast cancer can happen to anyone at any time. It don’t discriminate based on age or wait until you are financially sound.”</p><p>For her, the one niggle was in not knowing to conduct her own breast self-examinations earlier.</p><p>A new poll has found that 9 in 10 young women today are not taking active steps for their breast health. However, almost half of them associated self-exams and monitoring changes with breast health.</p><p>This is among the key findings published in a BCF report called A Study In Pink: Young Women And Breast Cancer.</p><p>The report is based on a survey of 800 women in Singapore aged between 18 and 40 and aims to better understand perceptions towards breast cancer among young women, a demographic often overlooked in breast health discussions.</p><p>BCF, a social service agency, was established in 1997 to provide support for the breast cancer community and raises awareness on the importance of early detection of the disease.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The survey, carried out as part of efforts to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, was done in partnership with The Estee Lauder Companies and Gilead Sciences.</p><p>In a joint statement on Oct 8, the three organisations highlighted three other key findings from the survey.</p><p>One, there is a gap between awareness of breast cancer and knowledge about the disease among the public. Two, cost of treatment can be a barrier to safeguarding breast health. Three, there is a willingness to talk and learn more about the disease.</p><p>The survey found that, although 70 per cent of young women knew that breast cancer can be detected early, only 22 per cent knew what to look out for.</p><p>Nearly 40 per cent admitted to lacking knowledge in the topic, and only 14 per cent knew how to perform a self-exam.</p><p>Cost of treatment was the top fear for 56 per cent of respondents, compared with 29 per cent for mastectomy, and 27 per cent for mortality. Only a third believed they had enough financial coverage for preventive care.</p><p>Affordable screening was the most popular initiative - 54 per cent of respondents asked for it.</p><p>Ninety-four per cent of respondents said they wish people are more comfortable discussing breast health, and over a third already feel ready to do so.</p><p>Forty-five per cent of respondents, however, cited uncertainty as a barrier to begin taking steps for their breast health, and want clearer guidance on what to do.</p><p>BCF general manager Jacob Soo said: “The findings remind us that awareness alone is not enough; true progress begins with health literacy, early action, and accessible support.</p><p>“Awareness is high; the know-how and confidence to act are not.&nbsp;Busy lives, a fear of ‘finding something’, and uncertainty about what’s right at their age all get in the way,” he added.</p><p>In line with these findings, BCF said it is stepping up efforts to support and engage younger women. One example is the Young Women’s Networking Initiative – a peer-support platform that connects young survivors and at-risk women in their 20s and 30s.</p><p>BCF will also introduce more tailored education programmes, and expand outreach initiatives in schools and workplaces.</p><p>On Oct 11, BCF hosted its annual flagship event, the Pink Ribbon Walk 2025 at OCBC Square in Kallang. “We want this generation, and the next, to feel informed, confident, and supported to act early for themselves, and for the women who will follow,” said Mr Soo.

It&#39;s in the best interest of United States. It&#39;s in the best interest of China,&quot; Huang said.</p><p>&quot;So I&#39;m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia&#39;s technology could be exported to China.&quot;</p><p>US-CHINA FRICTION</p><p>The extent of China&#39;s access to Nvidia&#39;s chips has been a key point of friction with the United States as the two wrestle for dominance in high-end computing power and <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:artificial intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>Washington has put export controls on sales of Nvidia&#39;s most advanced AI chips to China, seeking to limit its tech progress, particularly in applications that could help its military.</p><p>Huang has tried to persuade the Trump administration to loosen the controls, saying Chinese AI&#39;s dependence on U.S. hardware was good for America.</p><p>Nvidia has been working on a new chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be less capable than the model sold outside the country but more powerful than the most advanced model it is currently allowed to sell there, the H20, sources have previously said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But while private Chinese companies are believed to be very interested in purchasing such a chip, the Chinese government has turned cool towards Nvidia, discouraging purchases of the H20, and is instead promoting domestic chip manufacturers such as Huawei.</p><p>Huang told reporters that Nvidia had been hoping for &quot;non-zero market share&quot; in China, but was now expecting zero.</p><p>U.S. national security concerns that the Chinese military could use U.S. technology did not make sense, he added, because China&#39;s own domestically produced AI chips were good enough for their military applications.</p><p>He also said it would be &quot;foolish&quot; to underestimate the incredible competitive spirit of Huawei, which last month unveiled its plans to compete against Nvidia in AI chips.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can&#39;t build systems,&quot; he said. &quot;It is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible competitive spirit of Huawei.
