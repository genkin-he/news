painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.</p><p>Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.</p><p>Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NoBK6mnQNeZUwiaWZT67sg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/82595c23374d893813b492b3a54d08fc><noscript><img alt=\"Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NoBK6mnQNeZUwiaWZT67sg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/82595c23374d893813b492b3a54d08fc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.</p><p>“What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.</p><p>The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.</p><p>Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jl0708\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:July 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">July 2017</a> for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.</p><p>Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The colors of the US flag lit up the Palace of the Republic in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, on November 6, 2024, to mark US President Donald Trump&#39;s reelection. - Radivoje Pavicic/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SfEP5sG4dCOLNwqDfs7Z9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5bed66c0845493690dde79dabb1a95d3><noscript><img alt=\"The colors of the US flag lit up the Palace of the Republic in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, on November 6, 2024, to mark US President Donald Trump&#39;s reelection. - Radivoje Pavicic/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SfEP5sG4dCOLNwqDfs7Z9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5bed66c0845493690dde79dabb1a95d3 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The colors of the US flag lit up the Palace of the Republic in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, on November 6, 2024, to mark US President Donald Trump's reelection. - Radivoje Pavicic/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president.

In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.</p><p>This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause.

The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.</p><p>Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment.</p><h3>Injuries were devastating</h3><p>The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.</p><p>Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.</p><p>“She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”</p><p>The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.</p><p>A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.</p><p>Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.</p><p>In another emotional courtroom moment in December 2023, Zwerner read a statement during the sentencing of the student’s mother on charges related to the shooting.</p><p>“The boy pointed the gun directly at me and shot. The single bullet went through my left hand and lodged into my upper left chest, leaving traces of bullet fragments in both areas that will remain forever,” Zwerner said at the time.</p><p>“When this happened and emergency responders worked to keep me alive, I was not sure whether it would be my final moment on earth.”</p><h3>School official is only defendant</h3><p>Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit filed months after the shooting. A judge previously dismissed the other original defendants, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>The student’s mother was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/virgina-teacher-mother-shooting-sentenced?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentenced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentenced</a> to a total of nearly four years in prison for  child neglect and federal weapons charges.</p><p>The boy was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-no-charges?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not charged</a> with any wrongdoing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758><noscript><img alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/22/us/newport-news-virginia-teacher-shooting-gun-closet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously told CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previously told CNN</a>.</p><p>However, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/virginia-teacher-shooting-mother-guilty?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:later said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">later said</a> authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>From a crippling trade conflict to the Ukraine war, here&#39;s what Beijing and Washington say was achieved during Donald Trump and Xi Jinping&#39;s first face-to-face talks in six years:</p><p>- Fentanyl, tariffs -</p><p>The fentanyl trade has long been a sore point: Washington accuses Beijing of turning a blind eye to exports of chemicals used to make the drug, a charge China denies.</p><p>Trump hit China with a 20-percent levy early this year over fentanyl, but said it would be reduced to 10 percent after Xi agreed at their Busan summit to &quot;work very hard to stop the flow&quot; of the powerful opioid, which has killed thousands of Americans.</p><p>The reduction would bring average US tariffs on China to 47 percent.</p><p>Washington would also suspend for a year steeper &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariffs that targeted China, Beijing&#39;s commerce ministry said, ahead of a trade truce set to expire next month. China will make corresponding adjustments.</p><p>- Hill of beans -</p><p>Beijing has retaliated against the US tariffs with levies on American agricultural products, including soybeans, hurting a key source of Trump&#39;s political support: farmers.</p><p>More than half of US soybean exports went to China last year, but Beijing halted all orders as the trade dispute deepened.</p><p>Trump said China had now agreed to purchase &quot;tremendous&quot; amounts of soybeans and other farm products.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of the crop &quot;during this season&quot;.</p><p>- Rare earths, ships -</p><p>A strategic field dominated by China that is essential for manufacturing in defence, automobiles and consumer electronics, rare earths were expected to occupy a central role in the Busan talks.</p><p>Beijing imposed sweeping export controls on the materials and related technology this month.</p><p>Trump swiftly announced retaliatory tariffs of 100 percent on all Chinese goods, which he threatened would start this weekend.</p><p>But the US leader insisted Thursday that &quot;that whole situation, that roadblock is gone now&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>China&#39;s commerce ministry confirmed the rare earths restrictions had been suspended &quot;for one year&quot;.</p><p>Washington in turn agreed to suspend for one year a move imposing &quot;Entity List&quot; export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies in which they had at least a 50 percent stake, a Chinese spokesperson said.</p><p>The United States also agreed to halt for a year measures targeting China&#39;s shipbuilding industry that led to both sides applying port fees against each other&#39;s ships, they said.</p><p>China would suspend its &quot;countermeasures&quot; after the US action, they added, for one year too.</p><p>- Ukraine -</p><p>Trump said the United States and China agreed to cooperate more on seeking an end to war in Ukraine.</p><p>China says it is a neutral party, but Kyiv and Western governments have long accused Beijing of providing political and economic support to Moscow.</p><p>Trump told reporters the subject came up &quot;very strongly&quot; during his talks with Xi.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s going to help us, and we&#39;re going to work together on Ukraine,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>- Chips -</p><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>US chip giant Nvidia has been caught in the geopolitical tussle. Nvidia&#39;s chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in AI development.</p><p>&quot;We did discuss chips,&quot; Trump said, adding that Huang would speak to Beijing about the dispute. &quot;We&#39;re sort of the arbitrator or the referee.&quot;</p><p>- TikTok -</p><p>The talks failed to result in a final deal for TikTok&#39;s US operations to be transferred to American ownership, despite Bessent saying beforehand that Xi and Trump may &quot;consummate&quot; an agreement in Busan.</p><p>Washington has sought to wrest the popular social media app&#39;s US operations from the hands of Chinese parent company ByteDance, citing national security concerns.</p><p>aue-oho-mya-bys/des</p></div></article></div>",

2023 (NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump Thursday sowed confusion among experts with his call for the start of nuclear weapons testing, with some pundits interpreting the announcement as US preparations for a shock resumption of explosive testing after more than 30 years.</p><p>The US president baffled foreign government and nuclear weapons experts alike when he said he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing &quot;on an equal basis&quot; to China and Russia.</p><p>Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the US president also said that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests and it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again because others are testing.</p><p>The last time Russia officially tested a nuclear weapon was in 1990, and the United States last tested a nuclear bomb in 1992.</p><p>North Korea is the only country to have conducted nuclear weapons tests this century.</p><p>Heloise Fayet, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations, said it was not immediately clear what Trump meant -- &nbsp;or whether the United States might be preparing to tear up the global rulebook and resume nuclear weapons testing after a 33-year hiatus.</p><p>&quot;Either he is talking about testing missiles, but the United States already does that,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Or he is talking about subcritical tests, but I don&#39;t think he has mastered that level of technology,&quot; she added, referring to low-yield tests authorised by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p><p>&quot;Or he is talking about real tests, but no one does that except North Korea.&quot;</p><p>Trump&#39;s announcement came after President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had in recent days tested nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons -- the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone.</p><p>On Thursday, the Kremlin sought to cool tensions, saying those tests did not constitute a test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>- &#39;Extremely complicated&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>William Alberque, a former head of NATO&#39;s nuclear non-proliferation centre, pointed to Trump&#39;s lack of clarity.</p><p>&quot;Initially, I thought Trump was reacting to Russia&#39;s announcements about new systems like the nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik and the Poseidon torpedo. So my first interpretation was that Trump was referring to system testing, not warhead testing,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>But like all nuclear powers, the United States already tests its weapons.</p><p>In September, the United States carried out tests of its nuclear-capable Trident missiles.</p><p>There is also a possibility that Trump might have meant the so-called subcritical nuclear tests, said Fayet.</p><p>&quot;We are almost certain that Russia and China are conducting subcritical tests that release a certain amount of energy but remain within the limits,&quot; said Fayet.</p><p>But &quot;in the United States, they are conducting more restrictive subcritical tests, with no energy release, no heat and no critical reaction&quot;.</p><p>Trump could demand to catch up, she said.</p><p>&quot;But it&#39;s an extremely complicated subject, and I don&#39;t know if he is at that level of subtlety,&quot; she added.</p><p>- &#39;Chain reaction&#39; -</p><p>Alberque said that after closely examining Trump&#39;s statements, he was inclined to think that &quot;he&#39;s talking about warhead testing.&quot;</p><p>Many Trump supporters have long lobbied for a resumption of nuclear testing, despite the existence of computer-based simulations as well as serious negative international consequences.</p><p>&quot;America must prepare to test nuclear weapons,&quot; the influential conservative think tank Heritage Foundation said in a report in January, referring to a &quot;deteriorating security environment&quot;.</p><p>Some experts said Trump&#39;s latest pronouncements were a gift to the governments of Russia and China.</p><p>In 2023, Putin ordered the Russian defence ministry and the nuclear agency Rosatom to &quot;ensure readiness for testing Russian nuclear weapons&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We know for certain that some figures in Washington are already considering the possibility of conducting live tests of their nuclear weapons,&quot; Putin said during his address to the Federal Assembly in February, 2023.</p><p>&quot;But if the US conducts tests, then we will too.&quot;</p><p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said on X that Trump&#39;s policy was &quot;incoherent: calling for denuclearisation talks one day; threatening nuclear tests the next&quot;.</p><p>The resumption of such tests &quot;could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,&quot; Kimball said.</p><p>fz-as/ah/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and will be taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>If confirmed, that would leave the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional development. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

citing &quot;increasing pressure and risks&quot;.</p><p>The All About Macau Media (AAMacau) news platform, co-founded by late journalist Ng Sio Ngai more than a decade ago, has often been critical of social issues in the Chinese city.</p><p>AAMacau, whose Chinese-language name means &quot;discuss as much as possible&quot;, runs digital and print platforms and also has a social media presence.</p><p>The outlet said this month&#39;s print edition would be its last, with the rest of its operation to end in December.</p><p>It said it had been told by Macau officials that it &quot;no longer meets the statutory requirements to engage in relevant activities&quot; under the Chinese special administrative region&#39;s media law and that its monthly publication registration number has been revoked.</p><p>&quot;Facing resource constraints, mounting external pressures, and the need for our reporters to navigate judicial proceedings, the team found it increasingly difficult to maintain reporting standards,&quot; AAMacau said.</p><p>It said it &quot;had no choice but to make this difficult decision&quot;.</p><p>In April, two AAMacau reporters were detained by police while covering an event in the city&#39;s legislature, which it said was the first case of its kind in Macau.</p><p>It said on Thursday that three of its journalists could face criminal charges over the incident.</p><p>The city&#39;s Government Information Bureau has not yet responded to an AFP request for comment.</p><p>- &#39;Swift deterioration&#39; -</p><p>Macau, which has its own legal system largely based on Portuguese law, enacted national security legislation in 2009 and widened its powers in 2023.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists said the closure of AAMacau is &quot;a blow to press freedom and a highly troubling development&quot;.</p><p>It &quot;marks a swift deterioration&quot; in Macau&#39;s media environment, the advocacy group told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

in a local newspaper in 2010, AAMacau established its website about two years later, followed by the first monthly magazine printed in May 2013.</p><p>In recent years, the outlet has transitioned into a subscription and donation-based funding model.</p><p>AAMacau said its decision came about a year after it started facing restrictions in accessing government events.</p><p>Political scientist and veteran journalist Eric Sautede called the outlet&#39;s closure an &quot;absolute loss&quot;.</p><p>He said AAMacau had &quot;helped foster a measure of accountability among those in power -- both in government and in the private sector&quot;.</p><p>twa/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump landed back in the United States Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued right as Trump was going into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>And it came days after Russia declared it had tested a nuclear-capable cruise missile and a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable sea drone.</p><p>The blunt statement from Trump, who boasts frequently about being a &quot;peace&quot; president, left much unanswered.</p><p>Chiefly, it was unclear whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions -- something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Regardless, the statement amounted to unusual nuclear sabre rattling.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>None of that appeared to be true.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- said China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. &quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the US do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus responded that she would introduce legislation to &quot;put a stop&quot; to any move at restoring live weapons testing in her state.</p><p>And Senator Jacky Rosen, also a Democrat, said on X that Trump&#39;s statement &quot;directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees... who&#39;ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen &amp; is unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>burs-sms/bgs</p></div></article></div>",
