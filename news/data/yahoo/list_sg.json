What isn’t pretty should be handled privately… or so she taught me, and her mom taught her, and so on and so forth. But the page is a place of connection. If I’m not fully present here, then what’s the point?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To put it bluntly, my organs are falling out. That’s a slight exaggeration. “Descending” is more accurate. However I frame it, it’s a disconcerting thought. My uterus, well, there’s a sign on that one that reads, “We’re done here!” But my bladder and my rectum, though performing their functions poorly, still seem necessary. I can’t have them planning their escapes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/husband-hearse-death-halloween-decoration_n_68f7bf30e4b0dbac45915c5d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Screamed When I Saw What Was Parked In Our Driveway.

Then I Learned My Husband Had Bought It.</a></strong></p><p><span>The news of my organs descending surprised me. Like many women following childbirth, I’ve struggled with “peezing” (a word contributed by Liz Lemon from “30 Rock”) and other mild forms of stress incontinence for a long time. But since my mid-40s, those problems have intensified alongside a more troubling inability to defecate completely.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So after probing in hard-to-reach places, a urogynecologist pronounces me prolapsed. According to a handout my doctor gave me&nbsp; by the American Urogynecologic Society, </span><a href=\"https://www.voicesforpfd.org/pelvic-organ-prolapse/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=6110279%2047&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADnw6TTmxw29Gm09-bivaxmjeyB4t&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpOfHBhAxEiw%20Am1SwEpakHT5P_zc6efgePsrh-R1MzRs68zTi821f6Q0qUShdC539CV5eJxoC1isQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:pelvic organ prolapse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>pelvic organ prolapse</span></a>, or POP,<span> “occurs when the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue weaken or tear. This causes the pelvic organs to fall downward into the vagina, similar to a hernia. Women may feel or see tissue coming out of the opening of their vagina as this progresses.” </span></p><p><span>POP can happen for a variety of reasons, among them muscle and nerve damage from pregnancy and childbirth, hormonal changes related to menopause, constant straining due to constipation, repeatedly lifting heavy objects and genetic predisposition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To investigate the possible relationship between my prolapsing organs and my constipation, my doctor suggests that I undergo what feels like a new level of humiliation called a defecography. It’s not like a colonoscopy, where you theoretically sleep through the entire thing. In this case, medical professionals watch you poop while you are alert and fully present, live and on-camera. The test reveals whether there is some anatomical reason why you can’t eliminate properly.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-ad-voiceover-actors-police_n_68fcfec8e4b011e8088689fa?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say</a></strong></p><p><span>I wonder if it’s worth it. Maybe I should just embrace my “pooping problem,” as my youngest calls it, and limp along without additional interventions. I can just live with the prolapses for now, right? It seems like the easiest and most peaceful route sometimes — just settling. But we all want more, don’t we? We want true healing. We want to feel better. We want to be fully restored.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I remain stubbornly curious about what </span><em><span>could </span></em><span>be, and schedule the test. But I give myself&nbsp;</span><span>permission to say “no” the morning of — “no” when I get there and see what awaits me, “no” when they ask me to… you get the idea. I’ve never used the “no,” but having it emboldens me to be braver than I am.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>My doctor suggests that I undergo what feels like a new level of humiliation called a defecography.

You suck down a bunch of barium and load yourself up vaginally with barium paste. The nurse then pages the radiologist: “The defo </span><em><span>(that’s me) </span></em><span>is ready.” She notices I’m listening to her —&nbsp;</span><em><span>What else would I be doing?&nbsp;</span></em><span>— and looks a little embarrassed. She apologizes quickly for referring to me as “defo,” saying it’s only to prepare the radiologist for what he’s about to do. I guess referring to me as a person is too much work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then the radiologist arrives, explains the process, and inserts a large amount of barium paste into my rectum via syringe. If you have other anal issues like I do…a fissure, hemorrhoids, that last part is especially unpleasant. It’s hard not to feel violated unless your radiologist is gifted with an unusual amount of finesse. Mine was not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-hospice-coping-dying-parent_n_68dc0865e4b0d2dd31581907?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You</a></strong></p><p><span>Next is the fun part. You sit on an elevated platform sporting a special commode. With the radiologist and nurse next to you, you defecate on camera and on command. The radiologist stares at a screen to judge how well you eliminate and gathers evidence revealing why you cannot void completely. In my case, he found that my uterus descends and pinches off part of my rectum when I bear down, so I can only partially evacuate. Hooray? Maybe. I cry all the way home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I see my urogynecologist several weeks later, she’s elated: “I’m so glad that I can do something to help you!” </span><em><span>She’s a good doctor. </span></em><span>She explains that she’d like to insert a silicone device called a pessary up into my vagina. It’s designed to hold up my uterus and prevent it from pinching off my rectum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The pessary looks like a mushroom with a top that secures via suction and a long stem that extends down to my vaginal opening. Once I’ve assumed the position, she requests that I ready myself and relax. </span><em><span>That doesn’t bode well. </span></em><span>With significant force, she installs the medieval workhorse. According to the nurses, she “places” the pessary, but what I experience feels more like a pain-inducing shove. I arrive home feeling like I’ve got a tampon protruding and a little askew. I’m supposed to function like this for 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, the pessary changes nothing. The pooping problem persists. My urogynecologist explains that she could still surgically fix the prolapses, pin up or remove my uterus, in hopes that stooling would improve. She looks at me: “What do </span><em><span>you </span></em><span>think we should do?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fundamental-christian-university-job-spank-kids_n_68fe1ed8e4b0049ce5fd2e27?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler</a></strong></p><p><span>My internal response is paradoxical. One part of me screams, </span><em><span>What!?! YOU are supposed to be the expert! Why are you asking ME!?! </span></em><span>The other ruminates, </span><em><span>Thank you for acknowledging that I might have some wisdom to contribute.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span>“I’ll have to think about it.”</span></p><p><span>The end? Not really, and I hope not. But this is where we all are a lot of time. In between. In process. Unresolved. We all wander around hurting sometimes and can’t fix it. We’re all trying to make meaning of suffering while we wait for change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But wherever this path takes me, I’m done with pretty and private. I’m done with the societal expectation that women’s bodies should look the same regardless of the trauma they have sustained, that aging should be invisible. My body is a ragged landscape of stories that I think I’m meant to tell. I am more than pretty. I am wildly, uncomfortably, unapologetically, fearfully resilient.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mom-period-menstruation-sons-shame_n_68fbad78e4b004dff450f288?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why I Am Teaching My Young Sons That This &#39;Private&#39; Bathroom Topic Is &#39;No Big Deal&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Why I Am Teaching My Young Sons That This &#39;Private&#39; Bathroom Topic Is &#39;No Big Deal&#39;</a></strong></p><p><span>And so are you.</span></p><p><em>Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

It also conducted about 10 combined exercise planning meetings.</p><p>To ensure safety and prevent mid-air collisions, aircraft was also separated into blocks of airspace at different heights, and there were clear processes for transit lanes, said Lieutenant Colonel Dai Jing, who is ops officer for 6 Div/HQ SS.</p><p>“We made sure everybody knew their roles very well and was well-coordinated, such that when we brought everything together and executed it together, it was safe, but also operationally to standard,” she added.</p><p>The SAF also trialled the use of rapid 3D-mapping technology to help its tactical troops achieve near real-time visualisation of the urban environment they were operating in.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height:

valuable, given that it is not something that can be done in Singapore, added MAJ Chin, who is commanding officer of 23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery.</p><p>MAJ Lee, the F-16 pilot, concurred, noting that Shoalwater Bay had urban operations training facilities, jungle terrain, as well as mountainous areas, which allowed the RSAF and army to work towards shared objectives.</p><p>“The challenge is mainly that we don’t have a lot of experience with the army, so there were a lot of communications issues at the start, but then we worked through them and sorted out our differences during the exercise,” he said.</p><p>He added: “It’s a good opportunity for us, because it’s one of the rare exercises that we get to interact with the army controllers.</p><p>“So we get to learn their lingo, run through the processes with them and improve on those so we get familiar with how to support them in their missions.”</p><p><a

deficit,&nbsp;the French economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.</p><p>The surprise was thanks to a jump in investments and exports &quot;in part because of a strong aerospace sector, which

quarter.</p><p>But Germany, Europe&#39;s biggest economy, stagnated in the same period although it narrowly dodged a recession.</p><p>The Italian economy also failed to grow between July and September.</p><p>- German struggles -</p><p>In September, the ECB raised its growth forecast for 2025 to 1.2 percent.</p><p>Despite eking out growth in the third quarter, economists warned against

up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.</p><p>Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/cuomo-new-york-mayor-campaign?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:relaunched his mayoral

to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.</p><p>Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism and despair about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-preparations?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani</a>.

The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>And in a <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters</a> released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 18%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.</p><p>With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23><noscript><img alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Voters cast their ballots during New York's early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York's Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.</p><p>“We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”</p><p>Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.</p><p>The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).</p><p>Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.</p><p>In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:laughed with a radio host;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">laughed with a radio host</a> who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11.

In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.</p><p>“I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/politics/andrew-cuomo-resigns?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cuomo resigned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Cuomo resigned</a> in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.</p><p>He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.</p><p>“I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi <a href=\"https://x.com/Tom_Suozzi/status/1983572963346845756\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on X</a>. “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”</p><h3>Embracing his inner influencer</h3><p>As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.</p><p>Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.</p><p>“It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.</p><p>Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.</p><p>“He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571><noscript><img alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.</p><p>At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.</p><h3>Experience, experience, experience</h3><p>Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.</p><p>Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-police-nypd-defund?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mamdani’s police reform agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mamdani’s police reform agenda</a> would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.</p><p>The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.</p><p>On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.</p><p>“You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.</p><p>CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

analysts said, and drew cautious optimism on the streets of Beijing (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>A rare meeting between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping has succeeded in temporarily stabilising US-China relations, analysts said on Thursday, with the talks drawing cautious optimism on the streets of Beijing.</p><p>A beaming Trump hailed the talks as a &quot;great success&quot;, while Xi said China had reached a &quot;consensus&quot; with the United States on trade and economic issues.</p><p>Beijing and Washington have been locked in a blistering trade war, encompassing everything from rare earths to soybeans and port fees, which has rocked markets for months.</p><p>&quot;Although there hasn&#39;t been a complete agreement, at least in the short term, there&#39;s been a suspension of tariff increases,&quot; 35-year-old media worker Yan told AFP outside a shopping mall in China&#39;s capital.</p><p>Dylan Loh from Singapore&#39;s Nanyang Technological University said the meeting was &quot;significant&quot; because it tackled a range of both longstanding and newly emerged roadblocks in the trade relationship.</p><p>&quot;The conciliatory words used by both leaders are important, as they signal that there is room to steer the relationship back toward a more normal footing,&quot; Loh told AFP.</p><p>Both sides appear to have moved on key sticking points.</p><p>A decision by China to suspend certain export restrictions on rare earths &quot;did a lot of magic&quot;, and Washington easing fentanyl-related tariffs &quot;helps plenty too&quot;, said Lim Tai Wei, professor and East Asia expert at Japan&#39;s Soka University.</p><p>Xi&#39;s language with Trump struck a &quot;notably constructive&quot; tone, said Yue Su of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</p><p>&quot;While structural competition remains evident... both leaders appear willing to find common ground and stabilise the relationship,&quot; Su told AFP.</p><p>- Long-term concerns? -</p><p>Beijing residents told AFP on Thursday they hoped to see a knock-on effect from the talks.</p><p>Gym owner Ma Ning said she thought the meeting improved &quot;very tense&quot; relations between the two countries.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Good relations between the two sides are good for China,&quot; the 30-year-old said, adding she hoped the meeting would improve China&#39;s &quot;sluggish economy&quot;.</p><p>Media worker Yan hoped to see the price of regular goods go down after the tariff reductions.</p><p>But he worried Trump&#39;s &quot;unstable&quot; personality might undermine longer-term solutions.</p><p>While the outcomes from Thursday&#39;s meeting were positive, analysts said there were &quot;no surprises&quot;, especially with the two leaders avoiding more sensitive topics.</p><p>Trump said Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory, was not discussed.</p><p>&quot;By the time the two sides meet again, US-China negotiations will likely enter truly deep waters,&quot; the EIU&#39;s Su said.</p><p>&quot;Issues such as Taiwan, market access, and national security will test how much genuine willingness both sides have to pressure the other into making concessions on their own priorities.&quot;</p><p>Either country could also decide, at some point, to walk back on the specific decisions announced on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;There is the issue of one or both sides changing their minds or accusing the other side of not acting in good faith,&quot; said Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve seen this before... in recent years,&quot; Chong told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Trump also appears to prefer negotiating and renegotiating to keep interlocutors on the back foot,&quot; he said.</p><p>isk-sam/reb/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.</p><p>The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.</p><p>Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.</p><p>“Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.</p><p>The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/business/rare-earth-minerals-trump-china-xi?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\"

for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.</p><p>In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.</p><p>Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.</p><p>China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.</p><p>One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.</p><p>On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.</p><p>The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.</p><p>“We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.</p><h3>Troubled trade</h3><p>The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.</p><p>At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.</p><p>Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.</p><p>Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.</p><p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”</p><p>Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.</p><p>Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.</p><p>But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.</p><p>Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.</p><p>The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.</p><p>CNN’s John Liu contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
