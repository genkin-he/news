At the dinner table, my stories would meander. My mom tells me my stories had branches and my branches had branches. She says I loved to tell the same story over and over, which charmed her, but my dad got impatient. I could tell when he trailed off. He’d look away or at his food or sometimes change the subject. I always wanted more of his time and attention. I always felt rejected.</p><p>When I started competing in sports, he tuned in more, but it was still my mom who took me to tennis tournaments on the weekends and sat in the stands while I won or lost and then celebrated or consoled me during the car rides home.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-history-father-doctors-visits_n_699dcb46e4b0689d85504b69?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:My Father Emotionally Abandoned Our Family — And I Have To Relive It Every Time I Go To The Doctor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">My Father Emotionally Abandoned Our Family — And I Have To Relive It Every Time I Go To The Doctor</a></strong></p><p>When I talk to Tony about our childhood, he agrees that our parents consisted mostly of our mom.

He worked every day, including half days on Saturdays, and drove an hour each way to his optometric office downtown. He provided. He was kind.

I sat on the end of my mom’s bed talking to my mom about how afraid I was to leave home. My dad was lying back, watching a game on TV, one of his full-time positions. I was sure he wasn’t listening, and then, without taking his eyes off the game, he told me I’d be all right on the day I left. “Fantasy,” he said, “is always better or worse than reality.”</p><p>The summer after my first year of college, I knew my mom told my dad I’d had *** for the first time with my old high school boyfriend. I’d told my mom I wasn’t in love, but he was a good guy and I didn’t want to die an old maid. A few nights later, my dad fixed me a drink, vodka on the rocks, and motioned for me to join him on a balcony at a family party. I felt awkward, looking over the marina in Coconut Grove. I was 19. We’d never shared a drink together. We’d never hung out, just the two of us, for the purpose of talking. He was cool, and in his Zen-like way he said, “It’s better to love than be loved.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 437px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:69%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4pTj6VOX3X1AyAysoyd2vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4ebf156b38ecd68157a23ed35cfc18c3><noscript><img alt=\"The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4pTj6VOX3X1AyAysoyd2vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4ebf156b38ecd68157a23ed35cfc18c3 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><em>Like this article?

About 35 years ago, my dad left optometry and started a commercial real-estate business. Soon, Tony joined him and the two became partners and bought properties and rented out warehouse spaces. My dad was the guy who negotiated with banks and buyers. He understood interest rates, percentages and people. He did stacks — a financial breakdown of cash in, minus expenses on management and maintenance — with a pencil and paper. He could remember a stack on a property — on multiple properties — from year to year. He never used a calculator.</p><p>Tony says he learned everything about business and managing people from my dad. Now, he says, they think exactly alike.</p><p>Tony called me yesterday after taking my dad to Flanigan’s for dinner. The waiter told Tony that my dad’s aide brought him earlier that day for lunch.</p><p>I asked, “Did he have a cheeseburger?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What did he have for lunch?”</p><p>“A cheeseburger!”</p><p>We both laughed until Tony said. “This is rough.”</p><p>Tony was the first to notice my dad wasn’t on his game. It was five or so years ago in a meeting with their accountant. My dad did a stack, but couldn’t remember he’d just done it. He wasn’t able to evaluate the stack against the previous year. He repeated himself.</p><p>These days, Tony will occasionally consult my dad to keep him involved in the business and to test his own logic. But he feels alone now. Tony lost his mentor and his mate.</p><p>My dad knows he can’t remember what he did this morning or how to get to my house, but when I ask if he’s stressed about his memory, he says, “What can I do?”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 778px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:123%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author and her dad in 2025.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xV6GbrG_9flbF31iA1dUVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTM0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b1117a184ae4f5711d7044c348f1d25d><noscript><img alt=\"The author and her dad in 2025.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xV6GbrG_9flbF31iA1dUVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTM0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b1117a184ae4f5711d7044c348f1d25d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author and her dad in 2025. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>When I was a kid, I wanted my dad to listen to my stories about what my teachers said in class and what I did with my friends on the weekends, but that wasn’t my dad.

change in order to win self-determination for the Kurds.</p><p>Iraq&#39;s autonomous Kurdistan region has long been a haven for Kurdish Iranian armed factions, which have repeatedly faced cross-border strikes from Iran.</p><p>&quot;We cannot take the side of either the Americans or the Iranians. Our cause is different... our goal is democratic change in Iran -- a democracy that will benefit the Kurdish people,&quot; said Mazloum Haftan, a senior commander in the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK).</p><p>&quot;We will neither attack Iran nor defend the current regime. We have chosen a third path: working towards democratic, peaceful change,&quot; the 54-year-old added.</p><p>An AFP team of journalists met Haftan and his fellow fighters in a bunker carved into a rugged mountainous area, now blanketed with snow, near the border with Iran.</p><p>Iran has designated his group as a terrorist organisation, and many Iranian Kurdish groups like his have previously fought Iranian security forces in Kurdish-majority areas along the border.</p><p>But in recent years, they have largely refrained from armed activity, although they continue to actively campaign from exile against the Islamic republic.</p><p>They recently stepped up their lobbying after mass anti-government protests in Iran that sparked a deadly crackdown, and as the United States conducted a military build-up in the region not seen in decades.</p><p>- &#39;With blood&#39; -</p><p>If war breaks out, Haftan said he believes Iran might target Kurdish opposition positions in northern Iraq.</p><p>He also said Iranian authorities have already started boosting their security and military presence in Kurdish-majority areas of western Iran.</p><p>The impact of any US strikes would very much depend on how far they go. Should they go as far as effecting regime change, Haftan said groups like his would aim for &quot;a decentralised system after having tried the monarchy and the Supreme Leader rule&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Last week, the PJAK and another four exiled groups announced&nbsp;a political coalition to seek the overthrow of Iran&#39;s Islamic republic and ultimately to secure Kurdish self-determination.</p><p>Kurdish opposition groups have long supported anti-government protests in Iran.&nbsp;Last month, they called for a general strike in support of the demonstrations.</p><p>In 2022, Iran launched deadly military strikes on exiled Kurdish Iranian militants, accusing them of instigating protests sparked by the death in custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini.</p><p>In Iran, &quot;the Kurds have been at the forefront of the struggle for democracy and freedom. When one leads people, one must pay a price—we have paid in blood,&quot; Haftan said.</p><p>- &#39;An opportunity&#39; -</p><p>The Kurds, whose community spans areas of Turkey through Syria, Iraq and Iran, make up one of Iran&#39;s most important non-Persian ethnic minority groups.</p><p>The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) is one of the oldest and biggest Kurdish Iranian opposition groups, and it has lost fighters and commanders, including three of its chiefs, to Iranian fire.</p><p>Despite his enmity with the Iranian state, PDKI commander Mohammed Nazif Kader told AFP over the phone his group has not supported Israeli or American attacks on the Islamic republic.</p><p>&quot;Our coalition relies on the Iranian people, especially the Kurds,&quot; he said.</p><p>But &quot;if a war breaks out, it will likely create an opportunity for the Iranian opposition to return&quot; and &quot;seek to establish a democratic system&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We are on full alert and fully prepared... and for all forms of struggle,&quot; he added.</p><p>str/rh/ser</p></div></article></div>",

slain opposition figure Boris Nemtsov.</p><p>The symbolism was almost too much.</p><p>Four years into Moscow&#39;s full-scale offensive on Ukraine, which has seen President Vladimir Putin eradicate all forms of dissent and usher in strict military censorship laws that have silenced his critics, few Russians dared, or wanted, to pay tribute.</p><p>Nemtsov, a longtime Putin opponent, was shot and killed on February 27 2015, metres from the Kremlin&#39;s red walls. He was 55.</p><p>Hundreds used to flock to the makeshift memorial on the anniversary of his death, which came on Friday.</p><p>This year, there was barely a trickle.

Still, his murder shocked the country and the world.</p><p>&quot;The hopes of the whole country were pinned on him -- of all the people who wanted it to be free here,&quot; said Olga Vinogradova, a 66-year-old volunteer who tends to the pop-up memorial to Nemtsov on the bridge.</p><p>&quot;When this man was killed, naturally, all of us were, we were all just executed at that moment. Because our hopes were destroyed,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;With this memorial, we remind people that there was a different path for Russia. And that there was a real person who could have led us down this path.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Forced out&#39; -</p><p>Nemtsov had strongly opposed Putin&#39;s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and Moscow&#39;s military backing for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>He was also a close and early ally of Alexei Navalny, who died in 2024 in an Arctic prison in what his supports say was a poisoning.</p><p>Open opposition to the Kremlin is unheard of inside Russia since the first days of the Ukraine offensive -- when riot police cracked down hard on the thousands that took to the streets to protest.</p><p>All major critics of the Kremlin are in exile, prison or dead.</p><p>Those that remain have been silenced.</p><p>&quot;Many have been forced out of the country, some have been killed,&quot; said Gleb, a 23-year-old photographer.</p><p>A movement or person like Nemtsov was &quot;impossible&quot; to imagine right now, he said.</p><p>Still, he held on to a slither of hope.</p><p>&quot;But everything can change at any moment.&quot;</p><p>bur/jxb</p></div></article></div>",

neighbours at &quot;open war&quot; following months of tit-for-tat clashes.</p><p>AFP reporters in Kabul and Kandahar heard blasts and jets overhead until dawn, and the Taliban government said Pakistani surveillance&nbsp;aircraft were flying over Afghanistan on Friday afternoon.</p><p>The overnight operation was Pakistan&#39;s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Near the key Torkham border crossing, an AFP journalist heard shelling on Friday morning, and a camp accommodating Afghans who had returned from Pakistan was hit by the fighting overnight.</p><p>&quot;Children, women, and old people were running,&quot; Gander Khan, a 65-year-old returnee, told AFP in front of rows of tents at the Omari camp.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s latest operation came after Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops on Thursday night in retaliation for earlier air strikes by Islamabad.</p><p>Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured several others, while putting the death toll among Afghan troops at 13.</p><p>The head of the Pakistan military&#39;s publicity wing, Lieutenant General&nbsp;Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, told reporters &quot;274 Taliban regime members and terrorists&quot; had been killed, for the loss of 12 Pakistani troops.</p><p>Casualty claims from both sides are difficult to verify independently.</p><p>- Relations plunge -</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Most of the attacks have been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has stepped up assaults in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

repeatedly emphasised a peaceful solution, and still want the problem to be resolved through dialogue,&quot; Mujahid told a news conference, adding: &quot;Right now, Pakistani planes, reconnaissance aircraft, are flying over Afghanistan&#39;s airspace.&quot;</p><p>- Delicate ceasefire broken -</p><p>The overnight strikes mark a &quot;significant and dangerous escalation from earlier clashes&quot;, South Asia expert Michael Kugelman said on X.</p><p>&quot;Pakistan appears to have expanded its targeting beyond TTP to the Taliban regime itself,&quot; he said.</p><p>Several rounds of negotiations between Islamabad and Kabul followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.</p><p>After repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.</p><p>Iran, which shares an eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, offered on Friday to help &quot;facilitate dialogue&quot;, while the Saudi foreign minister spoke with his Pakistani counterpart and China said it was &quot;working with&quot; both countries while calling for calm.</p><p>An AFP reporter in Kandahar, where Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada is based, also heard jets overnight and drones on Friday evening.</p><p>- Capital streets quiet -</p><p>Streets in Kabul were quiet after daybreak, in keeping with a Friday during Ramadan in the Muslim-majority nation.</p><p>At the camp for returnees near Torkham, multiple civilians were wounded in a Pakistan strike, Nangarhar provincial official Qureshi Badlun said.</p><p>One woman was killed and several others were hospitalised, according to provincial public health spokesman Naqibullah Rahimi.</p><p>Spokesman Mujahid told AFP that several Pakistani soldiers had been &quot;caught alive&quot;, a claim denied by the prime minister&#39;s office in Islamabad.</p><p>The military operation follows recent Pakistan strikes on Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, which the UN mission in Afghanistan said killed at least 13 civilians.</p><p>Besides military operations, there has been a series of deadly suicide blasts in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent months.</p><p>They included an attack on a Shiite mosque in Islamabad&nbsp;that killed at least 40 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group.</p><p>The militant group&#39;s regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a restaurant in Kabul last

provisionally apply the Mercosur trade deal (Simon Wohlfahrt)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The European Commission announced Friday it will provisionally implement a mammoth trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur, prompting a public split between its two largest member states France and Germany.</p><p>EU chief Ursula von der Leyen announced the bloc would go forward with agreement pending the EU top court&#39;s ruling on its legality after Argentina and Uruguay ratified the agreement Thursday.</p><p>&quot;The commission will now proceed with provisional application,&quot; von der Leyen said in Brussels, recalling that member states had given the EU executive power to do so.</p><p>&quot;Provisional application is, by its nature, provisional,&quot; she added, saying: &quot;The agreement can only be fully concluded once the European Parliament has given its consent.&quot;</p><p>She hailed the ratification by the two South American countries as &quot;good news&quot;.</p><p>The deal still needs a green light from lawmakers in the European Parliament, which referred it to the EU&#39;s top court within days of being inked in January.</p><p>France has led opposition to the deal and unsuccessfully attempted to block it over worries for its farmers, who fear being undercut by&nbsp;cheaper goods from Brazil and its neighbours.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision a &quot;bad surprise&quot; that ignored the European Parliament, but Germany and Spain welcomed the step.</p><p>&quot;Companies and people from both continents can finally benefit from more prosperity and growth,&quot; German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p><p>- EU &#39;empowered&#39; to decide -</p><p>Provisional application will begin on &quot;the first day of the second month following the date on which the EU and Uruguay (as first Mercosur country to ratify) exchange notes verbales&quot;, EU trade spokesman Olof Gill later clarified.</p><p>French agriculture minister Annie Genevard said the decision was &quot;very damaging to the functioning of our institutions and, above all, to the spirit of our European institutions&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But Gill said EU states had &quot;empowered&quot; the commission to take such a decision.</p><p>The deal will provisionally apply to the Mercosur countries that have ratified it, Gill told reporters, adding the commission anticipated remaining members Brazil and Paraguay would do so &quot;soon&quot;.</p><p>Reacting to von der Leyen&#39;s announcement, French EU lawmaker Celine Imart accused the commission of &quot;showing contempt&quot; for farmers.</p><p>&quot;We will continue to fight with determination to ensure that this provisional application never becomes permanent,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>- Agriculture worries -</p><p>The deal between the EU and the four founding members of the Mercosur bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- was a quarter century in the making.</p><p>The accord creates one of the world&#39;s biggest free trade zones and eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of trade between the two blocs, which together account for 30 percent of global GDP and over 700 million consumers.</p><p>Farmers across Europe remain unconvinced and are up in arms, including in Spain where they staged a protest against the deal in Madrid earlier this month.</p><p>The European Commission, however, insists it has fully addressed their concerns by approving a series of safeguards for its producers.</p><p>Von der Leyen stressed the deal offered &quot;countless opportunities&quot;.</p><p>She added: &quot;It allows our small and medium-sized businesses to access markets and scale they could only dream of before.&quot;</p><p>Major exports from the South American grouping to the EU include agricultural products and minerals, while the 27-country bloc would export machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals with smaller levies.</p><p>burs-ob-raz/rl</p></div></article></div>",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga</p><p>TIRANA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Social media platform TikTok is back in Albania after a year-long ban expired this month, in a case illustrating the complexity of imposing bans in a politically fragmented region ‌and sparking questions over online safety and censorship.</p><p>The ban, imposed last year and ostensibly linked to the death of a ‌teenage boy after bullying online, saw Chinese-owned short video platform TikTok banned for all users. The government says TikTok has now tightened safety measures sufficiently.</p><p>But the case is ​complex in a country hit by unrest over political corruption and where the ruling party is in an unprecedented fourth term in power. Opposition parties accuse the government of trying to silence them by banning the platform weeks before parliamentary elections last year.</p><p>The government of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama told Reuters that TikTok had taken steps to address issues that it had raised and said the ban helped put pressure on the ‌platform.</p><p>&quot;With its correct behavior toward our concerns, TikTok ⁠confirmed to us the expression that &#39;the devil is not as black as it seems&#39;,&quot; the government said in a statement, adding it had put in place &quot;important filters for security and language&quot;.</p><p>TikTok declined to comment. The ⁠government said there was &quot;no connection&quot; between the TikTok ban and election interference and that the &quot;only goal&quot; had been to protect children.</p><p>ONLINE SAFETY OR CENSORSHIP?</p><p>TikTok was suspended in Albania after a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death by a fellow pupil, a crime that local media reports said occurred after the ​two had ​clashed online. At the time TikTok said the clash did not originate ​on their platform.</p><p>It also came weeks before a crunch ‌parliamentary election.</p><p>&quot;The shutdown of TikTok was certainly a move by the Rama government to manipulate public opinion,&quot; said Edona Haklaj from the small party Shqiperia Behet that has been holding daily protests in front of Rama&#39;s office since early December. She did not give any concrete proof for her assertion.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Albania has been marred in recent months by violent protests between police and the main opposition Democratic Party, demanding the resignation of the government after deputy PM Belinda Balluku was indicted for manipulating public tenders.</p><p>Late on Thursday Rama, in power since 2013, fired Balluku, though ‌the opposition has pledged to still hold protests on Saturday. Activists worry ​the TikTok ban - even if lifted - could be used to justify further blocks amid ​rising tensions.</p><p>&quot;This will create a dangerous precedent,&quot; said Isa Myzyraj, ​the president of the Association of the Albanian Journalists. &quot;Any government could exploit this precedent to block other social ‌networks or even impose a total internet shutdown.&quot;</p><p>Brenton Benja, ​founder of Geek Room Albania who ​tracked the ban, cautioned that the measure had had limited impact as people used VPNs to skirt controls - a signal of the wider challenge of imposing social media bans on increasingly tech-savvy users.</p><p>The government also acknowledged in its statement that a full ​ban had proved &quot;impossible&quot; because of technological hurdles.</p><p>&quot;The 1.7 ‌million Albanians we knew were using TikTok at the time it was closed continued to use it throughout the ​year by turning to alternative methods such as VPNs,&quot; Benja said.</p><p>(Reporting by Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga; Additional reporting ​by Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by Ivana Sekularac, Adam Jourdan and Hugh Lawson)</p></div></article></div>",
