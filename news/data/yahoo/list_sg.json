class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Clinton features prominently throughout the latest Epstein files disclosures, with the former president denying any wrongdoing (HANDOUT)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former US president Bill Clinton denied wrongdoing Friday to a congressional panel probing his links to Jeffrey Epstein, before calling on others to testify as Democrats seek to shift focus onto Donald Trump&#39;s ties to the sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently in the Epstein files but insists that he broke ties well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>&quot;I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,&quot; Clinton said in his opening statement, shared on social media.</p><p>The Republican chair of the House committee probing Epstein, James Comer, said &quot;we believe this was a very productive deposition that President Clinton answered every question -- or attempted to answer every question.&quot;</p><p>Comer&#39;s Republican colleague Nancy Mace alleged there were &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in his testimony without providing specific examples.</p><p>Democrats on the committee have reiterated their call for Trump, who also has well-documented links to Epstein, to be quizzed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be real, we are talking to the wrong president,&quot; said Democratic committee member Suhas&nbsp;Subramanyam, who also emphasized that Clinton had not dodged any questions.</p><p>In his statement, Clinton did not name Trump directly but said &quot;no person is above the law, even presidents -- especially presidents.&quot;</p><p>As for Trump, he repeated his skepticism over the whole process, telling reporters he likes Clinton &quot;and I don&#39;t like seeing him deposed.&quot;</p><p>In a video statement he posted late Friday on X, Clinton appeared to criticize the process in which he had been asked to testify but others had not, warning against the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.</p><p>&quot;I hope that by being here today, we can bring ourselves just a little further from the brink, and back to being a country where we can disagree civilly and we can search for truth and justice, and it outweighs the partisan urge to score points and create spectacle,&quot; he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I hope it will motivate everyone to go in front of Congress to say what they know,&quot; he said, without naming anyone.</p><p>Being mentioned in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing and Clinton -- like Trump -- has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>Clinton follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday and defiantly called for Trump to appear before the panel.</p><p>The lawmakers should ask Trump &quot;directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors, with Bill Clinton likening the proceedings to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot; The couple has called for them to be open and televised.</p><p>Hillary Clinton said she had never known Epstein or visited the properties where he hosted world celebrities and powerful business and political figures -- as well as allegedly trafficking young women and girls.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein but said he never visited the financier&#39;s infamous private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14, but died in a New York jail cell in 2019 before he could be tried on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but like much else around Epstein is the subject of lurid conspiracy theories.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- &#39;Turned him in&#39; -</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing Bill Clinton reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein was in the White House 17 times while Bill Clinton was President. We know that Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane at least 27 times. So those are questions that we&#39;re going to ask,&quot; said Comer.</p><p>Clinton said in his opening statement &quot;not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing -- I would have turned him in.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, home to the Clintons, where dozens of journalists and Secret Service officers have converged.</p><p>pel-gw/sms/jfx/ane</p></div></article></div>",

deposition.</p> - Clipped From Video</figcaption></div></figure><p>Bill Clinton on Friday denied having any knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes during what he said was the pair’s “brief acquaintance” under more than six hours of questioning from lawmakers who sought to unravel the former president’s ties to the late convicted sex offender.</p><p>Repeatedly, lawmakers showed Clinton photos of himself with women from Epstein materials recently released by the Justice Department, asking if he had sex with them. Each time, he told them he did not, two sources familiar with the testimony said.</p><p>At one point, the panel homed in on a particularly well-known photo of Clinton in a jacuzzi with a woman, her face redacted. Clinton said he did not know her, and he denied having sex with her, two sources said.</p><p>Lawmakers of both parties said Clinton answered every question posed to him, and the former president broadly denied wrongdoing.</p><p>“I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,” Clinton said in his opening statement to the House Oversight Committee, shared publicly on social media. “I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn’t see. I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn’t do. I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.”</p><p>But the questioning about his sexual activities underscored how Clinton’s past ties to Epstein have come to haunt him and his family.</p><p>Clinton’s testimony capped a high-profile two days in the Republican-led panel’s Epstein inquiry, following the sworn testimony of his wife <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the day before;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the day before</a>.</p><p>The former president defended Hillary Clinton in a video statement after his deposition. “I also have to say something personal. Republicans made Hillary testify yesterday, and she had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of ever even meeting him,” he said in the <a href=\"https://x.com/BillClinton/status/2027582699251048660\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">video</a>. “She neither traveled with him, nor visited any of his property. So whether 10 people or 10,000 people were subpoenaed, including her, was simply not right.”</p><p>The appearance saw lawmakers trek to Chappaqua, New York, to avoid the spectacle of a former president testifying under oath in Washington. But Clinton’s deposition behind closed doors was no less historic. He became the first former president compelled to testify under subpoena before a congressional committee, setting a new precedent that could have sweeping ramifications, including for President Donald Trump.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Attorneys for the Clintons and the Republican-led panel negotiated behind the scenes – through email exchanges, letters and phone calls – for months over the terms of the interview. Ultimately, the pair only agreed to comply with their subpoenas after the House had moved toward a bipartisan vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear as scheduled.</p><p>“I think everybody would agree that he’s been very cooperative, and he’s actually answering the questions fairly to the best of his ability. He has not taken a pass on pleading the fifth for any questions,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, said of Clinton.</p><p>Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the panel, said Clinton flashed “Southern people skills.”</p><p>“He’s a charming individual, obviously,” Comer said.</p><p>Unlike his wife, who testified on Thursday that she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:never met;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">never met</a> Epstein, Clinton has a documented history of interactions with him and Ghislaine Maxwell – who was convicted in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for &#x00201c;The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.&quot; - Clinton Presidential Library\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y3Fdpj9iKnlN2aI30AiZRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ddd28c5870a095749c7c5843f9a23551><noscript><img alt=\"Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for &#x00201c;The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.&quot; - Clinton Presidential Library\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y3Fdpj9iKnlN2aI30AiZRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ddd28c5870a095749c7c5843f9a23551 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Then-President Clinton is pictured with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a reception for “The Donors to the White House Restoration Project of 1993.\" - Clinton Presidential Library</figcaption></div></figure><p>The panel inquired about Clinton’s name appearing in the flight logs of Epstein’s plane, and about Epstein’s name appearing in Clinton’s White House visitors logs, two sources familiar with the testimony told CNN.</p><p>Clinton voluntarily recounted to the House investigators that Trump told him in the early 2000s at a golf tournament that he had a falling out with Epstein over a land deal, three sources familiar with the testimony told CNN.</p><p>Trump said he was no longer friends with Epstein, Clinton recalled, according to those sources. It was the former president who volunteered his recollection of that conversation, one of the sources said.</p><p>In his opening statement, Clinton said that “no matter how many photos you show (him),” it would not change his assertion that he saw nothing wrong and did nothing wrong.</p><p>And addressing the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/24/politics/kfile-ghislaine-maxwell-clinton-conference-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:more than a dozen times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">more than a dozen times</a> he traveled with his staffers on Epstein’s private plane between 2001 and 2004, Clinton said: “As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing—I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals.”</p><p>The former president is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/epstein-files-release-doj-01-30-26?post-id=cml17hk2q00003b6pj25vyt1l&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:listed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">listed</a> on a 2025 FBI document that compiled a list of more than a dozen sexual assault allegations, including against Trump, that appear to be unverified.</p><p>Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein.

Shah Alam’s son told Reuters the arrest was the result of a misunderstanding with police officers.</p><p>He had gone for a walk using a curtain rod as a walking stick, became lost and wandered onto private property, Faisal told Reuters. While on the property, the police report said, he damaged a shed door and “allowed the homeowner’s dog to escape through an open gate.”</p><p>When officers arrived and ordered Shah Alam to drop the rod, he did not comply because he did not understand them, his son said.</p><p>Body camera video obtained by CNN shows Shah Alam holding what appears to be two long black sticks in the backyard of a home when two female officers approach him and one yells, “Hey, what are you doing?”</p><p>Shah Alam doesn’t immediately say anything and one officer gets closer to him, yelling “drop it” three times. Shah Alam, then walking slowly toward the officers, says “OK sorry” several times as the officers continue to command he put the sticks down and warn they’ll use their stun guns if he doesn’t comply.</p><p>About a minute passes before the officers fire their stun guns, Shah Alam is seen waving the sticks in the air while speaking another language, and the officers tackle him.</p><p>Two officers suffered minor injuries, according to the police report, which also said Shah Alam bit one officer on the arm and another on the hand while they took him into custody. The video doesn’t clearly depict that moment, but it shows the officers struggling for some time with Shah Alam and punching him on the head multiple times as they attempt to restrain him.</p><p>He was later indicted on felony assault, burglary and criminal mischief charges, the Erie County District Attorney’s Office said.</p><p>Earlier this month, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges: criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree and criminal trespass in the third degree. Sentencing was scheduled for March 24.</p><p>Erie County District Attorney Michael Keane said his office reduced the charges after considering Shah Alam’s medical condition, time served and the “significant collateral consequences that would result from a felony conviction — including mandatory deportation.”</p><p><strong>What we don’t know:</strong></p><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p>Did Shah Alam consistently have access to a translator during his year in custody?</p></li><li><p>Was his visual impairment or other health issues documented in internal jail records?</p></li></ul><h3>Why was he released from jail?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Activists gather Thursday in the Elmwood Village neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, following the death of Nurul Amin Shah Alam, a nearly blind refugee from Myanmar. - Craig Ruttle/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.Nk.m0vFeSH59LKBFnW8KQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/00b5fec89ba0690e596dd89caa913cf2><noscript><img alt=\"Activists gather Thursday in the Elmwood Village neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, following the death of Nurul Amin Shah Alam, a nearly blind refugee from Myanmar. - Craig Ruttle/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.Nk.m0vFeSH59LKBFnW8KQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/00b5fec89ba0690e596dd89caa913cf2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Activists gather Thursday in the Elmwood Village neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, following the death of Nurul Amin Shah Alam, a nearly blind refugee from Myanmar. - Craig Ruttle/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Shah Alam’s bond had been set at $5,000. His family initially declined to post bail, fearing a federal immigration detainer would result in his transfer to immigration custody, according to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1497037545758474&amp;set=pcb.1497038885758340\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo</a>, which represented Shah Alam.</p><p>Following the plea deal, an immigration lawyer was consulted and the family posted bond after being advised it would not place Shah Alam at risk of deportation, the legal aid statement said.</p><p>As Shah Alam’s release was being processed on February 19, Erie County deputies notified Border Patrol because of the detainer, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said.</p><p>Border Patrol agents arrived as Shah Alam’s release was being processed and took him into their custody.</p><p><strong>What we don’t know:</strong></p><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p>Who posted the bond?</p></li><li><p>Was Shah Alam offered a translator during his release or when Border Patrol agents picked him up?</p></li><li><p>How much communication was there between local and federal authorities before the transfer?</p></li></ul><h3>What happened when he was released from jail?</h3><p>Later that day, immigration authorities determined Shah Alam, as a legal refugee, “was not amenable to removal,” Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.</p><p>Using a translation program, agents attempted to communicate with Shah Alam, according to a federal law enforcement official. Shah Alam was offered the opportunity to make a phone call, but declined, and asked to be taken to the location where he was eventually dropped off, the official said.</p><p>“Border Patrol agents offered him a courtesy ride, which he chose to accept to a coffee shop, determined to be a warm, safe location near his last known address, rather than be released directly from the Border Patrol station. He showed no signs of distress, mobility issues, or disabilities requiring special assistance,” the CBP statement said.</p><p>According to legal aid, Shah Alam was dropped off at a Tim Hortons near his last known address sometime after 8 p.m., though that location had already closed at 7 p.m. His family no longer lived at the prior address, and neither relatives nor his attorney were told he had been released by CBP or where was taken, the organization said.</p><p>“Mr. Alam was extremely vulnerable. He spoke almost no English and could not communicate without the aid of an interpreter. He suffered from severely impaired vision and had other health issues,” the legal aid statement said.</p><p>“He had only been in the US for a few months prior to his arrest. He would not have known where he was or had the wherewithal to contact his family or avail himself of other resources or services that could have assisted him,” the statement continued.</p><p>Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan criticized Shah Alam’s release by Border Patrol, saying agents could have contacted family members or returned him to the county holding center. There, they could have obtained phone numbers for his son or lawyer, who had both been active visitors while he was in custody, according to Ryan.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security pushed back Friday in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2027453843538399655?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">post on X</a> saying, “It is ridiculous to blame Border Patrol for an individual’s death a week after their last interaction with them.”</p><p>The agency emphasized Shah Alam accepted a courtesy ride from federal agents, which “did not have to be provided.”</p><p>One immigration attorney told CNN affiliate <a href=\"https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/local/refugees-death-raises-questions-border-patrol-release/71-88b611e0-664b-4b3b-835a-b39cb7f28e91\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:WGRZ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">WGRZ</a> courtesy rides are not uncommon.
