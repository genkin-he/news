pointing to a continuing trend of strong enthusiasm among the party’s base.</p><p>Through Tuesday, about 850,000 ballots had been cast in the Democratic primary, according to data from the Associated Press. That’s nearly 60% more than the number of votes cast at the same point in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, the last statewide primary in Texas to feature a major competitive Democratic contest.</p><p>It’s also more than the entire advance turnout and over double the number of votes cast on the equivalent day in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial and 2024 Democratic presidential primaries. Many of the more populous counties exceeded their entire primary turnout for those years with several days of early voting and Election Day remaining.</p><p>On the Republican side, advance turnout was about 15% higher than it was at this point in 2022 and slightly trailed turnout one week out from the 2024 primary. It was also slightly ahead of Republican turnout at this point in 2020, when Donald Trump faced only marginal opposition.</p><p>There’s growing evidence of a Democratic advantage in motivation to vote since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Through the last year, Democratic candidates have outperformed 2024 presidential margins in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/tennessee-special-election-democrats-momentum?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:House special elections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">House special elections</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/election-takeaways-new-york-new-jersey-virginia?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:statewide races;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">statewide races</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/18/politics/cnn-poll-democrats-are-deeply-motivated-for-the-midterms-despite-having-dismal-views-of-party-leaders?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Democratic voters have consistently been more likely to describe themselves as extremely motivated to vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Democratic voters have consistently been more likely to describe themselves as extremely motivated to vote</a> in CNN’s polling.</p><h3>Could more votes be cast in Texas’ Democratic primary than the GOP contest?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Voters stand in line to vote early for the primary election, in Dallas, Tuesday, February 17. - LM Otero/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6GwzmgGUwPdVFj_5Mq_KRA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/a1dd685a323c276ef883dd8ce675d8e0><noscript><img alt=\"Voters stand in line to vote early for the primary election, in Dallas, Tuesday, February 17. - LM Otero/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6GwzmgGUwPdVFj_5Mq_KRA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/a1dd685a323c276ef883dd8ce675d8e0 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Voters stand in line to vote early for the primary election, in Dallas, Tuesday, February 17. - LM Otero/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>The surge of voters in the Democratic primary raises the possibility that more Texans will cast ballots in the Democratic primary than the Republican one.</p><p>Democrats in Texas have only matched GOP primary numbers in recent years when they have had competitive presidential elections. Democratic turnout was much higher than Republican turnout in the 2008 presidential primaries, and voters split roughly evenly in casting their ballots in the 2020 primaries.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Each year featured a highly competitive race on the Democratic side but less of one on the Republican side by the time Texas voted, which boosted relative turnout in the Democratic primaries. Both the Democratic and Republican Senate primaries are competitive this year.</p><p>So far, about 54% of votes cast in this year’s primaries have been on the Democratic side. That ratio far outpaces the Democratic pace of casting votes in 2022 or 2024. Early votes tend to tilt slightly more Democratic than Election Day votes do, and in both of those years, the final electorate (including Election Day ballots) was about 2 points less Democratic relative to the early vote at this point.</p><p>If this year’s vote follows the same trend, a narrow majority of Texas primary voters would have cast their ballots in the Democratic over the Republican primary.</p><p>Even if the primary surge in Democratic participation holds through next Tuesday, the pattern may not hold in the much higher turnout general election. Primaries tend to attract the most enthusiastic voters, while the electorate expands in general elections. In 2008, the Democratic presidential primary had double the turnout of the Republican primary – and Democrat Barack Obama went on to lose the state to Republican John McCain by double digits.</p><h3>Democratic turnout is also strong in Arkansas and North Carolina</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OcaNdIHf39Sq8X1_.jNxDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ed3a35729a7487d43b4f81fd84c4c4f0><noscript><img alt=\"Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OcaNdIHf39Sq8X1_.jNxDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ed3a35729a7487d43b4f81fd84c4c4f0 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Voters are also casting votes in Arkansas and North Carolina ahead of Tuesday, and signs point to an increase in Democratic turnout relative to past races.</p><p>Roughly a quarter million votes had been cast in North Carolina’s Democratic Senate primary through Tuesday, up over 50% relative to the equivalent day in 2022. Turnout was up a more modest 8% in the Republican Senate primary, though the GOP race is expected to be less competitive this year than it was in 2022.</p><p>Registered Democrats had cast more ballots than registered Republicans (42% to 28%, with the remaining 30% of voters unaffiliated). This 14-point gap was up from 8 points on the equivalent day in 2022 (41% to 33%). Unaffiliated voters are also more likely to have cast ballots in the Democratic primary: Roughly 55% of unaffiliated voters cast a ballot in the Democratic primary over the Republican primary this year, up from 36% choosing the Democratic ballot in 2022.</p><p>In Arkansas, nearly 40,000 votes had been cast in the Democratic Senate primary through Tuesday (nearly 80% of total advance turnout in 2022, with several days left of early voting to go). Over 80,000 votes had been cast in the Republican primary, just under 50% of the 2022 total advance vote.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

And while fear of violence and retaliation wasn’t the only factor keeping Black people away from political participation in Trump 2.0 – a lack of leadership and cynicism were also major factors – it was a big one.</span></p><p><span>These findings could have major implications for liberal and Democratic groups’ strategies ahead of the midterms. While public surveys indicate many of the Black voters who supported Trump in 2024 have since turned against him, the Democratic Party struggled to turn out Black voters – typically the most loyal part of their base – in both the 2022 midterms and the 2024 presidential election.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When asked to name two reasons why they wouldn’t fight back against government actions harming Black communities, 32% of registered Black voters said they could face arrest for doing so, with a matching number saying they feared it would lead to mob violence against Black people.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kash-patel-olympics-trip-hockey-cultural-activities-private-dinners-report_n_699ef3dfe4b0c4f808275d90?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Kash Patel&#39;s Totally-Not-&#39;Personal&#39; Olympic Trip Was Filled With Personal Activities: Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Kash Patel&#39;s Totally-Not-&#39;Personal&#39; Olympic Trip Was Filled With Personal Activities: Report</a></strong></p><p><span>“It’s scary asserting ourselves as Black folks in this resisting, because we already know about martial law. We already know Trump gives power to the police,” a female focus group participant told the researchers. “We already know that if we go out there with them people, something bad could pop off and then we’re in trouble.”</span></p><p><span>Roughly 25% of respondents said fighting back wouldn’t lead to change, while 18% said it could harm them professionally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Terrence Woodbury, a pollster at HIT Strategies who led the project, said there was fear of political retaliation in both real life and online spaces.</span></p><p><span>“Remember those black squares on Instagram?” Woodbury said. “No one is doing that now because they are afraid expressing these attitudes online makes them a target.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-donald-trump-sotu_n_699ebcc7e4b0967090fda141?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mike Johnson Lays Out The Scenario That Would Sink Donald Trump’s Presidency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mike Johnson Lays Out The Scenario That Would Sink Donald Trump’s Presidency</a></strong></p><p><span>The result has been a resistance movement less connected to Black people, Woodbury said, which has potentially worrying implications for Democratic efforts to turn out marginal voters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“In 2020, the resistance was led by people I would consider those closest to the pain: young people, people of color, lower education, lower income,” Woodbury said, referring to the protest movement after the death of George Floyd during Trump’s first term. “This movement is largely a resistance of privilege for older people, more educated, more higher income. That’s concerning because those are also the most likely voters in America.”</span></p><p><span>The project recommends offering digital safety trainings, pro bono legal assistance and bail funds to help alleviate Black voters’ concerns about protesting the Trump administration. </span></p><p><span>Polling also showed that Black voters felt abandoned by political and community leaders they believe are not doing enough to fight back against Trump.&nbsp;</span><span>While 63% of registered Black voters said congressional Democrats have a major role in fighting government actions that hurt Black communities, only 36% felt the party was “very active” in doing so. Similarly, just 41% thought civil rights groups like the NAACP and ACLU were “very active,” while 56% said they had a major role to play. In addition, voters said Black church leaders weren’t doing enough, with just 31% calling them “very active.”</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-donald-trump-sotu_n_699ec340e4b0967090fda376?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nancy Pelosi Sums Up Donald Trump’s SOTU With Just 1 Word;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nancy Pelosi Sums Up Donald Trump’s SOTU With Just 1 Word</a></strong></p><p><span>The polling also highlighted some generational divides among Black voters. Older black voters were more likely to have been involved in protests, and younger Black voters were less likely to cite battling racism or protecting democracy as a reason to get involved. While 59% of Black voters overall said Trump’s policies had hurt them personally, those numbers were significantly lower for young men: Just 41% said Trump’s policies had hurt them, compared to 42% who said they had no impact.</span></p><p><span>Woodbury, however, was optimistic that the right messaging could persuade Black voters to get more involved – or at least to turn out in November. The key, he said, was to point to specific Trump administration actions that harmed Black voters, remind them of their linked fate, and to point them to past successes to combat cynicism.</span></p><p><span>“I think there’s an opportunity not just to recruit them to do something, but recruit them to join something, to be a part of, to join a movement and be a part of a collective,” Woodbury said.</span></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-news-live-updates_n_699c2475e4b0f41da8d4babb?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks Underway, Patel Fires FBI Agents Who Worked On Classified Documents Case: Live Updates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">U.S.-Iran Nuclear Talks Underway, Patel Fires FBI Agents Who Worked On Classified Documents Case: Live Updates</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/troy-nehls-donald-trump-state-of-the-union_n_699e9e74e4b0dce804ccf3f6?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:MAGA Lawmaker Wins Contest For Most Cringeworthy Moment Of Trump&#39;s SOTU;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">MAGA Lawmaker Wins Contest For Most Cringeworthy Moment Of Trump&#39;s SOTU</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-erratic-with-age-reuters-ipsos-poll_n_699f0798e4b07c22196c484a?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Surprising Number Of Republicans Now Think Trump Is Becoming &#39;Erratic With Age&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Surprising Number Of Republicans Now Think Trump Is Becoming &#39;Erratic With Age&#39;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-voters-fear-retaliation-opposing-trump_n_699fc724e4b0ef1afcc0c32d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

Countries long held as exemplars of higher TFR like France and the Nordic countries are experiencing declines in their birth rates, she said.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=cf639ab0-a04c-5603-878e-39a6086ea120><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:177% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EtUS_q9HrM?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EtUS_q9HrM?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>In the region, the TFRs of Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are also on the downtrend, while in China, the number of deaths exceed births.</p><p>Said Ms Indranee: “The Government is wholly committed to addressing this issue head on and we will spare no effort to arrest and reverse this decline.”</p><p>But this cannot be the work of the Government alone, and all of society needs to play their part, she added.</p><p>She was responding to several MPs like Mr Shawn Loh (Jalan Besar GRC) and NCMP Andre Low who raised concerns and suggestions about the cost of childraising. Some including Mr David Hoe (Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC) asked for more childcare leave and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) called for better fertility health support.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Ms Indranee said the new workgroup will consult members of the public, businesses and the people sector, to develop concrete plans in the coming months.</p><p>It will build on current efforts, while cultivating positive mindsets about marriage and parenthood, work with employers, and engage the whole of society.</p><p>Feedback and suggestions will help shape the work group’s recommendations and guide the next phase of marriage and parenthood enhancements, she said.</p><p>While it is not about pushing a single “correct” path, Ms Indranee noted that two key mindset shifts are needed to create an environment where deeply personal decisions surrounding marriage and parenthood can be viewed positively rather than with fear and anxiety.</p><p>Individuals who were hesitant to have children often looked at parenthood through the lens of what they might lose, like being held back in their careers, the inability to pursue other life goals, and the loss of personal freedom, she said.</p><p>Those with children or intend to have them on the other hand, saw parenthood in terms of what they gained, like joy, fulfilment and personal growth.</p><p>While finding a life partner, getting married and starting a family are major milestones that take time, energy, and change, many Singaporean couples have shown that having a family and careers can co-exist alongside other life goals, Ms Indranee said.</p><p>“Ultimately it is a personal choice. But we need a mindset change, to encourage couples to consider a more balanced picture when exercising this choice.”</p><p>Another prevailing mindset that surfaced during engagements was the immense pressure couples put on themselves to be the “perfect parent”, she noted.</p><p>Ms Indranee said one young doctor felt guilty that he could not spend more time with his son because of his work schedule, and he felt that he was not being a good father.</p><p>Another young newly-wed woman was hesitant to have a child as she was not sure if she could provide the best possible resources for her child to succeed in life.</p><p>“Wanting more time to spend with your children or providing them with the right resources stem from good intentions. However, in hindsight, many parents reflected that parenthood was not about providing the best for their children or having all the answers from the start,” she said.</p><p>Rather, it was about being willing to learn, adapt and grow alongside their children, doing the best they can within their circumstances and relying on community support where possible, she added.</p><p>Many parents feel pressure to help their children excel academically, for fear that they may not succeed in life, she said. This largely stems from the fear that there is only a narrow gate to success.</p><p>These are real anxieties that the Government wants to help address, and the Ministry of Education has made progressive changes over the years to develop multiple pathways for children and reduce over-emphasis on academic results, she added.</p><p>These structural reforms will only work if cultural attitudes towards competition and success shift in tandem, and society must move away from viewing education in Singapore as a competition, but see it as an open highway with many lanes, Ms Indranee said.</p><p>To this end, the MOE will start a series of engagements to look at how to mitigate <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/inside-singapores-education-arms-race-stress-inequality-and-the-push-for-change\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the education “arms race”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the education “arms race”</a>, including by reducing the stakes of examinations.</p><p>The workgroup will also work with employers to foster family-friendly workplace cultures and practices, which make a big difference to parents, said Ms Indranee.</p><p>She cited the example of Mr Edmund Seah, a medical social worker, who took two weeks of paternity leave during his daughter’s first month to support his wife’s confinement. He later took the remaining two weeks and three weeks of shared parental leave during the child’s first year.</p><p>This flexibility allowed the 31-year-old to be present for his wife and baby when it mattered, she said. He paid it forward by covering his colleague’s workload when she went on maternity leave.</p><p>Mr Seah told The Straits Times he was concerned about having enough time for his family given the demands of his job, and had early conversations with his employer, St. Luke’s Hospital, to plan ahead for his leave.</p><p>Having a supportive employer has given him greater peace of mind, he said.</p><p>“I believe that when employees feel supported in important life transitions, they are more committed and willing to contribute meaningfully to their organisations,” he added.</p><p>Said Ms Indranee: “The latest TFR figures have not deterred us from our quest to boost marriage and parenthood. If anything, it underscores the urgency of the task before us, and it has made us even more determined to turn things around.”</p><p>The Government will redouble our efforts to address this existential challenge.”</p><p>Addressing Ms Hany Soh’s (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) clarification on the timeline of the work group’s engagements and recommendations, Ms Indranee said some measures could be implemented earlier while more complex policies could take longer.</p><p>“Time is of the essence. It’s an existential issue. We can’t afford to sit back and wait,” she said.</p><p>“In this term of Government, you can be assured that we will be preoccupied with trying to make sure that we have more Singaporean babies born.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-needs-to-reset-views-on-marriage-parenthood-new-work-group-to-study-issues-indranee?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

they’re increasingly concerned about his mental capacity as well.</p><p>The unease is not at the levels it was with Biden, who was 81 when he dropped out of the race, but it’s growing as an issue for the 79-year-old Trump.</p><p>In fact, multiple recent polls show a majority of Americans questioning it in one way or another. And even many Republicans seem to have concerns.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking poll came Tuesday, ahead of Trump’s first <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/what-to-watch-sotu-time?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:State of the Union address;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">State of the Union address</a> of his second term, which beat his own record for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/speech-time-length-trump-sotu-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the longest speech to Congress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the longest speech to Congress</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/most-americans-say-trump-is-growing-erratic-with-age-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Reuters-Ipsos poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Reuters-Ipsos poll</a> showed 61% of Americans agreed that Trump has “become erratic with age.” Even 30% of Republicans agreed with that sentiment.</p><p>The survey harks back to some surveys in Trump’s first term, when many Americans grew to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:question his mental acuity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">question his mental acuity</a>. But while the percentage of registered voters saying he wasn’t “mentally stable” approached 50% in Quinnipiac University polling following the attack on the US Capitol in 2021, it never crested a majority — much less hitting 61%. (“Erratic” is, of course, not the same as “unstable.” But they are along the same lines.)</p><p>The Reuters-Ipsos poll also showed a decrease in the percentage of Americans who say Trump is “mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” That number has dropped from <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-09/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Large%20Sample%20Poll%20%235%20Topline%2009%2020%202023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:54% in September 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">54% in September 2023</a> to 45% today.</p><p>But Trump — who often boasts about acing cognitive tests and who spoke for an hour and 47 minutes on Tuesday night — is still nowhere close to where Biden was; only around one-quarter of Americans said Biden was mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges in <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/only-michelle-obama-bests-trump-alternative-biden-2024\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:July 2024;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">July 2024</a>, the month he dropped out of the race.</p><p>Other polls echo these findings, including one from CNN last month.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>That survey showed the percentage saying Trump has the “stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president” <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26490187/cnn-poll-on-trump-at-one-year.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:declining from 53% in late 2023 to 46% today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">declining from 53% in late 2023 to 46% today</a>.</p><p>That 46% is still well clear of where Biden was in 2023 (between 25% and 32%).</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2026-02/2026-02-22%20ABC-Post-Ipsos%20Topline.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll</a> last week showed majorities said Trump didn’t have the mental sharpness (56%) or physical health (51%) it takes to serve effectively.</p><p>The former is up 13 points from May 2023, while the latter is up even more – by 23 points.</p><p>Those numbers aren’t where Biden was late in his presidency, when he was in the 60s on both measures. But the percentage who doubts Trump’s mental sharpness (56%) is actually similar to where Biden was at this point in his term.

The percentage of them who are “very confident” in Trump’s mental fitness has dropped from 75% to 66%. On physical fitness, he’s dropped from 65% to 55%.</p><p>So in both the Reuters and Pew polls, we’re seeing 3 in 10 people (or more) in Trump’s own base express some concern about this issue.</p><p>Again, Biden had worse numbers overall. By <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/24/voters-views-of-biden-and-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:April 2024;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">April 2024</a>, the percentage of voters saying they were “very confident” was only 21% for mental fitness and 15% for physical fitness. <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24131320/cnn-poll-on-2024.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN polling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN polling</a> showed as much as half of his base said Biden didn’t have the requisite stamina and sharpness.</p><p>But why might Trump’s numbers on these measures be worsening?</p><p>One explanation is that they’re simply falling alongside his popularity. As people sour on Trump overall, perhaps they’re more likely to view his often-strange public performances in a more negative light.</p><p>But we’re also seeing these concerns register even with some Americans who are more inclined to view Trump favorably. It’s certainly possible that his verbal stumbles — things like repeatedly mixing up Iceland and Greenland — are registering. It’s also possible that scrutiny of bruises on Trump’s hands and whether he’s fallen asleep during public events — as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/politics/health-trump-bruises-left-hand?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:White House’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">White House’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/03/politics/trump-health-disclosures-questions?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:slow disclosures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">slow disclosures</a> about his medical testing and his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:more limited;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">more limited</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/29/politics/public-schedule-trump-health-stamina?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:public schedule;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">public schedule</a> — are leading some people to raise more questions than they otherwise might.</p><p>Regardless, what’s clear is that the oldest president ever elected is now having to deal with this issue, just like the previous holder of that title did a few years ago.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

At the same time, Berlin regards the Communist Party-run state as a systemic rival to the West.</p><p>The German leader was accompanied in China by a large delegation of business leaders, including executives of auto giants Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes.</p><p>Merz visited a Mercedes plant in Beijing on Thursday morning, where he was shown a demonstration of self-driving vehicles.</p><p>He then travelled to Hangzhou, where he visited the sites of Germany&#39;s Siemens Energy and Chinese humanoid robot-maker Unitree.</p><p>The eastern city is home to several other major Chinese tech companies like AI unicorn DeepSeek and e-commerce giant Alibaba.</p><p>European business leaders, who broadly complain China is flooding the EU market with cheap goods, have urged Merz&nbsp;to keep a cavernous trade imbalance at the top of his agenda.</p><p>Germany&#39;s trade deficit with China hit a record 89 billion euros ($105 billion) last year.</p><p>&quot;We have good cooperation in China.

build-up in the Middle East in decades.</p><p>The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal.</p><p>The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador&#39;s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.</p><p>Oman&#39;s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi later confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides had expressed &quot;unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions&quot;.</p><p>Iran&#39;s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not &quot;at all&quot; seeking a nuclear weapon.</p><p>&quot;Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,&quot; President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><p>United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman said.</p><p>While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants

Ford, the world&#39;s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete Thursday, an AFP photographer said.</p><p>The developments follow a massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed after the movement called for the end of the Islamic republic.</p><p>- &#39;Sinister nuclear ambitions&#39; -</p><p>In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of &quot;pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions&quot;, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump also claimed Tehran had &quot;already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they&#39;re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America&quot;.</p><p>The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims &quot;big lies&quot;.</p><p>The maximum range of Iran&#39;s missiles is 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.</p><p>However the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 kilometres -- less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.</p><p>Trump&#39;s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>Ahead of Thursday&#39;s talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran&#39;s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons &quot;a big, big problem&quot;.</p><p>He followed up by saying &quot;the president wants diplomatic solutions&quot;.</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump&#39;s threats &quot;seriously&quot;, saying the US president had a &quot;right&quot; to use military action.</p><p>&quot;You can&#39;t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,&quot; Vance told &quot;America&#39;s Newsroom&quot; on Fox News.</p><p>- &#39;People would suffer&#39; -</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them &quot;a historic opportunity&quot;, adding that a deal was &quot;within reach&quot;.</p><p>The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump&#39;s daughter Ivanka.</p><p>The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.</p><p>A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.</p><p>Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.</p><p>Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.</p><p>&quot;There would be famine and people would suffer a lot.

TCS announced 12,000 ‌job cuts last year, but has since denied ​to local media that the layoffs were AI-related.</p><p>Cognizant, ​which generates about 30% of its ​code through AI and aims to reach 50%, is not worried ‌about automation eliminating entry-level jobs. CEO ​Ravi Kumar S said ​during the company&#39;s earnings call earlier this month that it hired 25,000 fresh graduates in 2025, and expects to exceed that in 2026.</p><p>Almost all of Cognizant&#39;s ​clients have already tried ‌to work with AI agents, Hodjat said, but have acknowledged that they ​need us to deploy it within their systems for returns.</p><p>(Reporting by Haripriya ​Suresh in Mumbai; Editing by Janane Venkatraman)</p></div></article></div>",
