class=caas-body><p>TAOS, New Mexico, Nov 1 (Reuters)&nbsp;-&nbsp;New Mexico became on Saturday the first U.S. state to offer free child care to all residents in a bid to boost its economy and lift education and child welfare levels ranked the worst in the country.</p><p>Under the program, families, regardless of income, can receive state vouchers to cover public and private child care fees. It culminates efforts New Mexico has made to expand access to free child care since the governor and state legislature created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019.</p><p><strong>News: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pantless-cop-matthew-jackson-detroit_n_690290e5e4b057baa82d76c4?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cop Gets Caught With His Pants Down During Hearing — Literally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Cop Gets Caught With His Pants Down During Hearing — Literally</a></strong></p><p>The launch comes as other Democratic-run states, cities and counties eye a step popular among working families.

She and her husband Shawn O’Kelly, a truck driver, earn a fraction above New Mexico’s previous income cap for free child care, which was about $129,000 per year for their family of four.</p><p>“We’ll be able to go on vacation, we won’t have to decide what bills we’re going to pay, like, are we going to do propane or the mortgage?” O’Brien said.</p><p>To achieve a fully universal system, New Mexico must create nearly 14,000 more child care slots and recruit 5,000 educators, according to its Democratic-run government. The state is establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct and expand child care facilities. It is also increasing reimbursement rates to providers that pay entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour, above the state’s $12 hourly minimum wage, and offer full-time care.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>News: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gayle-king-expected-to-leave-cbs-mornings_n_6903e400e4b00c26f070daf9?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gayle King Expected To Leave &#39;CBS Mornings&#39; Amid Network&#39;s Regime Change: Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gayle King Expected To Leave &#39;CBS Mornings&#39; Amid Network&#39;s Regime Change: Report</a></strong></p><p>Alison McPartlon, director of the University of New Mexico-Taos Kids’ Campus child care center, said her waiting list is so long some children do not get in before they start kindergarten.

class=caas-body><p>For months, Democrats, paralyzed by good-government reforms and self-interest, struggled to counteract a push led by President Donald Trump for red states to redraw their congressional lines and add more Republican seats in a desperate attempt to head off Democratic control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections.</p><p>In the past week, however, the Democratic counteroffensive has begun in earnest. A California referendum to add Democratic seats looks certain to pass. Virginia Democrats called a surprise legislative session to start their own redrawing process. And national leaders are increasingly bullish about redrawing lines in both Maryland and Illinois despite ongoing resistance from state legislative leaders.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clay-higgins-snap-cuts-post-stop-smoking-crack_n_6904e1f9e4b0b48d8a1c4841?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Rep.

Slams SNAP Recipients For &#39;Smoking Crack&#39; In Unhinged Post About Cuts</a></strong></p><p>The first step is in California, where Republicans have openly given up on stopping Proposition 50, which would change the state’s constitution and set up the state legislature to eliminate five GOP-held seats in the state, counteracting Texas’ mid-decade redistricting that eliminated five Democratic-held seats.</p><p>Democrats are hopeful California’s success will create momentum, both by showing other states that changing congressional lines to combat Trump is politically popular and by forcing the ambitious governors of other blue states to keep up with the successes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p><p>“If you’re a blue state and you have a trifecta between the legislature and the governor and you have the opportunity to get another seat or two, it would seem to me you would be emboldened to do so if California is doing what it’s doing,” said Rusty Hicks, the chair of the California Democratic Party.</p><p>State and national Democrats have cast Proposition 50 as a necessary response to Trump’s efforts to consolidate his autocratic rule. In the final days, advertising in support of the proposition has featured state and national Democrats including Newsom, former President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-nobel-physics_n_69041bb7e4b00c26f070fa48?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Pathetic&#39;: Critics Clown Trump After His &#39;Absolutely Embarrassing&#39; New Nobel Boast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">&#39;Pathetic&#39;: Critics Clown Trump After His &#39;Absolutely Embarrassing&#39; New Nobel Boast</a></strong></p><p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said he hoped the proposition’s passage would have a “chilling effect” on GOP redistricting efforts, noting Republicans are already facing resistance to their efforts in Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.</p><p>In an interview with HuffPost, Martin stopped short of directly calling on Illinois, Maryland or other blue states to pass new maps but his intent was clear.</p><p>“This is a showdown Republicans wanted, and we’re going to give them a showdown,” Martin said. “This is not the Democratic Party of yesteryear, where we can roll over and let them get away with this.

Greg Abbott and state legislators there to redraw Texas’ maps, and continued by pressuring Missouri and North Carolina to follow suit, eliminating one Democratic-held seat each. GOP-run state legislatures in Florida, Indiana and Kansas have all made moves to redraw their congressional maps. In Ohio, redistricting commission members reached a compromise that made two Democratic-held seats slightly more red. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could open the door for Southern states to eliminate up to 19 Democratic-held seats if it guts the Voting Rights Act in the case of Louisiana v. Callais.</p><p>Democrats’ efforts to counteract these moves have been logistically complicated — many of the states where they hold full control over state government have adopted nonpartisan redistricting legislation or constitutional amendments over the past two decades.</p><p>“State legislative Democrats need to keep all their options open including using legislative power to pursue mid-cycle changes to these maps,” said Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “This is not a fight that we wanted, but this is not something that can go unresponded to.”</p><p>The clearest sign of post-California momentum is in Virginia, where Democrats <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-democrats-advance-plan-counter-trump-spawned-redistricting-red-states-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:began the process to put a constitutional amendment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">began the process to put a constitutional amendment</a> before voters in 2026 that would allow the legislature to circumvent the state’s nonpartisan districting commission to redraw maps.

Rodney Willett, a Democrat and chief sponsor of the constitutional amendment legislation, said during floor debates on Thursday.</p><p>Other efforts to respond to Trump’s redistricting campaign are facing more intraparty resistance, even if national leaders are growing confident they can overcome local objections. Maryland already gerrymandered its district map in 2022 to limit Republicans to just one district out of eight. Gov. Wes Moore and state House Speaker Adrienne Jones, both Democrats, wanted the legislature to call a special session to redraw district lines to eliminate that one GOP district, but Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, rejected this idea <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-2db8-d346-affb-2fbfb2170000\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a letter to colleagues on Tuesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">in a letter to colleagues on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>Ferguson, however, is battling with most of the other leading Democrats in the state. U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost he was “disappointed” in Ferguson’s letter. “Maryland has a responsibility to respond to the Republicans’ outrageous actions in Texas,” he said. “We should not unilaterally disarm and we should maximize our opportunities.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A sign reads \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GmhKZcUA3hxQLiUizLjJ4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/6c5de7f9e834ae1dbef0100fc19c4926><noscript><img alt=\"A sign reads \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GmhKZcUA3hxQLiUizLjJ4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/6c5de7f9e834ae1dbef0100fc19c4926 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A sign reads \"Yes on Prop 50\" during early in-person voting for the California Proposition 50 special election in Los Angeles. <span class=\"copyright\">PATRICK T.

Even if no special session is called, Democrats are hopeful the state legislature could move early next year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ferguson’s arguments against new lines are not without merit: Maryland’s existing map was adopted after a state court rejected the legislature’s 2021 map as an illegal partisan gerrymander. The current map, adopted as a compromise after that decision, has never been challenged and could be upended in the likely event that an even more partisan map were adopted. While highly unlikely, Ferguson fears a legal challenge to any new map could not only undo any effort to gain a seat, but also lead Democrats to lose a seat in the state.</span></p><p>“We do not know how a court would assess a revised midcycle map and whether the court would use party affiliation as a measure,” Ferguson wrote in his letter. “We do, however, have certainty under the current map; that evaporates the moment we start down the path of redistricting mid-cycle with an unclear legal landscape and an even more unclear legal timeline.”</p><p><span>Like Maryland, Illinois’ congressional district map is already heavily tilted to Democrats where only 3 out of 17 districts lean toward Republicans. U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries met with Illinois state legislators on Monday to urge them to redraw districts to eliminate one GOP-held seat. But such an effort would require redrawing up to four Chicago-area districts currently held by Black lawmakers. While those four members joined Jeffries at the meeting and at his presser afterward, that idea is not popular with Black political leaders in the Illinois Legislature.</span></p><p><span>“If a map is produced that dilutes Black votes, the Black Legislative Caucus have articulated that that is something that they’re not going to be able to support,” state Sen. Willie Preston, a Democrat who represents the South Side of Chicago and nearby suburbs, told reporters on Monday.</span></p><p><span>New York cannot redraw districts without the legislature passing a constitutional amendment to circumvent its nonpartisan redistricting commission. That process can’t be completed until after the 2026 election.

And so, on a Tuesday afternoon in July, he sent a secret message to a judge, asking for some help. “I have an active investigation issue that I wish to address with you,” Gentner Drummond, the state’s attorney general, began his email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The recipient was Gary Lumpkin, the top judge on Oklahoma’s Criminal Court of Appeals. The subject line misspelled the name of the man on death row, Tremane Wood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-the-view_n_69047b34e4b0d05408abd167?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest</a></strong></p><p><span>It was a tricky case for Drummond, who had cultivated a reputation as a fair arbiter of capital punishment. The death penalty is supposedly reserved for the “worst-of-the-worst” kind of criminals, but Tremane was never a particularly compelling example. In 2002, Tremane, his older brother and two women were charged with first-degree murder for killing Ronnie Wipf during a botched robbery. Wipf died from a single stab wound, but under the state’s so-called felony murder statute, prosecutors didn’t have to prove who killed him in order to secure murder convictions — only that they each participated in the robbery that led to the death.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tremane denied stabbing Wipf. He was represented at trial by a lawyer struggling with drug addiction who billed almost no work on the case, and Tremane was sentenced to death. His older brother, who testified that he had killed Wipf, had robust legal representation and received a life sentence. The outcome seemed perverse on its face: The person who admitted to the murder received a more lenient sentence than his little brother, who swore he had never killed anyone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even some of the people who helped convict Tremane came to feel that something had gone wrong. The jury foreperson, the only Black member of the jury, has </span><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/death-row-felony-murder-oklahoma_n_67094c44e4b0f3da6456d60c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>said</span></a><span> she felt pressured into voting for death and would have held out for life if she had had more information about the case.

At that hearing, Tremane and his lawyers would have the chance to make the case for mercy and ask the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to recommend that the governor spare his life.

Tremane just loved his brother. And Jake loved Tremane. And there was nothing that could break that. Nothing.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Following Jake’s lead, Tremane joined a gang and fell into the juvenile detention system as a young teen. In late 2001, Jake returned home after spending seven years in prison. By then, Tremane, 22, had two kids and a job at a pizza restaurant in Oklahoma City. He was focused on staying out of trouble.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-adelita-grijavla_n_69052e61e4b0060501ac5325?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay</a></strong></p><p><span>On New Year’s Eve, Tremane was at a house party with his cousins when Jake showed up and told Tremane to come with him. Eager to spend time with his brother after years apart, Tremane agreed. They went to a brewery with Jake’s girlfriend, Lanita Bateman, and Tremane’s ex-girlfriend, Brandy Warden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There, the women were approached by two out-of-towners named Ronnie Wipf and Arnold Kleinsasser, who were passing through Oklahoma on their way back to work on a harvest crew. Ronnie suggested the four of them go back to a motel room. Brandy and Lanita didn’t want to go, they would later say, but felt pressure from Jake and Tremane to get money from the unsuspecting men.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At the motel room, the group negotiated a price of $210 in exchange for sex. Lanita discreetly gave Jake the motel room number, hoping she and Brandy could escape without having sex and get picked up by the brothers. But before they got that far, two masked men in long trench coats and leather gloves knocked on the door. When Ronnie opened the door, the men burst into the room, and the girls ran out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A struggle ensued. Arnold managed to escape, but Ronnie was fatally stabbed. Within days, Tremane, Jake, Brandy and Lanita were all arrested and charged with first-degree felony-murder, robbery with firearms, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors sought lengthy prison sentences for the women and death sentences for both brothers.</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-mace-cops-airport_n_690546efe4b0b48d8a1c8c13?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nancy Mace Berated &#39;F***ing Incompetent&#39; Cops During Airport Meltdown, Police Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nancy Mace Berated &#39;F***ing Incompetent&#39; Cops During Airport Meltdown, Police Say</a></strong></p><p><span>The young women faced an impossible decision: help send people they cared for deeply to death row or risk spending the rest of their lives in prison. Lanita, 19, who had only been dating Jake for two months, declined to cooperate with the state and was sentenced to life in prison, plus 101 years. Brandy, 20, who had known Tremane since they were kids, agreed to testify for the state in exchange for a reduced sentence. She had three young children, including a son with Tremane, to get home to.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Conflict-of-interest restrictions prevented the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System from representing both Wood brothers, so the court assigned Tremane’s case to private attorney Johnny Albert. Once a respected criminal defense attorney, Albert struggled with drug addiction by the time he took on Tremane’s case and would later temporarily lose his law license due to allegations of client neglect. He billed just two hours of work on the case outside of court and never visited his client in jail.

He testified that he stabbed Ronnie and that Tremane wasn’t with him on the night of the robbery. He didn’t want his brother to die for something he didn’t do, he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Parts of Jake’s testimony lacked credibility. Brandy had already placed Tremane at the motel robbery. But there’s evidence that Jake was telling the truth that he — not Tremane — killed Ronnie. Before Lanita was sentenced, a parole officer prepared a report documenting her recollection of the crime. In the report, she describes hearing Jake say that “he thought he killed a guy” after they got home from the motel. This report was available at the time of Tremane’s trial, but Albert never presented it to jurors. Had Albert asked, Lanita would have been willing to testify in support of Tremane, she wrote in a 2011 declaration.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Lanita doesn’t regret not testifying for the state, even though she may spend the rest of her life in prison. “I can be free no matter where my body is. They can’t lock up my spirit,” she said in a recent interview. “I would not help kill someone.” Tremane’s looming execution has made her feel “helpless,” she said. “I’m devastated. I’m dying inside.”</p><p>“Trying to save somebody and you can’t do anything but sit and wait and hope that people make the right decisions — it’s painful,” Lanita said.</p><p><span>Although the state didn’t have to prove Tremane killed Ronnie in order for jurors to convict, prosecutors portrayed him as an unrepentant killer while making the case that he deserved the ultimate punishment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This person stuck a big knife into the chest of a 19-year-old man. Stuck it in there five inches. And never said to one person, ‘I’m sorry about that,’” Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney Fern Smith said.</span></p><p><span>“What kind of person is that? Somebody different from you and me. And that fact … is the reason why he deserves the death penalty,” Smith said. “How can you kill, intentionally, knowingly kill another human being and not be sorry about it?”</span></p><p><span>Tremane was convicted and sentenced to death.</span></p><p><span>In Jake’s trial the following year, prosecutors flipped their theory of the crime and portrayed Jake as the killer. They introduced his testimony from Tremane’s trial and letters allegedly written by Jake to Brandy and Smith, the prosecutor, bragging about the killing and threatening more violence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“You have evidence from the defendant’s mouth that … that he did in fact murder Ronnie Wipf,” Smith said. “You also have some letters where he, himself, said he murdered Ronnie Wipf. Not only did he murder Ronnie Wipf, he liked it. He enjoyed it.”</span></p><p><span>Initially, Jake wanted to join his brother on death row. But his attorneys worked hard to win his trust and convince him to participate in a vigorous defense. Jurors found Jake guilty of felony murder — but this time, they voted to let him live. Jake was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 630px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:100%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"From left: Zjaiton \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T3XBVGTUSmQpEmnlzV1XpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjQy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/f35d6fd8da1028fa7cc13718bbd36624><noscript><img alt=\"From left: Zjaiton \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/T3XBVGTUSmQpEmnlzV1XpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjQy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/f35d6fd8da1028fa7cc13718bbd36624 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>From left: Zjaiton \"Jake,\" Andre and Tremane Wood as children. <span class=\"copyright\">Tremane Wood's family</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Two years after Tremane’s trial, Albert was arrested after repeatedly failing to show up in court for another case. The lawyer admitted he was struggling with substance abuse and was released on bond to begin drug and alcohol treatment. The Oklahoma Bar Association charged him with 11 counts of professional misconduct based on complaints of neglect from his former clients. Albert admitted to the allegations, and his law license was suspended for 14 months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Two of Albert’s former clients in separate cases have had their death sentences thrown out on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Before he died in 2018, Albert admitted in two separate sworn statements to doing a poor job on Tremane’s case. He also wrote Tremane an apology note, stating, “I’m sorry for everything in the past. You got me at a bad time and its not your fault.” (He, too, misspelled Tremane’s name.) But Tremane’s requests for a new trial had repeatedly been denied by appellate courts, largely for procedural technicalities. </span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 355px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An apology note to Tremane written by his attorney Johnny Albert.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Dz5qY84qjDWBu6BG9hP.5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/316aed703d25df7848ab01a5430f931a><noscript><img alt=\"An apology note to Tremane written by his attorney Johnny Albert.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Dz5qY84qjDWBu6BG9hP.5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/316aed703d25df7848ab01a5430f931a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An apology note to Tremane written by his attorney Johnny Albert. <span class=\"copyright\">HuffPost</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>The trial judge in Tremane’s case rejected his bid for a new trial, finding that Albert’s actions were part of the trial strategy. Even after Albert said that wasn’t the case, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals denied Tremane’s petition for post-conviction relief, finding that Albert’s “client neglect, abuse of drugs and alcohol and emotional instability” appeared to have started after Tremane’s trial had ended.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Years later, multiple people who were part of a gang called the Playboy Gangsta Crips provided Tremane’s legal team with sworn affidavits detailing how Albert represented members of the gang in exchange for drugs. The former clients described seeing Albert drink and do drugs regularly before and throughout the period of time he represented Tremane.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But that still wasn’t enough for the court. Presented with this evidence, the OCCA again denied Tremane’s petition, stating it was “identical” to his previous claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that he should have presented this evidence when he first filed for relief.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not asking to go home,” Tremane said in an interview last year. “I just want a fair trial with a competent lawyer.”</span></p><p><span>In 2019, shortly after Tremane became eligible for execution, Jake died by suicide in his cell. Tremane could never make sense of how his brother, the strongest person he knew, could kill himself. Some members of his family still doubt the cause of his death. But spending months in solitary confinement himself, Tremane understands how his brother lost the will to live, he said when I visited him in August. “I see what the isolation does to your mind.”</span></p><p><span>The day before the visit, Tremane’s mom told me that he has a strong mindset — but that he was tired. He kept fighting to live, he told her, because he worried about what would happen to her if he died.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Linda Wood poses for a portrait at her home in Oklahoma City in August 2024.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tqy9.bi0SN2U6oNnzCLc4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/d98742072275f158782f385861dcd874><noscript><img alt=\"Linda Wood poses for a portrait at her home in Oklahoma City in August 2024.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tqy9.bi0SN2U6oNnzCLc4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/d98742072275f158782f385861dcd874 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Linda Wood poses for a portrait at her home in Oklahoma City in August 2024. <span class=\"copyright\">Nick Oxford for HuffPost</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>“I’ve tried to play that scenario in my head a million times, and I can’t,” Linda said in an interview. “When I think about him dying, I can’t breathe. I still grieve my son Jake every day because losing your child is not something you ever get over. I wouldn’t wish it on the person I hate most in the world. But to lose two sons, I don’t know. I don’t know how people go on,” she said through tears.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I can’t tell him, ‘Son, if you die, don’t worry, I’ll be alright.’ Because I won’t. I won’t ever be alright,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Linda has never met Ronnie’s mother, Barbara Wipf, but she suspects Barbara never recovered from losing her son. “My heart aches for her. And I know there’s nothing I could ever say or ever do that could bring her any peace.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After Ronnie’s death, Barbara fell into a deep depression, she said. It never went away, but with the help of medication, she found a way to cope. “Sometimes all you can do is get it out of the system,” Barbara said in an interview, the lingering pain still audible in her soft voice. “You cry and cry and cry. And then, you feel a little better.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Years after Ronnie’s death, Barbara’s daughter, her only other child, died unexpectedly. “I guess God doesn’t give you too much to bear. He helps you carry everything. We have to believe that there is a God,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When Barbara sees Ronnie’s friends getting married and having kids, she thinks about what a good dad he would’ve been. She asked me questions about Tremane and his family. If she resented that Tremane got to have children and grandchildren, and her son didn’t, she didn’t say so. If anything, she sounded sad that Tremane didn’t get to be with them. She told me I could tell Linda that she lost two children, too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tremane wrote Barbara and her husband a letter last year apologizing for his role in their son’s death. “He wrote me how sorry he is, which I believe, because my religion tells me he wrote the truth,” Barbara said, referring to her Hutterite faith. “I think he should feel sorry.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But she and her husband don’t believe in the death penalty, and she doesn’t want Tremane to die. “They should let him live,” she said. “I don’t think they should execute him.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This will not bring [Ronnie] back,” Barbara continued. “It’s sad, and it will stay sad.”</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>This will not bring him back ...

When Tremane heard the news, he had a panic attack.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m used to getting bad news and I know how to deal with that,” he said in the August interview. “I didn’t know what to do with the good news. It’s scary to get your hopes up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Throughout the trial, prosecutors repeatedly told jurors that Brandy, their star witness, would serve 45 years in prison. The idea that she would be imprisoned into her 60s likely boosted her credibility with jurors because it suggested she wasn’t gaining much by cooperating with the state. “We always felt like we could argue that to the jury. Well, she’s getting life, too, you know?” former Oklahoma County Assistant District Attorney George Burnett said in a procedural interview with the Office of the Attorney General ahead of the evidentiary hearing.</span></p><p><span>In fact, Brandy’s sentence was later modified to 35 years, in exchange for her testifying against her co-defendants — and with “good time” credit, she was released after 12 years. That release date was only possible, Tremane’s lawyers said, because of crucial terms of her deal that were not disclosed to jurors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The hearing, which took place over several days in April, yielded explosive revelations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At first, Burnett testified that the prosecution’s plea agreement with Brandy represented the full extent of their deal. Federal public defender Amanda Bass Castro Alves, one of Tremane’s current lawyers, confronted Burnett with evidence that his plea agreement with another witness for the prosecution did not reflect the fact that the prosecutors had dismissed and downgraded the witness’ pending felonies after Tremane was sentenced to death.</span></p><p><span>Burnett then testified that the full scope of the state’s agreement with Brandy was actually documented in a “memorandum,” not in the plea agreement. After learning that neither lawyers for Tremane nor the state had seen the memorandum, the judge obtained a copy from Brandy’s case file at the Oklahoma County Public Defender’s office. It clearly showed, contrary to prosecutors’ claims at Tremane’s trial, that Brandy would receive a sentence of 35 years in exchange for testifying against her co-defendants.</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 354px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Brandy Warden&#39;s plea agreement showing her deal carried a 35-year sentence, contrary to what prosecutors told jurors at trial.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fDsHlEg76st55Qi5UtM_aA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/d3cb0b2dfacfa1a23fd4def897f60206><noscript><img alt=\"Brandy Warden&#39;s plea agreement showing her deal carried a 35-year sentence, contrary to what prosecutors told jurors at trial.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fDsHlEg76st55Qi5UtM_aA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/d3cb0b2dfacfa1a23fd4def897f60206 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Brandy Warden's plea agreement showing her deal carried a 35-year sentence, contrary to what prosecutors told jurors at trial. <span class=\"copyright\">Oklahoma County District Court</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Asked why Burnett repeatedly told jurors that Brandy would spend 45 years in prison, he testified he “made a mistake, probably.”&nbsp;</span><strong><br></strong></p><p><span>“Never underestimate my — my ability to say something stupid to a jury,” Burnett said.&nbsp;</span><strong><br></strong></p><p><span>At the time of Tremane’s trial, Brandy was already serving a deferred felony sentence for an unrelated crime that could be dismissed if she successfully completed probation.

She believed she was agreeing to a deal of 45 years, with the opportunity for review one year after she was sentenced.

It’s the proposed Findings from the AG’s office,” admitted the judge, who was supposed to be an impartial arbiter between Tremane and the state. “They did do an outstanding job.”</p><p><span>When Tremane arrived at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 2004, death row prisoners were held on H-unit, a constellation of windowless cement cells. They spent 22 to 24 hours per day in their cells and were only allowed “no-contact visits,” separated from their loved ones by a thick layer of plexiglass. Being imprisoned on H-unit was like being “buried alive,” one prisoner told the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Under the threat of litigation from the ACLU-OK, the corrections department agreed to move death row prisoners to A-unit in 2019, which came with small quality-of-life improvements. Most importantly to Tremane, they were allowed weekly contact visits. For the first time since his arrest, Tremane was able to hug his mom. When his first granddaughter was born, he was able to cradle her in his arms, a moment he never thought he’d live to experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But by the summer, even those brief, joyful moments would be snatched away from Tremane.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Around the time that Drummond requested the Sept. 11 execution date, prison officials found contraband phones in Tremane’s cell.</span></p><p><span>Contraband cell phones are a felony, but they are also ubiquitous in nearly every U.S. prison — often because guards sneak them in and sell them to people desperate for a tie to the outside world. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections </span><a href=\"https://oklahomawatch.org/2025/10/02/oklahoma-prisons-one-step-closer-to-blocking-contraband-cell-phone-signals/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>said</span></a><span> last month that it had seized more than 4,000 contraband phones in 2025 — roughly one for every seven people in its custody. Because contraband phones are so common, guards often look the other way or hand down light punishments when they see one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Contraband phones are an issue that is being “aggressively addressed at our facilities by the agency’s investment in new contraband detection practices and technology, and nationally by the federal government through legal authorization for jamming/signal interference,” Kay Thompson, public relations chief for Oklahoma’s Department of Corrections, said in an email. Punishment includes mandatory revocation of credits toward early release and mandatory level demotion, which impacts a prisoner’s pay and access to privileges like phones, televisions and recreation. There is also the optional punishment of disciplinary segregation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But for Tremane, getting caught with cell phones proved devastating.</span></p><p><span>As punishment, he was moved back to H-unit, where he is allowed a single, one-hour no-contact visit per week and has limited access to a phone. These restrictions are in place longer than he is expected to live — meaning he may never get the opportunity to embrace his mom, his brother, his girlfriend, his sons, his nieces and nephews, or his grandkids again. </span></p><p><span>When social worker Jorja Leap visited Tremane on July 2 in preparation for his clemency hearing, she was alarmed by his apparent deterioration since their last visit in November. During their prior visit, Tremane acknowledged he might be facing imminent execution, “but he was hopeful and positive about whatever amount of time he might be alive,” Leap wrote in a report. But in July, he “was in despair and cried throughout the three hours we spent together.” He told her he had acquired enough pills to overdose and that he had tried to make a noose to hang himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While Tremane was contemplating ways to end his own life, Drummond was at work trying to ensure the state would get the chance to kill him. With Tremane’s clemency hearing coming up, the contraband cell phones presented the perfect opportunity to make the case that he wasn’t a rehabilitated family man — but an unrepentant rule-breaker, undeserving of mercy.</span></p><p><span>On July 15, Drummond emailed Lumpkin, the judge overseeing Tremane’s case, to secretly notify him about the contraband cell phones. He suggested, without evidence, that Tremane had used the phones to sell drugs, order a “hit” on another prisoner and communicate with his public defender and a county judge’s clerk. (In a subsequent email, Drummond clarified that the public defender Tremane had contacted was not part of his current legal team. The lawyer, who represented Tremane years ago, has since resigned from the public defender’s office.)&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Drummond had taken the unusual step of referring the phone incident to state law enforcement officials, and he wanted the judge to quietly postpone Tremane’s execution to give the state more time to build its case before his clemency hearing.</span></p><p><span>At first, Lumpkin appeared willing to oblige. He and the other judges on the OCCA planned to meet the following week to discuss execution dates, the judge told the attorney general. “Is that timing OK or is this something that will need attention prior to that time? Please let me know,” Lumpkin emailed Drummond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Drummond responded that the timing worked for him and thanked the judge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The American Bar Association advises both </span><a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_code_of_judicial_conduct/model_code_of_judicial_conduct_canon_2/rule2_9expartecommunications/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:judges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>judges</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_5_impartiality_decorum_of_the_tribunal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:lawyers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>lawyers</span></a><span> against “ex parte communications,” or communication between a decisionmaker and an interested party without the other parties’ knowledge.

In other words, he didn’t want Tremane to have the chance to prepare a defense related to the cell phone allegations. “We would rather have a September 11 execution date than compromise the investigation through providing Mr. Wood notice of the investigation,” Drummond wrote.</span></p><p><span>Oklahoma’s Code of Judicial Conduct </span><a href=\"https://oklahoma.gov/cojc/resources-information/code-of-judicial-conduct.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:requires;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>requires</span></a><span> a judge who inadvertently receives an ex parte communication to “promptly” notify the other parties to the case and provide them with a chance to respond. Lumpkin waited two weeks to notify Tremane and his lawyers about the communications and an additional nine days to provide them with the actual emails, which they later succeeded in getting unsealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When Tremane’s lawyers read the emails between Drummond and Lumpkin, they realized why Tremane was being punished so harshly for the cell phones, Bass Castro Alves said in an interview.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It was shocking to read that Attorney General Drummond prejudiced the court against Tremane while that same court was deciding whether Tremane deserved a new trial, and that Attorney General Drummond also enlisted the court in his effort to portray Tremane as a public safety threat to undermine his case for clemency without tipping us off.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The state has not charged Tremane with any crimes in relation to the contraband phones, which were first discovered in May. Bass Castro Alves asked Drummond in August and September to provide her team with all evidence supporting his allegations that Tremane committed criminal acts while on death row, as well as access to the phones and the information stored on them for independent forensic analysis. Without this evidence, “we have been hamstrung in our ability to independently investigate these allegations or to challenge them,” she wrote in her request to Drummond.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Linda Wood and Andre Wood with a photo of Tremane Wood in August 2024.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rU8xajPFgk2MIWXOpa1k.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/27cfc587d2fba1160c2125f91b6920d4><noscript><img alt=\"Linda Wood and Andre Wood with a photo of Tremane Wood in August 2024.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rU8xajPFgk2MIWXOpa1k.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/27cfc587d2fba1160c2125f91b6920d4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Linda Wood and Andre Wood with a photo of Tremane Wood in August 2024. <span class=\"copyright\">Nick Oxford for HuffPost</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>The attorney general declined to turn over the evidence, stating that because his office had not charged Tremane with a crime, he was not entitled to discovery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tremane’s lawyers filed motions to <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/941305374/Motion-To-Recuse\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:recuse Lumpkin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">recuse Lumpkin</a> from Tremane’s case and to <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/941305478/Motion-For-Sanctions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sanction Drummond;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sanction Drummond</a>.

Most of the allegations involved selling or using drugs. The most serious allegation is that Tremane directed a friend incarcerated in a different prison to arrange for another prisoner to be beat up. In the screenshots of the text messages included in the state’s clemency packet, Tremane described the target as someone who killed his female cousin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Wood’s actions on death row in recent years, including distributing drugs and having another inmate viciously beaten, prove that death is the only way to ensure the safety of Oklahomans,” Drummond wrote in a press release, announcing his opposition to Tremane’s clemency request.</span></p><p><span>Tremane admitted to having contraband phones and, at times, “losing his way behind the walls,” he said. “Over the 23 years I’ve been locked up, I’ve done things that I’m not proud of and have made bad choices that I regret,” he continued. “But I’m not a killer.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He also said that the phones provided a way to communicate with his loved ones as much as possible during his limited remaining time. “If you had months to live,” he said, “Wouldn’t you take the risk and break the rules so that you could text your mom ‘Good morning’ every day?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It is a paradox of the clemency process that exceptional rehabilitation is a requirement for mercy. Yet death row prisoners are typically deprived of rehabilitative programs and held in torturous conditions. What’s the point of rehabilitating a person whose punishment is death?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since 2019, some people on death row have been “afforded the opportunity to work on the units or in food service in a limited capacity,” Thompson wrote, noting that such decisions are made “based on behavior” of the prisoners. “Program referrals for all inmates are based upon an objective assessment tool, availability and security level. All inmates have access to religious services.”</span></p><p><span>Tremane spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement, which is recognized by the United Nations as a form of torture.

In 2008: “No programs assessed due to inmate serving death sentence.” 2010: “Offender has no assessed program needs due to his sentence.”</span></p><p><span>Last year, Tremane organized a petition for death row prisoners asking leadership for a counseling group where they could have a “safe and confidential space where [sic] inmates can openly express and process their grief and receive guidance from trained professionals.” Their request was ignored. Of the 15 men who signed the petition, three have been executed.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 354px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A handwritten petition organized by Tremane Wood and signed by other men on death row requesting a grief counseling group.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QkKOtwgzhQQfDl_hRZ5gJQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/87ee5bd24794a29a934abaa8f7c40bb1><noscript><img alt=\"A handwritten petition organized by Tremane Wood and signed by other men on death row requesting a grief counseling group.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QkKOtwgzhQQfDl_hRZ5gJQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/87ee5bd24794a29a934abaa8f7c40bb1 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A handwritten petition organized by Tremane Wood and signed by other men on death row requesting a grief counseling group. <span class=\"copyright\">Tremane Wood's Clemency Application</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Thompson said DOC is not aware of a petition but confirmed that Tremane sent a letter to staff requesting a grief counseling group. In response, staff purchased a workbook titled “Hardcore Grief Recovery” and offered it to every individual sentenced to death, Thompson wrote.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>“Attorney General Drummond is pushing for Tremane’s execution, not because Tremane killed anyone (he hasn’t, and the actual killer has confessed), not because the death penalty reflects the sentence the jury actually wanted for Tremane (it doesn’t, and the jury foreperson has said so before the Oklahoma legislature), not because he’s the most culpable (he’s not, the actual killer confessed and received a life sentence),” Bass Castro Alves wrote in an email.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Rather, Attorney General Drummond is pushing for Tremane to be executed because Tremane has at times lost his way in prison, not unlike many of the thousands of incarcerated people discarded by the system, and made choices that he has come to regret. I’m hopeful that the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board will see the Attorney General’s tactics for what they are: A massive distraction from the powerful evidence that Tremane’s death sentence is unjustifiable and that his life is worth saving.”</span></p><p><span>When I visited Tremane last year, we spent about five hours seated on opposite sides of a long table in the prison’s visitation room. He took responsibility for participating in the robbery that led to Ronnie’s death and expressed remorse for the pain it caused the victims, Brandy, Lanita and his family. He described the ways he had grown since the time of the crime and spoke with pride about the support he provides to his family. He was fiercely protective of his mother, an unwavering source of love.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By August, he had visibly declined, his face gaunt and his eyes quick to fill with tears. Since he was only allowed one visit per week, he had to forfeit one of his few remaining visits with his loved ones in order to speak with me. Separated by bars and plexiglass, we had to lean in so close to hear one another through the holes in the wall that I could feel his breath.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There was no clock visible in the no-contact visitation area. Without warning, a guard approached the back door of the small holding cell Tremane was in. The hour was up. As we stumbled through hurried goodbyes, I stared at the relatively healthy 45-year-old in front of me who, if all goes according to the government’s plan, will soon be dead. I watched as he crouched down, his hands behind his back, to stick his wrists through the bean port for the guard to cuff.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In my effort to bear witness to every second I could, I was left with a final memory of Tremane that is not dissimilar to the image he told me he wanted to avoid: his body in a position of surrender to the people who would kill him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tremane has told his friends and family he doesn’t want them in the room if he is executed. He doesn’t want them to see him strapped to a gurney with a needle in his arm every time they close their eyes. He doesn’t want that image to be their last memory of him.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Andre Wood at his mother Linda Wood&#39;s home in Oklahoma City in August 2024.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EqvQueThnotxK89_VG3FSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/a06e2fad8e3bee85c0d73417b6a40422><noscript><img alt=\"Andre Wood at his mother Linda Wood&#39;s home in Oklahoma City in August 2024.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EqvQueThnotxK89_VG3FSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/a06e2fad8e3bee85c0d73417b6a40422 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Andre Wood at his mother Linda Wood's home in Oklahoma City in August 2024. <span class=\"copyright\">Nick Oxford for HuffPost</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Most of the people closest to him say they couldn’t watch. “I can’t consciously sit there and watch someone kill my brother and there be nothing I can do about it,” Andre said. “I would feel like I’m failing my little brother because I’m his big brother. How am I not protecting him?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“And knowing that no matter how much I yell and scream and bash against the window and say, ‘It’s not right,’ there’s nothing that’s going to stop it. I can’t. I can’t.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Brenden Wood, Brandy’s son with Tremane, built a relationship with his mom through letters, phone calls and visits during her incarceration. But the relatives who raised him blocked him from getting to know Tremane. When Brandy returned home, she took Brenden to visit Tremane so that the boy could form his own opinion about his dad.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I was tearing up, trying to keep my composure.

They made him out to be a monster. Acting like someone can’t make a mistake and be forgiven.”</span></p><p><span>Despite Tremane’s effort to shield his family from the memory of his execution, Brenden is adamant that he bear witness to the killing. An active duty member of the military, he had to request permission for emergency leave to travel to Oklahoma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“If I were on my deathbed, I wouldn’t want the only thing for me to see is white walls. I would like to know that family is there,” Brenden said in an interview. “This is my way of showing it doesn’t matter what anybody else says about you, it’s not going to change my opinion of you. I am here for you.”</span></p><p><span>Brenden continued: “I haven’t had nearly enough time to actually have a full relationship with him. This could be possibly the last thing I could do.”</span></p><p><span>Brandy plans to wait outside the prison in the parking lot to drive her son home. “I know that it’s real, but I keep telling myself, ‘this isn’t real,’ because I don’t want it to happen,” Brandy said in August, tears streaming down her face. “I know that he will always have a place in my heart and I am so very thankful that we are blessed to have such a special piece of him — our son Brenden.”&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>I can’t consciously sit there and watch someone kill my brother and there be nothing I can do about it ...

On Oct. 4, Linda made the two-hour drive with Tremane’s sister-in-law Micky Winn-Scannell, her daughter Brooklyn Wood, and Tremane’s other niece Andreyanna Wood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The prison requires visitors under 18 to bring a copy of their birth certificate, but Brooklyn, 17, was previously able to enter with her ID. This time, though, a guard refused to let her in.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Is there no way we can speak to somebody?” Brooklyn pleaded. “My uncle only has 40 days left to live.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The guards wouldn’t budge, so Brooklyn sat in the car with her mom in the parking lot until the visit was over. She had just gotten braces, and she was looking forward to showing Tremane.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Winn-Scannell initially tried to keep her kids from Tremane, hoping to spare them the pain of growing close to someone who would be executed. Despite her efforts, they got to know him through letters and phone calls. Winn-Scannell eventually stopped trying to discourage the relationship once she saw how much Brooklyn benefited from being able to confide in her uncle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Winn-Scannell worries how her daughter, who has previously struggled with self-harm, will cope without Tremane. During a recent phone call with Tremane, she recorded him saying, “I love you niece-y, mwah, mwah, mwah.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If he is executed, Winn-Scannell plans to use the audio to make Brooklyn a teddy bear with a customizable voice message. “If everything doesn’t turn around, at least she’ll have that,” Winn-Scannell said.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 354px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Tremane Wood with his mother Linda Wood at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q63qOTaSxg2aa9KAQwbjBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/71dd43ca0b82f8345f879a531d5a6b81><noscript><img alt=\"Tremane Wood with his mother Linda Wood at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q63qOTaSxg2aa9KAQwbjBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/71dd43ca0b82f8345f879a531d5a6b81 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Tremane Wood with his mother Linda Wood at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. <span class=\"copyright\">Tremane Wood's Clemency Application</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>On Oct. 9, the day of Tremane’s 46th birthday, he was given a full-body physical. A doctor checked his vitals and put a tourniquet on his arm and leg to check the condition of his veins. They needed to make sure he was healthy enough to be killed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After the physical, he was taken to the visitation room, where he sat chained across the table from about a dozen prison officials and staffers. The warden read his death warrant, detailing how he would be killed. He took note of the paralyzing drug used — if he felt pain, he would likely be unable to express it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He was given his 35-day packet, paperwork directing him to choose his last meal, his list of witnesses (a maximum of five) and what he would like done with his body and property. The prison provided takeout menus from several restaurants in McAlester, including Big Macs BBQ, likely a reference to the Oklahoma State Penitentiary’s nickname. The menu includes dishes like the “Behind Bars Rib,” the “Jail Bird Smoked Turkey” and the “Life Sentence Tray,” although the latter exceeds the prison’s $25 allowance. (Thompson said that DOC “does not provide menus from </span><em><span>any</span></em><span> specific restaurant as options for inmates choosing their last meals.”)</span></p><p><span>The warden detailed what “death watch,” the final seven days ahead of the execution date, would entail. Tremane will be subject to constant surveillance. Any time he leaves the cell, he will be strip-searched. If he brushes his teeth, he has to return the toothbrush when he is done. The lights will never go off.</span></p><p><span>It was an unsettling experience for him, sitting in that room, surrounded by strangers watching him learn the details of how he will die.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It makes you feel lonely,” he said.</span></p><p><em>If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://988lifeline.org/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:988lifeline.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">988lifeline.org</a>&nbsp;for mental health support.

Abigail Spanberger, the Democrat facing Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s governor race, in Norfolk early Saturday afternoon. In the evening, he will be in Newark with Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is taking on GOP former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.</p><p>Nine years after leaving office, Obama remains the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate — a reality underscored by his high-profile appearances on the final weekend of two of 2025’s most important contests. Obama has also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/barack-obama-donald-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:stepped up his warnings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">stepped up his warnings</a> about what he says is the damage being wrought to the country by President Donald Trump.</p><p>He’s the closer after a number of ambitious Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democratic-campaign-trail-2028-hopefuls?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:also hit the trail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">also hit the trail</a> for the two candidates. The list of Democratic governors to campaign with Spanberger and Sherrill includes Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a Thursday appearance with Sherrill, touted their efforts to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City, and lambasted Trump’s decision to terminate that project.</p><p>“The problem is that Jack Ciattarelli knows that standing up for New Jersey would require standing up to Donald Trump, and he just doesn’t have the backbone to do that,” Buttigieg said.</p><p>Obama has slowly ramped up his involvement in both gubernatorial elections. He cut ads for both candidates that began airing in mid-October.</p><p>After voting in Bridgewater on Friday, Ciattarelli — whose near miss in the 2021 New Jersey governor’s race was an early indicator of the state’s rightward shift in the 2024 presidential race, when Trump closed his losing margin from 16 percentage points in 2020 to 6 points last year — downplayed any impact Obama’s appearance with Sherrill might have in the closing days of the campaign.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“This is what I refer to as the choreography of campaigns, but at the end of day, I really believe this, particularly in New Jersey, a candidate has to win the race, and that’s why I get up and down the state every day and engage with people every day, shake hands every single day.” Ciattarelli said. “I think we’ve done that a hell of a lot better than my opponent.”</p><p>The Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, which are held a year after presidential elections, are widely viewed as an important gauge of the nation’s political mood almost a year into a new presidency. One year into Obama’s White House tenure, Republican Bob McDonnell’s win in Virginia and Chris Christie’s win in New Jersey offered previews of the red wave that was to come in the 2010 midterms.</p><p>Spanberger and Sherrill are favored in the blue-leaning states, but wins are no lock: Four years ago, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor race; in New Jersey, Sherrill hasn’t been able to pull away after several public polls found her with a single-digit edge over Ciattarelli.</p><p>Both of Obama’s Saturday stops — Newark and Norfolk — are in areas with significant Black populations. Over the last several election cycles he has appeared often with Virginia Democratic candidates at base-rallying events in the Hampton Roads region.</p><p>CNN’s Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.</p><p>In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”</p><p>Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.</p><p>Three people also died during storm preparations.</p><p>Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjis.gov.jm%2Fgovernment-establishes-website-to-mobilise-support-after-hurricane-melissa-passes%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CSophie.Tanno%40cnn.com%7Ce02d55974552412c479c08de1790eda8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638974108682955445%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2xX0%2FDCf3bAzbbXFGQFYka4JMx54bA8xZeq3zAPFO8s%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">statement</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1J6WrM9r9I\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jamaican government officials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Jamaican government officials</a> said.</p><p>Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a><noscript><img alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.</p><p>Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.</p><h3>‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba</h3><p>Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.</p><p>The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth.

But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.</p><p>In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”</p><p>Lee also sat down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. The two discussed ways to expand cooperation and advance denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean presidential office.</p><p>Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.</p><p>North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.</p><p>Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.</p><p>Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>“I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.</p><p>Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/economy/japan-economy-recession-hnk-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:mounting economic woes.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">mounting economic woes.</a></p><p>She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.</p><p>“I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.</p><p>The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warm camaraderie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warm camaraderie</a> showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.</p><p>For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.</p><p>In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”</p><p>“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p><p>Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/04/americas/canada-china-michael-chong-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic rows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic rows</a>.

It’s not something I would have done… which is to put in place that advertisement, and so I apologized to him.”</p><p>The ad was released last month by the government of Canada’s Ontario province and featured audio from <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F24%2Fpolitics%2Freagan-1987-speech-tariffs-trade-vis&amp;data=05%7C02%7Chelen.regan%40cnn.com%7Cbeabfa0d296b4be7cf0008de19163fa8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638975780735270043%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=P%2Fe9RsYmkNzF5X376vhkZenSvE975vx2FqOmHHGjTZE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan </a>criticizing tariffs on foreign goods.</p><p>CNN’s Joyce Jiang and Yoonjung Seo contributed to this story</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

He similarly points downward when speaking about a location ― “this country” or “Buffalo” ― to connect a broader political message to the specific location of the rally: Don’t worry, you ― or your city ― will directly benefit from this political agenda.</p><p>Why does <em>any</em> of this matter?

At worst, it distances the politician from the way the rest of us communicate, Hart said. Think of how stilted Richard Nixon came across when juxtaposed with the cool, calm, collected body language of John F. Kennedy during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:1960 presidential debate.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">1960 presidential debate.</a>&nbsp;(Kennedy would of course go on to win.)</p><p>Stiff body language “is not the case for populist politicians whose gestures seem to be more spontaneous, conversational in style and genuinely charismatic,” Hart said. “They often reflect, albeit in an exaggerated form, the way ordinary people interact. It’s part of the populist playbook.”</p><p>Another high-profile populist pointer, according to Hart? <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/topic/boris-johnson\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Boris Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Boris Johnson</a>, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;No word if <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/donald-trump-s-secret-weapon-boris-style-hair/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unruly, über-blond;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unruly, über-blond</a> hair is part of the populist playbook, too.</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-inauguration-body-launguage_n_678e9c9be4b02856224be450?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Body Language Experts Reveal Their Thoughts On Trump&#39;s Major Kiss Fail At The Inauguration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Body Language Experts Reveal Their Thoughts On Trump&#39;s Major Kiss Fail At The Inauguration</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-weird-capitalization-language_n_66f1a9fae4b03a18c4a2602c?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why Does Trump Do That Weird Capitalization Thing?

businesses.</p><p>Anxiety over chip shortages began when the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government.</p><p>China, in response, banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s Chinese CEO.</p><p>Beijing blamed what it said on Saturday was &quot;the Dutch government&#39;s improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises&quot; for leading to &quot;the current chaos in the global supply chain&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,&quot; a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement, without offering specifics.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Those talks on Friday were &quot;a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on... the introduction and implementation of export controls&quot;, Gill said in a statement on Saturday.</p><p>The discussions covered &quot;controls on rare earth elements introduced or proposed by China, as well as an update on controls and developments on the EU side&quot;, he said.</p><p>The statement did not mention Nexperia specifically.</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>Its chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components, as well as consumer and mobile electronics such as refrigerators.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"
