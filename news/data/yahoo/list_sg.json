Such a move would allow Republicans to open the government while bypassing Democratic demands. But it would open the possibility that Democrats could pass into law sweeping progressive reforms and roll back swaths of the conservative agenda if they control both chambers of Congress at some point in the future. Trump may not care what happens when he’s no longer president, but eliminating the filibuster would represent a fundamental political shift.</p><p>This new wrinkle in Trump’s strategy will no doubt pile more pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune. And while Trump can shift his position from one moment to the next, his new gambit may indicate he’s more interested in crushing Democrats than seeking a way out of the increasingly damaging shutdown. Republican leaders in both parties have stated they don’t support ending the filibuster because of the implications for any future Democratic majority.</p><p>What’s so galling in the current shutdown is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/obamacare-premiums-government-shutdown-aca-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:enhanced Obamacare subsidies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">enhanced Obamacare subsidies</a>, without which millions of citizens will see <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/obamacare-premiums-increase-2026-coverage?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the cost of health care rocket;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the cost of health care rocket</a>.</p><p>Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again.

But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.</p><p>Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.</p><p>But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.</p><p>One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/boston-judge-intervene-snap-payments?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:US District Judge Indira Talwani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">US District Judge Indira Talwani</a> signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US District Court Judge Indira Talwani attends the Investiture Ceremony for US District Judge Brian Murphy at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 17. - Brian Snyder/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NH0N1jnTbbrkXpyqeBl16g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c02f393a166e1720e07b308ed593360b><noscript><img alt=\"US District Court Judge Indira Talwani attends the Investiture Ceremony for US District Judge Brian Murphy at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 17. - Brian Snyder/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NH0N1jnTbbrkXpyqeBl16g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c02f393a166e1720e07b308ed593360b class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US District Court Judge Indira Talwani attends the Investiture Ceremony for US District Judge Brian Murphy at the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 17. - Brian Snyder/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>“Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.</p><p>“The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.</p><h3>Is there any hope for a breakthrough?</h3><p>Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn.

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s move came after the Dutch chipmaker&#39;s Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS</p><p>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>&quot;While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>&quot;Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention &quot;concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company&#39;s day-to-day operations&quot;.</p><p>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, &quot;to work toward a constructive solution,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION</p><p>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p>On October 4, China&#39;s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a &quot;war room&quot; to monitor the situation.</p><p>Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p><p>(Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p></div></article></div>",

Xinjiang in a \"candid\" first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea (STR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Japan&#39;s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Friday she raised &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the South China Sea, Hong Kong and Xinjiang in a &quot;candid&quot; first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Xi in turn told Japan&#39;s first woman prime minister, long seen as a China hawk, at the talks in South Korea that he hopes her government will have a &quot;correct understanding&quot; of his country, according to state media.</p><p>Takaichi has been a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan&#39;s war dead and is an outspoken backer of Taiwan, advocating security ties with the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory.</p><p>With both having separately met US President Donald Trump in recent days, Takaichi said she told Xi at the APEC summit that she wanted a &quot;strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between Japan and China&quot;.</p><p>However, she told reporters that she also raised a number of thorny issues with the Chinese leader, saying that it was &quot;important for us to engage in direct, candid dialogue&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We... expressed serious concerns regarding actions in the South China Sea, as well as the situations in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,&quot; Takaichi said.</p><p>Beijing vehemently denies accusations of human rights abuses against the Uyghurs, saying its policies in Xinjiang in northwestern China have eradicated extremism and boosted development.</p><p>China has sweeping assertions of sovereignty over the South China Sea despite an international ruling in 2016 concluding its claims have no legal basis.</p><p>Takaichi said she also raised with Xi the Japanese-administered Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea&nbsp;where Japanese and Chinese vessels frequently face off.</p><p>She also said she spoke to Xi about export controls on items including rare earths that are vital for a wide range of industries.</p><p>Takaichi added that she also pressed for the release of Japanese citizens detained in China and requested that the safety of Japanese expatriates in China be ensured.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I conveyed that we would like these matters to be addressed,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Regarding Taiwan, there was some discussion from the Chinese side,&quot; Takaichi said.</p><p>&quot;I stated that for the stability and security in this region, maintaining good cross-strait relations is important,&quot; she said.</p><p>- History -</p><p>Xi told Takaichi he hoped Japan would also stick to the &quot;general direction of peaceful, friendly and cooperative bilateral relations&quot;, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>He added that Japan &quot;should adhere to and fulfil clear provisions on major issues such as history&quot; as outlined in political documents agreed by Japan and China, Xinhua said.</p><p>Visits to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo by senior Japanese politicians have long angered China, as well as the two Koreas, because it also honours convicted war criminals.</p><p>Takaichi was also an acolyte of right-wing former premier Shinzo Abe.</p><p>Long-pacifist Japan, a close US ally, has increased security ties with Washington as well as defence spending, while moving to acquire &quot;counter-strike&quot; capabilities.</p><p>Around 60,000 US military personnel are based in Japan. Takaichi hosted Trump this week, with both making speeches on the deck of an American aircraft carrier.</p><p>She announced last week Japan would spend two percent of gross domestic product on defence this fiscal year, two years ahead of schedule.</p><p>&quot;It could be a frosty get-to-know-you meeting as Xi Jinping has not sent a congratulatory message to Takaichi, wary of her reputation as a China hawk,&quot; Yee Kuang Heng, a professor at the University of Tokyo&#39;s Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP before the meeting.</p><p>&quot;Overall though, stability is a shared priority,&quot; Heng said.</p><p>hih-stu/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”</p><p>At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.</p><p>But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.</p><p>“Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.</p><p>The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:longest-ever government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">longest-ever government shutdown</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/snap-benefits-food-stamps-explainer?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Critical food aid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Critical food aid</a> for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

ferocious storm has devastated Caribbean islands and is expected to become an &quot;extratropical cyclone&quot; later in the day, reaching the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest advisory.</p><p>&quot;After Melissa becomes post-tropical, a brief period of heavy rain and gusty winds is possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight,&quot; the NHC added.</p><p>Flooding was expected to subside in the Bahamas although high water could persist in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and neighboring Dominican Republic, the agency said.</p><p>The storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.</p><p>Melissa smashed into both Jamaica and Cuba with enormous force, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery.</p><p>In Jamaica, &quot;the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Melissa is now at 19,&quot; including nine in Westmoreland and eight in St. Elizabeth, both parishes in the Caribbean island&#39;s hard-hit west, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told local news outlets including the Jamaica Gleaner.</p><p>Communications and transportation access remains largely down in Jamaica and Cuba, and comprehensive assessment of the damage could take days.</p><p>In impoverished Haiti, the country&#39;s civil defense agency said Thursday that the death toll had risen to 30, with 20 people injured and another 20 missing.</p><p>It said more than 1,000 homes have been flooded, with some 16,000 people in shelters.</p><p>In the east of the communist island of Cuba, battling its worst economic crisis in decades, people struggled through inundated streets lined with flooded and collapsed homes.</p><p>The storm smashed windows, downed power cables and mobile communications, and tore off roofs and tree branches.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

(for Friday&#39;s losses) was uncertainty about the future policy of the Federal Reserve,&quot; said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.</p><p>&quot;The negative response to Meta&#39;s bloated AI

agreement.</p><p>While the Fed on Wednesday cut interest rates as expected, Powell&#39;s follow-up comments that another reduction by the end of the year was not guaranteed hit sentiment.</p><p>The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan held their rates steady Thursday.</p><p>The ECB&#39;s stance was reinforced by data Friday showing inflation eased closer to the central bank&#39;s two-percent target in October.</p><p>European stocks slipped in Friday midday trades, tracking losses on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq closed down 1.6 percent Thursday.</p><p>An earnings report released by Apple after US markets closed showed quarterly revenue that beat estimates, powered by iPhone and services revenue.</p><p>Amazon also reported earnings that were better than expected, driven by surging

agreed to cut some tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing committed to keeping supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>Trump and Xi have not yet signed a comprehensive trade agreement, and

There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope.
