made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.</p><p>The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.</p><p>Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.</p><p>“Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.</p><p>The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/business/rare-earth-minerals-trump-china-xi?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\"

for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.</p><p>In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.</p><p>Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.</p><p>China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.</p><p>One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.</p><p>On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.</p><p>The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.</p><p>“We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.</p><h3>Troubled trade</h3><p>The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.</p><p>At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.</p><p>Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.</p><p>Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.</p><p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”</p><p>Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.</p><p>Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.</p><p>But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.</p><p>Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.</p><p>The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.</p><p>CNN’s John Liu contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

eurozone economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>The Bank of Japan held interest rates steady on Thursday, after the US Federal Reserve delivered a second quarter-point rate cut.</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell&#39;s announcement, however, cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar on Wednesday.</p><p>The Nasdaq later recovered, finishing at a fourth straight record after another gain by artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value.</p><p>US big tech companies were in focus again Thursday, following a mixed reaction to earnings reports from Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft after the Wall Street close.</p><p>&quot;These latest results highlight the

Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing &quot;on an equal basis&quot; to China and Russia -- an announcement made just minutes before he held a high-stakes summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>The move came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow had successfully tested a nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered underwater drone, in defiance of Washington&#39;s warnings.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump wrote in a social media post.</p><p>Following that announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the weapon tests announced by Putin did not constitute a direct test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia regularly runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to testing nuclear warheads, which the United States last did in 1992, or testing weapons systems capable of carrying atomic warheads.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country, praising his own efforts to do &quot;a complete update and renovation of existing weapons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Thousands of warheads -</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In total, SIPRI estimates that the nine nuclear-armed countries -- Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea -- possess more than 12,200 warheads.</p><div

continues</button></div><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t do testing... we&#39;ve halted it years, many years ago,&quot; he said, adding that it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again because others are testing.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d like to see denuclearization... denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>He claimed &quot;it&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>Trump&nbsp;kept the location and dates for testing vague during the news conference, but said earlier it would &quot;begin immediately.&quot;</p><p>- China defends nuclear ban -</p><p>The Republican president was in South Korea to meet with Xi, with the leaders of the world&#39;s top two economies coming face-to-face for the first time in Trump&#39;s second term.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun later urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban &quot;and take concrete actions to safeguard the global nuclear disarmament.&quot;</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>- Russia&#39;s &#39;Poseidon&#39; drone -</p><p>Putin announced on Wednesday the successful testing of a nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered underwater drone, the second weapons test in days after that of the Burevestnik cruise missile.</p><p>In televised remarks broadcast from a military hospital treating Russian soldiers wounded in Ukraine, Putin said there was &quot;no way to intercept&quot; the torpedo drone dubbed &quot;Poseidon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Peskov told journalists, including AFP, during a daily briefing on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.&quot;</p><p>He implied that Russia would also test nuclear warheads if Trump ordered a live test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>sla/dhw/ane/pbt/rlp/aha</p></div></article></div>",

What isn’t pretty should be handled privately… or so she taught me, and her mom taught her, and so on and so forth. But the page is a place of connection. If I’m not fully present here, then what’s the point?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To put it bluntly, my organs are falling out. That’s a slight exaggeration. “Descending” is more accurate. However I frame it, it’s a disconcerting thought. My uterus, well, there’s a sign on that one that reads, “We’re done here!” But my bladder and my rectum, though performing their functions poorly, still seem necessary. I can’t have them planning their escapes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/husband-hearse-death-halloween-decoration_n_68f7bf30e4b0dbac45915c5d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Screamed When I Saw What Was Parked In Our Driveway.

Then I Learned My Husband Had Bought It.</a></strong></p><p><span>The news of my organs descending surprised me. Like many women following childbirth, I’ve struggled with “peezing” (a word contributed by Liz Lemon from “30 Rock”) and other mild forms of stress incontinence for a long time. But since my mid-40s, those problems have intensified alongside a more troubling inability to defecate completely.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So after probing in hard-to-reach places, a urogynecologist pronounces me prolapsed. According to a handout my doctor gave me&nbsp; by the American Urogynecologic Society, </span><a href=\"https://www.voicesforpfd.org/pelvic-organ-prolapse/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=6110279%2047&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADnw6TTmxw29Gm09-bivaxmjeyB4t&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpOfHBhAxEiw%20Am1SwEpakHT5P_zc6efgePsrh-R1MzRs68zTi821f6Q0qUShdC539CV5eJxoC1isQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:pelvic organ prolapse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>pelvic organ prolapse</span></a>, or POP,<span> “occurs when the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue weaken or tear. This causes the pelvic organs to fall downward into the vagina, similar to a hernia. Women may feel or see tissue coming out of the opening of their vagina as this progresses.” </span></p><p><span>POP can happen for a variety of reasons, among them muscle and nerve damage from pregnancy and childbirth, hormonal changes related to menopause, constant straining due to constipation, repeatedly lifting heavy objects and genetic predisposition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To investigate the possible relationship between my prolapsing organs and my constipation, my doctor suggests that I undergo what feels like a new level of humiliation called a defecography. It’s not like a colonoscopy, where you theoretically sleep through the entire thing. In this case, medical professionals watch you poop while you are alert and fully present, live and on-camera. The test reveals whether there is some anatomical reason why you can’t eliminate properly.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-ad-voiceover-actors-police_n_68fcfec8e4b011e8088689fa?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say</a></strong></p><p><span>I wonder if it’s worth it. Maybe I should just embrace my “pooping problem,” as my youngest calls it, and limp along without additional interventions. I can just live with the prolapses for now, right? It seems like the easiest and most peaceful route sometimes — just settling. But we all want more, don’t we? We want true healing. We want to feel better. We want to be fully restored.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I remain stubbornly curious about what </span><em><span>could </span></em><span>be, and schedule the test. But I give myself&nbsp;</span><span>permission to say “no” the morning of — “no” when I get there and see what awaits me, “no” when they ask me to… you get the idea. I’ve never used the “no,” but having it emboldens me to be braver than I am.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>My doctor suggests that I undergo what feels like a new level of humiliation called a defecography.

You suck down a bunch of barium and load yourself up vaginally with barium paste. The nurse then pages the radiologist: “The defo </span><em><span>(that’s me) </span></em><span>is ready.” She notices I’m listening to her —&nbsp;</span><em><span>What else would I be doing?&nbsp;</span></em><span>— and looks a little embarrassed. She apologizes quickly for referring to me as “defo,” saying it’s only to prepare the radiologist for what he’s about to do. I guess referring to me as a person is too much work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then the radiologist arrives, explains the process, and inserts a large amount of barium paste into my rectum via syringe. If you have other anal issues like I do…a fissure, hemorrhoids, that last part is especially unpleasant. It’s hard not to feel violated unless your radiologist is gifted with an unusual amount of finesse. Mine was not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-hospice-coping-dying-parent_n_68dc0865e4b0d2dd31581907?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You</a></strong></p><p><span>Next is the fun part. You sit on an elevated platform sporting a special commode. With the radiologist and nurse next to you, you defecate on camera and on command. The radiologist stares at a screen to judge how well you eliminate and gathers evidence revealing why you cannot void completely. In my case, he found that my uterus descends and pinches off part of my rectum when I bear down, so I can only partially evacuate. Hooray? Maybe. I cry all the way home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I see my urogynecologist several weeks later, she’s elated: “I’m so glad that I can do something to help you!” </span><em><span>She’s a good doctor. </span></em><span>She explains that she’d like to insert a silicone device called a pessary up into my vagina. It’s designed to hold up my uterus and prevent it from pinching off my rectum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The pessary looks like a mushroom with a top that secures via suction and a long stem that extends down to my vaginal opening. Once I’ve assumed the position, she requests that I ready myself and relax. </span><em><span>That doesn’t bode well. </span></em><span>With significant force, she installs the medieval workhorse. According to the nurses, she “places” the pessary, but what I experience feels more like a pain-inducing shove. I arrive home feeling like I’ve got a tampon protruding and a little askew. I’m supposed to function like this for 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, the pessary changes nothing. The pooping problem persists. My urogynecologist explains that she could still surgically fix the prolapses, pin up or remove my uterus, in hopes that stooling would improve. She looks at me: “What do </span><em><span>you </span></em><span>think we should do?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fundamental-christian-university-job-spank-kids_n_68fe1ed8e4b0049ce5fd2e27?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler</a></strong></p><p><span>My internal response is paradoxical. One part of me screams, </span><em><span>What!?! YOU are supposed to be the expert! Why are you asking ME!?! </span></em><span>The other ruminates, </span><em><span>Thank you for acknowledging that I might have some wisdom to contribute.&nbsp;</span></em></p><p><span>“I’ll have to think about it.”</span></p><p><span>The end? Not really, and I hope not. But this is where we all are a lot of time. In between. In process. Unresolved. We all wander around hurting sometimes and can’t fix it. We’re all trying to make meaning of suffering while we wait for change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But wherever this path takes me, I’m done with pretty and private. I’m done with the societal expectation that women’s bodies should look the same regardless of the trauma they have sustained, that aging should be invisible. My body is a ragged landscape of stories that I think I’m meant to tell. I am more than pretty.

It also conducted about 10 combined exercise planning meetings.</p><p>To ensure safety and prevent mid-air collisions, aircraft was also separated into blocks of airspace at different heights, and there were clear processes for transit lanes, said Lieutenant Colonel Dai Jing, who is ops officer for 6 Div/HQ SS.</p><p>“We made sure everybody knew their roles very well and was well-coordinated, such that when we brought everything together and executed it together, it was safe, but also operationally to standard,” she added.</p><p>The SAF also trialled the use of rapid 3D-mapping technology to help its tactical troops achieve near real-time visualisation of the urban environment they were operating in.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height:

valuable, given that it is not something that can be done in Singapore, added MAJ Chin, who is commanding officer of 23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery.</p><p>MAJ Lee, the F-16 pilot, concurred, noting that Shoalwater Bay had urban operations training facilities, jungle terrain, as well as mountainous areas, which allowed the RSAF and army to work towards shared objectives.</p><p>“The challenge is mainly that we don’t have a lot of experience with the army, so there were a lot of communications issues at the start, but then we worked through them and sorted out our differences during the exercise,” he said.</p><p>He added: “It’s a good opportunity for us, because it’s one of the rare exercises that we get to interact with the army controllers.</p><p>“So we get to learn their lingo, run through the processes with them and improve on those so we get familiar with how to support them in their missions.”</p><p><a

MARIN)</figcaption></div></figure><p>France&#39;s former president Nicolas Sarkozy has received a prison visit from the justice minister, a source close to the case said on Thursday, despite a prosecutor warning that it could undermine judicial independence.</p><p>Gerald Darmanin met Sarkozy on Wednesday evening at La Sante prison in the presence of the jail&#39;s director, and discussed the former head of state&#39;s security arrangements, the source told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Before he was locked up, Darmanin said he intended to visit Sarkozy to ensure his security conditions were adequate for his &quot;exceptional status&quot;.</p><p>Top prosecutor Remy Heitz at the time warned that such a visit risked &quot;undermining the independence of magistrates&quot;.</p><p>Fifty-seven percent of French people also disapproved of the visit, according to a survey of 1,025 people published last week by Taluna Harris.</p><p>The right-wing leader who led France from 2007 to 2012 was found guilty last month of trying to get election campaign funding from Moamer Kadhafi&#39;s Libya.</p><p>The 70-year-old was handed a five-year prison term for criminal conspiracy.</p><p>Sarkozy&#39;s legal team has requested his release pending his appeal trial, but said he is expected to remain in jail for at least &quot;three weeks to a month&quot;.</p><p>Two security officers are stationed in a neighbouring cell to ensure his protection, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said.</p><p>Sarkozy is the first former head of a European Union state to be jailed, and the first French leader to be incarcerated since Philippe Petain, the Nazi collaborationist head of state who was jailed after World War II.</p><p>He has faced a flurry of legal woes since losing his re-election bid in 2012, having already been convicted in two other cases.</p><p>Sarkozy still enjoys some popularity on the French right. Days before starting his prison sentence, he visited French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace.</p><p>pab/ekf/ah/fg</p></div></article></div>",
