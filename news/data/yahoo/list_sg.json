His client, a 20-year-old US citizen who has not been publicly identified, is cooperating with authorities and has not been formally charged, attorney Amir Makled said.</p><p>“We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled said in an email to CNN.</p><p>“The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.</p><p>The attorney said he is concerned about “rhetoric that’s harmful to the large Arab and Muslim population in the state of Michigan, specifically in Dearborn” since reports of the alleged plot emerged.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>How the alleged plot was uncovered</h3><p>The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.</p><p>An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.</p><p>“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.</p><p>The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.</p><p>It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.</p><p>Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”</p><p>The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.</p><p>There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.</p><h3>‘No current threat to public safety’</h3><p>The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.</p><p>“There is no current threat to public safety.”</p><p>The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”</p><p>“We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.</p><p>In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.</p><p>She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.</p><p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.</p><p>“I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”</p><p>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Nicki Brown and Hanna Park contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a post on Facebook.</p><p>&quot;By my order, consolidated groups of the Special Operations Forces, the Special Operations Command, the Security Service of Ukraine, and other units of Ukraine&#39;s defence forces... are operating in the city,&quot; he added, without saying how long they had been there.</p><p>Special forces are a branch of the military trained to carry out covert operations, often through unconventional warfare such as sabotage and diversion.</p><p>Videos published on social media appeared to show helicopters flying over the

said.</p><p>The city&#39;s capture would allow Russian forces to sweep further into the Donbas region and provide a propaganda boost for the Kremlin, which claims the region as its own.</p><p>Russia,

Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aLH_MPxj5_cKGW6Vjc9GQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/0d97dc3e005954b3e89b79d413413baf><noscript><img alt=\"An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aLH_MPxj5_cKGW6Vjc9GQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/0d97dc3e005954b3e89b79d413413baf class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.</p><p>“I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous.

The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.</p><p>Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.</p><p>In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.</p><p>Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.</p><p>“The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dF263EPnoe27Kn.4MGnmPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/591e76154cc720ddaae972af0621e0b2><noscript><img alt=\"Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dF263EPnoe27Kn.4MGnmPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/591e76154cc720ddaae972af0621e0b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://nycrimecommission.org/richard-aborn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Richard Aborn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Richard Aborn</a>, president of the nonprofit Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.</p><p>“I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”</p><p>Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.</p><p>“If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent.

She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption at the department.</p><p>Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.</p><p>So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics. NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.</p><p>As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.</p><p>While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.</p><p>Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.</p><p>The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.</p><p>“What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”</p><p>CNN’s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

the main opposition candidates being either jailed or disqualified.</p><p>But a heavy crackdown and the lack of options sparked mass protests around the country.</p><p>&quot;The government strongly

Roger Wicker of Mississippi) said Friday. The Trump administration has not publicly released the basis for its growing offensive, but there have reportedly been internal struggles over whether the strikes are justifiable, and fears of being seen as arguing otherwise among government lawyers. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who led the U.S. Southern Command, retired earlier this month after clashing with Hegseth over the legality of the attacks, according to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>CNN</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Among those monitoring the situation is Harrison Mann, a 13-year Army officer now with the progressive group Win Without War. Mann. Mann quit his last military job at the Defense Intelligence Agency over U.S. support for Israel’s devastating offensive in Gaza, which itself appeared to violate U.S. and international law, and has in recent weeks helped organize a national campaign of billboards and other outreach called “Not What You Signed Up For?” to inform U.S. soldiers about resources for legal counseling and community support as the Trump administration has used the military in unprecedented ways abroad and domestically. It’s “a frightening and isolating experience” to receive orders that may be unlawful and try to assess how to react and it’s “increasingly a possibility,” Mann said, so the effort seeks to help individuals avoid violations.</span></p><p><span>HuffPost discussed developments around Venezuela with Mann on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56><noscript><img alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America. <span class=\"copyright\">OUTFRONT Media</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><strong>Thinking back to being on the inside at a moment like this, with the U.S. spiraling into conflict and a pretty unclear mission, whether narcotics or regime change, how would you be feeling about it — and how do you imagine folks being asked to carry out these orders in Latin America are? What are their options? And what’s your sense of whether legal efforts, like court challenges against the Trump administration’s domestic deployment of troops, will be fast enough to catch up, given how quickly the actual deployments are moving?</strong></p><p><span>A lot of them are probably hoping that they don’t get asked to do something illegal. When we look at all the strikes on boats that have happened so far, that’s dozens, probably hundreds, of uniformed service members in terms of how many it takes from getting an order to actually dropping a bomb or doing a drone strike on one of these boats who participated in something that they were quite confident was not legal. That’s still a small minority of all of the troops who have now been deployed to the region, between the Air Force and the growing number of Navy ships that we have outside of Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-adelita-grijavla_n_69052e61e4b0060501ac5325?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay</a></strong></p><p><span>In government in general, at higher echelons you have lawyers who are assigned to you who are meant to be your counsel, JAGs if you’re in the military. But as you go further down the ranks, you don’t have legal consultation. If you’re a more junior officer or a junior enlisted, you’re taking it on good faith that the orders you’re receiving have been run through some kind of legal review and are going to be lawful, and I think that assumption is increasingly in question with how this administration has deployed the military both in the Caribbean and in American cities. Our campaign put a billboard [near] SOUTHCOM but we started with National Guard deployments and the broader issue of the administration trying to use the military in illegal ways… which has both moral implications and legal implications for the people who choose to give those orders and the people who choose to carry them out.</span></p><p><span>I hope that legal challenges carry the day, but I don’t think it’s wise to expect that or have total faith that that’s gonna happen. In terms of domestic deployments, if the president invokes the Insurrection Act, then he can put both Guard and active-duty troops basically anywhere he wants. And when we’re talking about overseas strikes and the potential war in Venezuela, the legal constraints to that were really abandoned a long time ago with Congress abandoning its role in constructing and containing foreign policy. In some ways the boat strikes are crossing new red lines in terms of illegal use of the military but a lot of folks have pointed out that the legal justifications for these strikes are not dramatically flimsier than the justifications for a lot of bombings around the Middle East for the past 10-plus years over multiple presidents. There was already a precedent that the president could blow up anybody who he said was a terrorist to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The scariest part from an American perspective about the strikes in the Caribbean so far is that at the same time that members of the Trump administration are calling a broad swath of Americans terrorists, via [</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:National Security Presidential Memorandum 7;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>National Security Presidential Memorandum 7</span></a><span>] and via public statements by people like Stephen Miller, they’re also asserting their right to drone strike anybody the president calls a terrorist.</span></p><p><strong>We’re at this moment after chaos in Hegseth’s office, the firing of a lot of top commanders, skipping over some to appoint those perceived as loyal, and removing an independent press corps at the Pentagon. Is the U.S. military establishment in a position to be managing this kind of operation and how concerned are you about transparency and the chain of command now?</strong></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-times-trump-prediction_n_690507c2e4b0b48d8a1c6705?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump</a></strong></p><p><span>Are they administratively capable of continuing to bomb people? I think yes.

What we don’t know is whether the officers who take their place are going to feel the same way. What I can’t tell you is how much solidarity there is at the flag officer rank… or if that replacement is going to learn the lesson that Hegseth is trying to teach them, which is “get in line or I’ll fire you.” It remains to be seen what behavior we’re going to see from our upper echelon in military leadership.</span></p><p><strong>Presidents finding creative legal justifications to kill people abroad and Congress letting them do it is not new. Looking at the escalation now and the limited guardrails against it, are you thinking about lessons that could have been learned from the post-9/11 War on Terror? And specifically lessons from U.S. intervention in Latin America for decades? How is that history being overlooked and what could we take from it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>We should understand these events as continuation of the War on Terror – we never rejected that logic. We pulled some troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the idea we should be unilaterally bombing without a clear connection to how that makes Americans safer and the contention that anybody you call a terrorist is somebody you can then bomb or detain or otherwise mistreat outside of the law was never really challenged.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The lesson I would hope we learned from America’s history in Latin America is that setting aside the moral objections to regime change in countries in the region, it’s also disastrous for us politically and economically. Whatever you think of Venezuela now, turning it into a warzone is not going to make it more stable, solve the economic crisis there or stem the refugees that are flowing into neighboring countries and contributing to burdening some of the resources of countries in the region. The lesson that folks like [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio learned is that we just didn’t try hard enough in the 1980s and now we finally have an opportunity to finish the job. Their theory is that if you regime-change Venezuela, that will cut off their oil to Cuba, so then you can regime-change Cuba. These people learned no lesson of not giving up on the foreign policy of 50 or 60 years ago.</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-snap-food-stamps_n_6904f12de4b00c26f071625a?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits</a></strong></p><p><strong>The anti-war movement generally faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Some have felt that with Trump’s “America First” line and MAGA base, which questioned intervention against Iran alongside Israel, those conservatives could be helpful. How are you thinking about organizing around this?</strong></p><p><span>In</span><span>execution, “America First” seems to have led to a lot of foreign interventions. I am encouraged when Americans from every political affiliation oppose dangerous and unnecessary foreign intervention; it’s to me too soon to see whether that has translated into an actually more rational foreign policy. The trend you’re talking about certainly exists … but it’s way too soon to say that it’s really going to restrain the foreign policy of the president or of his party. I wish it did, I hope it does, but it certainly seems that the death of the neocons has been highly exaggerated.</span></p><p><span>One aspect of Trump’s second term is that he’s performing exaggerated versions of policies that we’ve had for 20 years and he’s doing it without attempting to justify it in moral terms, and that makes it easier for a lot of people to understand why this kind of interventionism is wrong. On Capitol Hill, some representatives who were not interested in pushing back against foreign interventions are getting a little more interested. In part because of the awakening effect of U.S. support for the genocide in Gaza, there’s certainly a lot more Americans who are paying attention to how the U.S. comports itself abroad. I’ve been heartened to see at least in the Democratic Party pretty consistent positions against these interventions without a lot of equivocating, and to see some Republicans start at least rhetorically moving against them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ll have to see what votes come out for a war powers resolution against intervention in Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My organization sees this as a moment to explain to people in this country and to elected leaders why they have to pay attention to the connection between foreign policy and our lives here at home. And I think putting the National Guard in our streets while we start blowing up random people in boats makes it a lot easier to explain that what we do overseas doesn’t stay there.</span></p><p><strong>Sufficient pushback, a climbdown by Venezuela or just Trump volatility are probably our ways out of this, or maybe it’s some combination of all three. In terms of damage and danger until that happens, what barometers will you track to understand this situation, in terms of human life, violations of U.S. and international law and broader instability going forward?</strong></p><p><span>Domestically I’ll be looking at how many members of Congress and other institutions speak out against it and try to prevent it. I’m personally thinking about what echelons of our military leadership acquiesce versus push back against what could be patently unlawful orders... we shouldn’t assume the first strike is gonna be on a Venezuelan military base. It could be something the administration thinks is a drug lab but turns out to be somebody’s house; it could be civilian or political leadership. If and when this begins, there’s already been a massive economic refugee outflow from Venezuela in part because of sanctions we’ve applied. I’ll be looking at not just the loss of life but the number of people who have to flee.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ve seen Trump personally be satisfied with showy actions that he can call a win. Iran fits that bill, to a lesser extent the Gaza ceasefire [in January] did. I don’t know whether that will work in Venezuela given the success so far of his hawks, which in this case includes both [Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor] Stephen Miller and Marco Rubio.</span></p><p><em><span>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/snap-websites-are-hitting-back-at-the-gop-by-giving-them-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine_n_6904ecb8e4b0b48d8a1c505f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-the-view_n_69047b34e4b0d05408abd167?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rand-paul-slams-trump-strike-venezuela-drug-vessel_n_68b989f3e4b0e20f601acde8?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-venezuela-escalation-war_n_69052bc3e4b0060501ac52e2?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.</p><p>A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.</p><p>The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.</p><p>Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.</p><p>By contrast, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and neighboring Myrnohrad was tightening.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.</p><p>On Thursday, the commander in chief of Ukrainian forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said after meeting commanders in the Pokrovsk area that the situation was “difficult, but the statements of Russian propaganda about the alleged blockade” of Ukrainian troops “do not correspond to reality.”</p><p>Syrskyi said Russian troops were accumulating in urban areas and changing locations. “In addition to UAVs, strike-search operations are being conducted in the city,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had given orders to “strengthen the protection of supply and evacuation routes.”</p><p>Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.</p><p>Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.</p><p>Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.</p><h3>Pipelines blown up</h3><p>As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.</p><p>On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.</p><p>“The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine</figcaption></div></figure><p>It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting.

Is this the kind of coercive diplomacy you’ve written about or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> It’s firstly important to clarify what we mean by a “nuclear test.” Russia has tested missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. But, in the traditional sense, a nuclear test is a denotation of a nuclear explosive device. Think of the July 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert that you may have seen depicted in the 2023 film “Oppenheimer” (although after the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, most nuclear explosive tests were done underground rather than in the atmosphere). This is not what Russia has done, and I don’t believe this is what the US is threatening to resume, either.</p><p>There are two main reasons why countries test military technologies. The first is to see whether a weapon works as designed. The second is to send a political message to other countries. I think there’s a certain amount of signaling attached to Russia’s recent missile tests. Although it’s difficult to decipher Moscow’s intentions, in testing these technologies, the Kremlin may be implicitly saying to the United States and NATO: Back off in Ukraine — look what we might do if you continue to interfere.</p><h3>More worried about a nuclear crisis today than four years ago</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Do you generally think the threat of a nuclear standoff has increased in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>I’m more worried about the possibility of a serious nuclear crisis today than I was at the end of 2021. This is in large part because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the possibility that Moscow may continue to brandish its nuclear arsenal to help it prevail in that war. But it’s not just that. The possibility of a US-China nuclear standoff over Taiwan is not trivial, especially if one side misinterprets the other’s resolve to fight. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are expanding too, and there is the potential for disaster on the Korean Peninsula arising from an accident or miscalculation. Not to mention the perennial possibility of a nuclear-tinged crisis between India and Pakistan. This doesn’t mean that the probability of a standoff is high. Actually, I still think it’s relatively low. But given the stakes involved, even a small increase in the risk — say, 2% — is cause for concern.</p><h3>Do US missile defenses work?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Coincidentally, there’s a movie on Netflix about the 30 minutes it would take for an intercontinental ballistic missile to reach the US and the difficulty of intercepting such a missile. The Pentagon felt the need to produce a memo responding to the film. Are missile defense systems any better than the coin toss suggested by the movie?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’ll leave that question to technical experts who understand the intricacies of missile defense systems better than I do. I will say that, from a strategic standpoint, there’s value in convincing your adversaries that your missile defense systems are impenetrable. This can strengthen deterrence: If adversaries believe their missiles won’t get through, they may be less likely to fire them.</p><h3>Would Trump’s Golden Dome solve the nuclear threat?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Trump (taking cues from Project 2025) has called for a new “</strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/golden-dome-missile-test-election?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Golden Dome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong>Golden Dome</strong></a><strong>” missile defense shield. Is it worth the cost and would that do anything to solve the nuclear threat?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>That’s a complicated question. On the surface, missile defense sounds great – and in some ways it is. Consider, for example, the relatively high rate at which Israel successfully shot down missiles fired by Iran in their war over the summer. However, in the long run, developing these systems can encourage your adversaries to develop technologies that circumvent your defenses, or to develop missile defenses of their own. In the end, you may get a costly arms race that leaves both sides worse off. The United States and the Soviet Union recognized this during the Cold War, which is one reason they agreed to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p><h3>Will the expiring Obama-era nuclear treaty be renegotiated?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: The US and Russia have a nuclear arms treaty that expires in February. New START, negotiated during the Obama administration, limits the size of the countries’ nuclear stockpiles. Will it be renegotiated?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The prospects currently look bleak. As long as there is tension over the war in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine Russia agreeing to a new arms control deal with the United States. If that tension is alleviated, the prospects for a deal would improve.</p><h3>What about China?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Should China or other countries be a part of that process?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>Many US policymakers would like to include China as part of an arms control deal with Russia. The problem is that China’s nuclear capabilities currently lag behind Russia and the United States. Countries usually don’t like to negotiate from a position of weakness. As China’s nuclear arsenal expands — a trend that is happening — a trilateral deal becomes more likely, especially if Beijing achieves parity with the other two countries.</p><h3>Bring back the test ban treaty?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the 1990s but failed to get the US Senate to ratify it. Trump isn’t talking about reviving it, but if he could get the handful of nuclear powers that have likewise not ratified the test ban treaty — including China, Russia, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel — to ratify it, would he be a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The US Senate vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999 was a setback for global nonproliferation. There are obstacles to bringing the CTBT into force in the current political environment. If the Trump administration was able to get this done, it would be a major foreign policy achievement.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
