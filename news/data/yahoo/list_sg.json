New studies show that many of those extensions contain hazardous chemicals. - NickyLloyd/E+/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Almost every Black woman or girl has, at some point, purchased hair extensions for box braids, boho braids, twists or faux locs.</p><p>For many Black women, these “protective styles” are worn year-round to protect and maintain their natural hair. For others, they’re a pre-vacation splurge — an easy way to shield one’s curls from the harshness of salty ocean water or a chlorine-filled pool. Beauty shops feature walls of extension colors — 1b, 30, 27, 24 or maybe even 613 — ready to be purchased and installed by a pro or a patient auntie.</p><p>But a growing number of studies are revealing dozens of potentially dangerous chemicals and carcinogens in these hair extensions: a Consumer Reports study <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/wigs-hair-extensions/braiding-hair-heavy-metals-vocs-follow-up-test-a9549045438/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published this week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published this week</a> found lead in 29 brands of extensions, while a peer-reviewed study <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/hair-extensions-contain-many-more-dangerous-chemicals-previously-thought\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published earlier in February;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published earlier in February</a> found dozens of hazardous chemicals, some of which have been linked with cancer, birth defects and reproductive issues, <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.5c00549\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:across 43 hair samples;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">across 43 hair samples</a>. Some samples in the latter study had chemicals that should have required consumer warning labels under California’s Proposition 65.</p><p>Research has yet to determine whether or not these hair extensions are dangerous or could be causing illness. But both studies indicate how a largely unregulated billion-dollar industry fueled by Black women may also be disproportionately harming them.</p><h3>Hair extensions are still commonly used</h3><p>Elissia Franklin, a research scientist and analytic chemist at the Silent Spring Institute, grew up with “all the Black girl styles,” she said, like box braids, regular braids, relaxed hair and straightened hair. In the past, she’d get rashes on her neck after wearing extensions in her hair, but it wasn’t until she was researching flame retardants in couches as an adult that she realized the same chemicals existed in the hair commonly sold at beauty supply stores.</p><p>Her research, published in February in the American Chemical Society journal Environment &amp; Health, analyzed common brands of both synthetic and human hair purchased online and from local beauty supply stores. Included in those samples: flame retardants, pesticides, organotins (which are linked to skin irritation) and more. More than 80% of the hair samples tested contained chemicals linked to breast cancer specifically, and all but two of the 43 samples tested contained known hazardous chemicals.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034><noscript><img alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Franklin’s work follows a 2025 Consumer Reports study, which made the rounds on social media last year after finding carcinogens in 10 synthetic braiding hair extensions.</p><p>But even as research about these chemicals mounts, business continues as usual in many hair braiding shops across the country.</p><p>The owner of Passion Braiding Salon outside of Austin, Texas said she heard about some chemicals in braiding extension hair on social media a few months ago, but hasn’t heard concerns from clients, most of whom bring hair purchased elsewhere to appointments. When asked if she was worried about her own exposure to harmful products, she said she wasn’t sure.</p><p>Marcy Jones, a braider on the South Side of Chicago, has been braiding hair for seven years. While she has heard of chemicals in hair extensions — some of her clients say they’re “allergic” to the hair, so Jones will pre-wash the extensions — she said she disinfects her tools and isn’t worried about her own exposure.</p><p>One braider at Braids By Queen in Dallas said she wasn’t aware of chemicals in braiding hair, but she always washes any extensions in hot water before use, which she’s done since she was a child in Benin. One Charlotte, North Carolina braider said she hadn’t heard of any risks at all.</p><p>While many people might use hair extensions without obvious problems, irritation is relatively common. Natural hair forums, websites and influencers have for years provided information about these so-called “allergic reactions.” Soaking the hair in apple cider vinegar is a common at-home remedy that may help reduce irritation with mixed results. Still, box braids and other extension styles can start at $200, depending on the length, width and type, and can take up to 10 hours to complete — meaning many Black women have learned to grin and bear the discomfort.</p><p>Hennii Dorsey is a co-owner of The Griyn Thumb salon just outside of Atlanta. She grew up wearing braids with extensions and never had a problem, she said, but that changed about 10 years ago. After braiding her hair with extensions, her head felt like it was covered in red ants, she said, “like they were biting me all over my scalp.”</p><p>“When I looked at my scalp, I noticed it was red, like it was burning,” Dorsey said. “I had to shave it off, that’s how bad the burn was.”</p><p>The braiding hair changed, she said. She began noticing labels like “non-flammable,” making her wonder about the types of chemicals manufacturers treated the hair with. In her own salon, she began warning clients about the potential side effects of hair extensions. Now, she refuses to use hair extensions altogether — synthetic or human.</p><p>Women who want extensions will take the risk no matter what the research says, Dorsey said, “even if they think it’s cancer-causing.”</p><h3>‘What Black hair product is safe?’</h3><p>Though many of the hair braiders interviewed seemed unconcerned by the potential harm they may face, those braiders are the “most vulnerable population,” said Franklin, the researcher. They work with these products day-in and day out, sometimes for decades, seeing multiple clients a week.</p><p>“I do understand where there’s hesitancies,” Franklin said. “What Black hair product is safe? I do think that braiders should be aware, but also so should the manufacturers. It shouldn’t be on the hair braiders to make individual decisions.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517><noscript><img alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>For every Black woman, the calculus around hair safety can feel ever-changing. Relaxers and chemical straighteners, touted for their easy-to-manage outcomes, saw a decline in use as more people learned about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/hair-straightening-formaldehyde-fda-deadline?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde</a>, a key ingredient in relaxer products and a carcinogen.</p><p>Now hair extensions, used by many women as “protective styles” for their natural hair, may also be dangerous, to say nothing of weaves or wigs. And the potential harms exist beyond the hair itself: many brands of gels, glue, edge-control, oil sheen, detangling spray and other everyday products for Black women have been shown to contain <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde-releasing preservatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde-releasing preservatives</a>.</p><p>“Black women use more hair products, and we are doing our hair in these very intense styles, more often than probably any other group of people,” Franklin said. “Those chemicals shouldn’t be in the products.”</p><p>Still, Franklin gets the sense that no one in her circle is shocked anymore, she said. There’s an expectation that some products are hazardous, she said, and there’s no way to really know what product is completely safe. A product considered to be nonhazardous could later prove to be harmful after all.</p><p>Everything carries some sort of risk, Franklin said — our food, our water, even our clothes. Trying to reduce that risk, she said, is all we can do.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

arch-foes last June.</p><p>The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against military targets in Iran on Saturday, sparking a rapid Iranian retaliation towards Israel.</p><p>In the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, Orit Baisa, 42, rushed to an underground car park as soon as he heard the air raid sirens warning of an incoming missile barrage.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t have a shelter,

And yeah, so once we got the alert that there is a missile attack, we came to the shelter&quot;, said Siposova, a 31-year-old originally from Slovakia who now lives in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Roi Elba came to the shelter with his dog Gaia to wait out a missile salvo.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s the place to be when it&#39;s unsafe outside.

Nothing concerns us. Our lives must continue as normal&quot;, Ghazala Arar, a resident of the nearby Jalazone camp, told AFP.</p><p>For most, the main inconvenience remained the Israeli military&#39;s closure of many of the hundreds of checkpoints that restrict movement in the Palestinian territory, locking some people out of their homes.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m trying to go to Jenin, but all the checkpoints are closed. The attack happened in an instant -- we are trapped here&quot;, Rajwa Atatra, who had come to Ramallah from the northern city of Jenin to visit her brother, told AFP.</p><p>vid-pho-lba/jd/dcp</p></div></article></div>",

that US and Israeli warplanes were attacking Iran.</p><p>Like many Iranians living in exile in neighbouring Turkey, Reza, who did not want to give his surname, has been glued to his phone since news broke that Israel and the United States had begun air strikes on Iran.</p><p>Despite worrying about their families, most exiles in Turkey&#39;s largest city told AFP they were happy with the strikes, which US President Donald Trump had threatened in January over Iran&#39;s protest crackdown that left thousands dead.</p><p>&quot;America is attacking the military bases, the people who 40 days ago were killing our children, so they are helping us. This war is no good, people will die, but I&#39;m happy,&quot; Reza, a mature student, told AFP.</p><p>Ali, a film director who like almost all the Iranians interviewed by AFP did not give his surname, agreed.</p><p>&quot;Now people in Iran are full of&nbsp;hope and they are very, very happy,&quot; Ali said.</p><p>&quot;Iranians have been counting the minutes until America came to destroy the regime.&quot;</p><p>Over the past few weeks, Trump has sent warships and dozens of fighter planes to the Middle East, raising fears of a US strike -- even as US and Iranians diplomats held indirect talks on Iran&#39;s nuclear programme.</p><p>But early on Saturday, the tensions came to a head as Israeli and US warplanes began hitting targets in Iran, with Trump urging Iranians to stand up to their government and telling them: &quot;The hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>Turkey, which shares a 500-kilometre (300-mile) border with Iran, currently hosts more than 74,000 Iranians with residence permits and some 5,000 refugees.</p><p>While the unrest has raised fears of an influx of people, there have been no reports of unusual activity at the Turkey-Iran border so far.</p><p>- &#39;Difficult days ahead&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I&#39;m both worried and happy, hoping for Iran&#39;s freedom,&quot; said Sepideh, a former teacher, who told AFP she managed to speak to a few friends in the morning, despite Iran cutting off all internet access.</p><p>Even with the internet shutdown, Mehdi, an engineer from the northern Iranian city of Tabriz, said he had managed to reach his family on Friday night.</p><p>&quot;Everyone was aware of the possibility of war, so they have been saving fuel and storing enough food. They are planning to move to rural areas,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We never wanted war in our country.

Saturday as campaigning kicked off for next month&#39;s presidential election in the oil-rich central African nation.</p><p>Thousands of supporters turned out to watch Sassou Nguesso parade in an open-topped convertible at&nbsp;a rally held by the president&#39;s Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the country&#39;s economic and oil capital Pointe-Noire, on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>Campaigning will end on March 13, with the first round of voting on March 15.</p><p>Six opposition candidates have formally confirmed they will be standing, including first-time 34-year-old candidate Destin Gavin, from the Republican Movement (MR).</p><p>But the fragmented and muzzled opposition stands little chance of winning, with the ruling party promising a &quot;wave&quot; in favour of its &quot;patriarch&quot;, according to roadside campaign posters.</p><p>&quot;Have no fear, on March 15, we will win!&quot; Sassou Nguesso told the rally, dressed in a white shirt adorned with an elephant.</p><p>The career military officer first led Congo under the one-party system from 1979 to 1992 before losing the country&#39;s first multi-party elections to former prime minister Pascal Lissouba.</p><p>He overthrew Lissouba in a civil war to return to power in 1997.</p><p>Earlier this month, he announced he would be seeking a new five-year term, which, according to the constitution, would be his last.</p><p>Sassou Nguesso is one of Africa&#39;s longest-ruling leaders after Paul Biya of Cameroon, who has been in office since 1982, and Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power in a 1979 coup.</p><p>He was the victor in 2002 and 2009 and was able to stand again -- and win -- in 2016 and 2021 after a constitutional change that removed the upper age limit of 70 and extended the maximum number of terms of office.</p><p>- Contested elections -</p><p>Congo-Brazzaville, a former French colony, is rich in oil but nearly half of its six million people live below the poverty line.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

in Sassou Nguesso, some pointed to the country&#39;s economic worries.</p><p>&quot;We came here to support him, but the Congolese people are suffering. What we want is work,&quot; says Flora Kouka, a nurse.</p><p>At Saturday&#39;s rally, Sassou Nguesso touted his economic record all the same, pointing to the development of the roads, fossil fuel sector and farming, and conceded he would have to pass the baton at some point.</p><p>&quot;Our generation is laying the groundwork for the youth to pick up the torch one day,&quot; he said.</p><p>His political opponents have systematically contested all of his election victories since 2002.</p><p>Two candidates who ran in the 2016 elections -- General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko and Andre Okombi Salissa -- are still being held after convictions for &quot;attacking internal security&quot; in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>They had strongly disputed the official results, which gave Sassou Nguesso 60 percent of the vote.</p><p>NGOs and civil society groups regularly condemn violations of civil liberties and threats against political opponents.</p><p>The president is nonetheless reputed to have brought a degree of stability back to the country scarred by civil war in the 1990s and to a region plagued by conflict.</p><p>clt/phz/sbk/st</p></div></article></div>",

And both of those outcomes were on me.</span></p><p><span>That moment revealed a pattern I was reluctant to face. Even though I was divorced with 50/50 custody, I often treated parenting as a task I could delegate. I was trying too hard to be liked. I wanted to be the fun dad, not the firm one — and that meant avoiding some of the more mundane or difficult responsibilities.

Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Reena B. Patel</span></a><span>, is whether they get defensive when asked to take responsibility. </span></p><p><span>“That defensiveness is usually a sign that you know you’re not pulling your weight,” she said. Other warning signs include expecting partners to handle the majority of emotional labor and avoiding tasks until someone else steps in.</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-according-to-men_l_6880f2b9e4b0a3d10a1fbbf3?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;</a></strong></p><p><span>Scott said the first step is uncomfortable but simple: “Approach your partner and say, ‘I want to make sure I’m doing my part in managing our life together. Could we sit together and talk about something like the weekly schedule?’” The goal isn’t to take over but to participate with genuine interest.</span></p><p><span>Planning was Garcia’s breakthrough: “PLAN! I never used to plan anything. Now, if I don’t write it down or put it on my calendar, it won’t happen.”</span></p><p><span>Letting go of pride was the first hurdle Westerholtz had to face. </span></p><p><span>“Feeling useless at first” was the hardest part, he said. “Vulnerability isn’t something most men are trained in. I had to learn not to jump to fixing, but to actually be with pain or mess: my own and others’.”</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stepparent-toxic-comments_l_693c65afe4b018dc36f1ba4f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents</a></strong></p><p><span>Westerholtz now checks in weekly with his partner and uses a shared calendar with reminders like “pack lunch” and “doctor follow-up.” </span></p><p><span>“Visibility equals responsibility,” he said.</span></p><p><span>These changes have brought broader impacts. “There’s less resentment. More tenderness. My partner doesn’t have to mother me, and that makes space for partnership,” Westerholtz said. </span></p><p><span>The change has also shaped how their son understands masculinity<em>:</em></span><span>&nbsp;“I also see my son learning not just how to survive, but how to be a man who feels, apologizes, and holds others with care.”</span></p><p><span>Consistency became the turning point in Garcia’s relationship with his daughter, but it required moving beyond traditional activities. </span></p><p><span>“Being intentional with our time, and not just taking her to dinners or baseball games, but getting to know her personally, has built a relationship between us that is indescribable,” Garcia said. When Garcia volunteered as a <a href=\"https://dadsofgreatstudents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students)</a>, seeing his daughter light up when he showed up for lunch made her feel supported at school and among friends.</span></p><h2><strong>What Kind Of Man Do You Want To Be?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>These fathers are consciously breaking generational patterns. For Westerholtz, this transformation meant redefining what it means to be a man for his son. “Before, I think I believed being a man meant protecting, fixing and staying strong. Now I think it’s about being present, especially when things are messy.” </span></p><p><span>He tells his son it’s OK to feel scared or sad, and that real strength means talking about emotions instead of shutting down: “We talk about emotions like weather. They pass, but you don’t need to pretend it’s sunny when it’s not.”</span></p><p><span>This shift in emotional openness extends beyond family. In his male friendships, Westerholtz brings the same vulnerability. “It used to be all banter and distraction, surface-level. But when I started being real about how hard things were with my son’s health, I found that most men were relieved. Like they’d been waiting for someone to go first.” As he puts it: “Vulnerability invites connection, not just with our partners, but with our mates too.”</span></p><p><span>Patel notes that children benefit directly when fathers develop emotional maturity. “They model respect, empathy and resilience skills that their children will carry into adulthood. Partners also feel more supported, less stressed and free to be individuals, not caretakers for another adult.”</span></p><p><span>The ‘manchild’ label stings because it highlights a gap between how men see themselves and how they actually show up. Like Garcia and Westerholtz, I’m learning to show up differently for my sons. I need to be a father who is sometimes a friend, not a friend who is sometimes a father. That track meet taught me the hard way. Now, I check every appointment, every schedule, every exam and essay due date. Nothing has been missed since. </span></p><p><span>My sons are 18 now, and my habit of double-checking everything still annoys them. But I would rather that than let them down again.</span></p><p><span>As Westerholtz put it: “You’re not less of a man for softening. You’re just becoming less of a boy.”</span></p><p><strong><em>The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.</em></strong></p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dads-anger-coping-advice_l_686d40a1e4b088c62569aacc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sabrina-carpenter-album-artwork-backlash_n_684af224e4b0f2259d6120d7?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mankeeping-dating-emotional-labor-research_l_682f3305e4b0ef574bf5e553?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-grown-up-goog_l_69a07223e4b0b62154a85d2e?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

The pictures, videos and correspondence showing the <em>current</em> president’s relationship with Epstein have not prompted similar congressional scrutiny.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before Bill Clinton’s deposition on Friday, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) lamented how powerful people who’ve associated with Epstein “haven’t been held accountable and they haven’t even had to answer questions about what they knew and when they knew it.”</span></p><p><span>The release of the Epstein Files — spurred in part by Comer’s committee — has finally brought some accountability, Comer said: “We’ve already seen a lot of very powerful people who have been held accountable by having to resign in disgrace from various boards all over the world.”</span></p><p><span>It’s true: In recent weeks high-level figures in academia, science, law, entertainment and finance have all resigned their positions following revelations of their lengthy and controversial communications with Epstein.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-news-live-updates_n_699c2475e4b0f41da8d4babb?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:U.S. And Israel Attack Iran, OpenAI Reaches Deal With Pentagon After Trump Bans Anthropic: Live Updates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">U.S. And Israel Attack Iran, OpenAI Reaches Deal With Pentagon After Trump Bans Anthropic: Live Updates</a></strong></p><p><span>But, so far, none of the figures in Trump world who were deeply connected to Epstein have faced any fallout, and Republicans have shown no interest in probing the president’s own relationship with Epstein even as they haul in one of his predecessors for questioning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, is testing the durability of the MAGA protection bubble. He lived next door to Epstein in New York City, and the Justice Department’s files revealed he visited Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St. James, even though he’d previously said he’d cut ties with Epstein in 2005, before he was first charged with crimes for prostituting minors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lutnick remains in office despite calls from Democrats and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), for his resignation. But Comer has said he’d be interested in hauling Lutnick before his committee. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), a member of the panel, said this week she’d vote for a subpoena, and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), another committee member, said he believes there’d be enough votes to authorize one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We’re going to continue to ask questions of everyone that shows up in photos on the island and things like that,” Comer said Friday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is still amping up the MAGA faithful on his podcast despite his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:extensive communications and scheming;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">extensive communications and scheming</a> with Epstein.

Without any meaningful sense of itself as an independent branch, the Republican Congress has embraced extreme partisanship and shunted oversight of the administration. The House Oversight Committee interviewed Hillary Clinton, who did not know Epstein and never communicated with him, partly to find out why Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell had been a guest at her daughter’s wedding (she was an invited guest’s plus-one, Clinton said). Trump and first lady Melania Trump were both close friends with Epstein and Maxwell.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kansas-anti-trans-drivers-license_n_69a1fc59e4b03f5cc1b3f981?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Red State Residents In Chaos After Lawmakers Yank Their Driver's Licenses, Birth Certificates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Red State Residents In Chaos After Lawmakers Yank Their Driver's Licenses, Birth Certificates</a></strong></p><p><span>Second, Trump ended the independence of the Department of Justice, meaning that it won’t undertake any investigations without his approval. This corruption of federal law enforcement, enabled by the Supreme Court’s Trump v. U.S. decision, removes yet another lever of oversight and accountability.</span></p><p><span>Third, MAGA is not interested in accountability for Republicans generally. Trump has granted pardons to campaign donors and fraudsters, not to mention more than a thousand rioters, without any pushback. Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) maintains the nominal support of party leadership even though he had an affair with a staffer who later killed herself.</span></p><p><span>All of these are downstream from the final and most important reason: no one in Trump world is more connected to Epstein here than Trump. He was Epstein’s “</span><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/fire-and-fury-the-podcast/epstein-from-beyond-the-grave\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:closest friend;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>closest friend</span></a><span>” for 10 years, according to Epstein.
