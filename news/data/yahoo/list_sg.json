Trump has completely failed to deliver on what clearly was, even at the time, an outlandish promise. Not a single energy-related commodity, including those Trump specifically mentioned during the campaign, costs half as much as it did a year ago, according to a HuffPost analysis of federal data.</p><p>Sarah Longwell, a Republican political consultant who conducts focus groups about Trump voters, said the failure to reduce energy costs is just one piece of why many of them have become disenchanted with him.</p><p>“It’s groceries, healthcare, childcare, energy, education, housing, et cetera.

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers instead falsely stated that energy costs were coming down and attacked the policies of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.</p><p>“Unfortunately, left-wing governors and legislatures in blue states are still doubling down on Joe Biden’s failed and costly ‘Green New Scam’ policies, which are inflating energy prices and hurting families. If these elected officials abandon their failed approach and embrace the president’s energy dominance agenda, their constituents would see lower costs as well,” she said.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gavin-newsom-slams-fox-news-criticism-sat-comments-trump-offensive-remarks_n_69a07c5ee4b059e1adf27971?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gavin Newsom Obliterates Fox News For ‘Weaponizing’ His SAT Comments While Ignoring Trump’s Offensive Remarks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gavin Newsom Obliterates Fox News For ‘Weaponizing’ His SAT Comments While Ignoring Trump’s Offensive Remarks</a></strong></p><p>Trump himself, as he does on most topics, simply lies and claims that energy costs are down, as he did during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. “Nobody can believe when they see the kind of numbers and especially energy, when they see energy going down to numbers like that,” he said, confusingly but falsely.</p><p>On Friday, Trump is to be in the oil export hub of Corpus Christi, part of what his aides have hyped as a tour to highlight the president’s purported focus on affordability. The stop is also coming just days before Texas holds its primary elections, and much of Trump’s appearance could focus on hyping GOP candidates he has endorsed.</p><p>Trump and his aides and allies most often point to the price of gasoline as evidence of his success, likely because it is the only energy commodity that has decreased in price during his first year back in office and one that most Americans have reason to notice several times a week. According to the federal data, gasoline prices fell 9.6% in the year since Trump took office, which many analysts attribute to the OPEC cartel increasing its production of crude oil last year.</p><p>Even there, though, the decrease in retail gas prices continued a longer-term <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GASREGW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:decline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">decline</a> that started under Biden in the late summer of 2022. Over the past month, gas prices have started to increase again, as they typically do each year after the winter holidays. The increase in recent weeks has already erased nearly half of the price drop in Trump’s first year.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-election-promises_n_690946cfe4b048cae5da75da?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Hasn’t Kept His Biggest Campaign Promise One Year Since His Election;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Trump Hasn’t Kept His Biggest Campaign Promise One Year Since His Election</a></strong></p><p>“This is just a continuance of what was already happening,” said Matt Randolph, a longtime oil industry executive.</p><p>Economists also pointed out that oil is a global commodity, meaning that even drastically increased domestic production would not change the price that gasoline refiners pay that much.</p><p>“Energy is traded on global markets. So reducing the cost of energy means that he would have to add enough supply to push down global prices. The U.S. isn’t big enough to do that,” Wolfers said. “But you know what would help? Allowing wind turbines to spin. Solar to be collected, et cetera.”</p><p>Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama White House and now a professor at Harvard University, agreed that Trump’s gutting of wind and solar programs in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act has pushed electricity prices higher. “Their big action was repealing energy credits from IRA which raised costs,” he said.</p><h3>Read Next</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cost-of-living-groceries-affordability_n_690cd81fe4b0799004d3a8e3?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Straight Up Rejects His Supporter&#39;s Concerns About Cost Of Living;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Straight Up Rejects His Supporter&#39;s Concerns About Cost Of Living</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-news-live-updates_n_699c2475e4b0f41da8d4babb?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bill Clinton Faces Epstein Deposition, Ellisons On Brink Of Warner Bros.

This follows ‌a stronger FY25 print of 7.1% (revised up from 6.5% under the earlier base).&quot;</p><p>RADHIKA RAO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DBS BANK, SINGAPORE:</p><p>&quot;At first glance, the momentum in the rebased growth numbers appears to be marginally stronger than the previous trend, with methodological changes expected to have captured ‌updated production structures, wider coverage of segments, ​new ratios, and improved government data ​sets, including those that capture ​activity in the informal sector.</p><p>Service sector performance signals ‌a strong lift, besides double-digit growth ​in manufacturing. The ​October-December quarter also benefited from indirect tax rationalisation and festive demand, in addition to a better faring rural farm sector. ​The rebased numbers ‌are close to our forecast of 7.7% YoY for FY26.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting ​by Kashish Tandon, Meenakshi Maidas in Bengaluru; compiled by ​Abinaya Vijayaraghavan; Editing by Sonia Cheema)</p></div></article></div>",

The alcohol limit determining drink driving will be more than halved, and the authorities are looking to reduce the maximum number of demerit points that can be accumulated to make it easier to suspend reckless drivers.</p><p>Announcing these moves on Feb 27, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Sim Ann said the road traffic situation here was deteriorating, and changes are needed to arrest this.</p><p>Road traffic deaths hit a 10-year high in 2025, with 149 deaths compared with 141 in 2016.</p><p>The number of elderly who died more than doubled from 11 in 2024 to 27 in 2025. All were pedestrians.</p><p>In her speech during the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) budget, Ms Sim said lowering the alcohol limit for drink driving offences is one such change that will be made to address the worsening road traffic situation.</p><p>The drink driving limit today is 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, and has remained unchanged since it was introduced in 1985.</p><p>This is more than double that of Japan and Taiwan, which have limits equivalent to 15 micrograms.</p><p>Ms Sim said the outdated laws in Singapore will be changed, with the limit to be lowered to 15 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.</p><p>Legislative changes will be made later this year.</p><p>The Driver Improvement Points System, more commonly known as <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-demerit-points-higher-fines-for-speeding-offences-from-jan-1-2026-mha\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the demerit points system, will also be tightened.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the demerit points system, will also be tightened.</a></p><p>Ms Sim said MHA is considering reducing the number of demerit points that can be accumulated before a driver is suspended, and also increasing the suspension periods.</p><p>This means errant drivers may be suspended sooner and for longer periods of time.</p><p>“We will not decide on this lightly, but it may be necessary in order to arrest the deteriorating situation, increase deterrence and keep dangerous motorists off the roads,” she said.</p><p>She added the authorities are also concerned with violations involving foreign-registered vehicles, and will be announcing details on several measures to strengthen deterrence and enforcement.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>She also said penalties should be higher in cases where a driver puts another person in danger on purpose, and that this will be studied with a view to introduce a new offence to tackle such behaviour with a higher maximum penalty.</p><p>Ms Sim said it was possible to achieve zero road fatalities, and Singapore should aim for this.</p><p>She noted that Finland’s capital Helsinki recorded zero road fatalities during a one-year period from July 2024 to July 2025.</p><p>The Nordic country is a strong proponent of Vision Zero, which aims to eliminate all traffic deaths and serious injuries.</p><p>The idea of zero road deaths was <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-should-aim-for-zero-road-death-says-safety-champion\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:brought up in 2022 by the Singapore Road Safety Council;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">brought up in 2022 by the Singapore Road Safety Council</a>.</p><p>Ms Sim said: “There is no reason why we cannot aspire to zero road fatalities here in Singapore. But it requires collective recognition that our road culture needs to change.”</p><p>She said that if one asks any group of road users, they would likely say the problem is with the others.</p><p>“When we talk to drivers, they will point out that motorcyclists or cyclists or pedestrians are at fault. If we talk to motorcyclists, we are likely to be told that it is the drivers who are the problem, and so on and so forth,” she said.</p><p>“It can be all too easy to disregard traffic rules or the needs of other road users, especially when we are rushing for time. Giving way does not seem to come as naturally to us as making sure that we do not concede any advantage to other road users. Can we do better?”</p><p>She said all road users, like drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists, mobility device users and pedestrians, will have to be part of the change.</p><p>She also spoke about how the Home Team will be leveraging on technology to <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mha-allows-hiring-auxiliary-cops-from-china-india-prison-trying-sensors-to-monitor-inmates-health\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:deal with manpower constraints;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">deal with manpower constraints</a> and evolving security challenges.</p><p>The Singapore Prison Service will be trialling a robot in the first quarter of 2026, to support officers during patrols and yard supervision, she said.</p><p>Named Protect, the robot is able to patrol autonomously and can be remotely operated to handle potential hazards during incidents.</p><p>For the Singapore Civil Defence Force, Ms Sim said they will be rolling out SG Alert from May 2026. It is a dedicated mass emergency alert system that can broadcast emergency alerts to mobile phones islandwide, or within specific geographical zones.</p><p>No additional app download is needed to receive such notifications.</p><p>Ms Sim also spoke about new Home Team initiatives involving artificial intelligence.</p><p>The Central Narcotics Bureau’s NarcoNet is an AI platform that helps with investigations by making sense of evidence and preparing the necessary documents.</p><p>The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority’s Matrix helps examine documents and extract data, with AI easing manual checks of documents submitted to the authority.</p><p>Ms Sim gave an update on <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ai-chatbot-r-cop-to-be-launched-by-oct-1-to-help-public-lodge-clearer-police-reports-to-save-time\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:R-Cop, the police’s AI chatbot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">R-Cop, the police’s AI chatbot</a> that helps the public lodge clearer police reports.</p><p>She said since its rollout from October 2025, over 90 per cent of users gave positive feedback, and so it will be rolled out to more kiosks by mid-2026.</p><p>R-Cop and other police technologies have led to the merging of several Neighbourhood Police Centres as resources are redeployed more efficiently.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"R-Cop, the police’s AI chatbot that helps the public lodge clearer police reports, will be rolled out to more kiosks by mid-2026.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/in5eOufwbSHMoNSDjw893Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/86eeac30224b3d21cceb0259daedeb73><noscript><img alt=\"R-Cop, the police’s AI chatbot that helps the public lodge clearer police reports, will be rolled out to more kiosks by mid-2026.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/in5eOufwbSHMoNSDjw893Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/86eeac30224b3d21cceb0259daedeb73 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>R-Cop, the police’s AI chatbot that helps the public lodge clearer police reports, will be rolled out to more kiosks by mid-2026.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Ms Sim said there are plans for more such mergers.</p><p>She said while the Home Team presses ahead with AI, it is mindful that AI solutions must be trustworthy and delivered responsibly.</p><p>As such, the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) will develop a proof-of-concept for a centralised AI governance testing and monitoring platform this year to automate AI governance checks.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/home-team-tech-agency-ramps-up-hiring-and-keeps-flexi-work-amid-global-techlash\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:HTX’s AI specialist workforce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">HTX’s AI specialist workforce</a> has grown to 250 as at end-2025, and is on track to reach 400 by end-2026.</p><p>Ms Sim said: “The Home Team increasingly has to do more with less.

Greens, heaping fresh pressure on&nbsp;embattled Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Labour&nbsp;also&nbsp;finished behind the hard-right, anti-immigration&nbsp;Reform UK party in Thursday&#39;s by-election for the Gorton and Denton parliamentary seat in northern Manchester, as the country&#39;s traditional two-party system fractures.</p><p>The&nbsp;result,&nbsp;in a constituency Labour has dominated for decades,&nbsp;shows how the centre-left party is being squeezed by both ends of the political spectrum, and&nbsp;is likely to fuel speculation about how much longer 63-year-old Starmer can stay in office.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons appear more willing to look towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>Shortly after the result was announced early Friday, Green leader Zack Polanski told volunteers the party was &quot;here to replace&quot; Labour.</p><p>This &quot;is what replacing

Rayner said the result &quot;must be a wake-up call&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If we want to make the change we were sent into government to make, we have to be braver,&quot; the Manchester MP added.</p><p>- &#39;Threat&#39; -</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber, won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably to become&nbsp;the&nbsp;Greens&#39; fifth&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;MP in the 650-seat British parliament.</p><p>&quot;We defeated the parties of billionaire donors,&quot; she told jubilant supporters.</p><p>The contest&nbsp;was triggered by ex-lawmaker Andrew Gwynne resigning on health grounds.</p><p>Labour had won the July 2024 general election in a landslide, sweeping Starmer to power and ousting the Conservatives after 14 years in office.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

US&nbsp;sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as Britain&#39;s ambassador to Washington.</p><p>Polls suggest Starmer is now the most unpopular British prime minister since surveys began, and earlier this month he faced down calls from within his own party to resign.</p><p>The next general election is not expected until 2029, but the defeat will intensify pressure on him ahead of May local elections, when the party is predicted to also perform poorly.</p><p>University of Manchester politics lecturer Louise Thompson said it showed Starmer must now &quot;fight a war on two fronts&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Whereas previously he&#39;s focused in a much more laser-like way on Reform... Labour will need to take the Green threat much more seriously,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Values&#39; -</p><p>The Greens had never won a parliamentary by-election before, and ran a grassroots campaign that sought to mobilise the constituency&#39;s 28 percent Muslim population.</p><p>The party, which under Polanski has embraced a full-throated left-wing agenda including higher taxes on the wealthy, is avowedly pro-Palestinian.</p><p>In a likely harbinger for upcoming elections, its campaign was less focused on environmental concerns -- the party&#39;s traditional rallying cry -- and more concerned with cost-of-living pressures and other issues.</p><p>The result was a blow for Brexit champion Nigel Farage, whose Reform party has led national polls for the past year. He called it &quot;a victory for sectarian voting&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Roll on the (local) elections on May 7th,&quot; Farage added. &quot;It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party.&quot;</p><p>Starmer has spent much of his time in office targeting Reform, in particular by toughening Labour&#39;s immigration policies and rhetoric.</p><p>But the stance appears to be alienating elements of the party&#39;s left-wing base and young people.</p><p>Andrea Egan, the new leftist leader of the traditionally Labour-supporting UNISON union, said the Greens had won &quot;because Labour under Starmer has abandoned progressive values, imitating the far-right instead of taking the fight to them&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If the government wants to survive it urgently needs to stand up for workers and defend the fundamental values of our movement,&quot; she added on X.</p><p>bur-jj/mp/st</p></div></article></div>",

The Government will introduce a new guardrail against race-based entities, and amend the foreign interference law so it can take pre-emptive action against hostile information campaigns (HICs) by foreign actors.</p><p>Both measures were announced by Second Minister for Home Affairs Edwin Tong during the debate on his ministry’s budget on Feb 27.</p><p>Mr Tong, who is also Law Minister, said the measures come as Singapore <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-must-strengthen-defences-against-evolving-foreign-interference-tactics-sim-ann\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:monitors a constantly evolving threat environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">monitors a constantly evolving threat environment</a>.</p><p>He said while Singapore thrives by welcoming foreign capital, talent, goods and ideas, being open to information and being highly digitally connected, it can also be exposed to foreign risks.</p><p>He said a new law under the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/new-law-to-protect-racial-harmony-passed\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act (RHA);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act (RHA)</a> will take effect by the end of 2026, to designate race-based entities that have higher potential of being influenced by malicious foreign actors.</p><p>“We will designate clan associations and business associations linked to the Chinese, Malay, and Indian races. These entities will need to disclose foreign donations and affiliations, and meet leadership composition requirements,” he added.</p><p>Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesperson said it was still assessing the list of entities that will be designated.</p><p>“Each designation decision will be made holistically, and the list of designated entities will be made public when ready,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>MHA added it had engaged both clans and business associations when developing the new measures.</p><p>“Overall, the feedback was supportive. Race-based entities understood and accepted the need for the baseline safeguards to mitigate foreign interference risk,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>Meanwhile, a proposal will also be tabled to amend the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mha-to-boost-laws-to-tackle-drugs-foreign-threats-road-safety-concerns\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica)</a> to guard against evolving hostile tactics.</p><p>This will allow the Government to invoke Fica to issue directives against digital platforms such as websites and mobile apps if they believe the platforms are being used to run HICs against Singapore.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Said Mr Tong: “Security threats such as radicalisation, foreign interference, scams, and drugs, are very much driven by external actors. These risks increase when the geopolitical environment becomes more fragmented and disorderly.”</p><p>He noted that hostile foreign actors have become increasingly sophisticated and harder to detect, and are now employing digital tools to launch websites masquerading as credible sources to launch HICs.</p><p>In 2024, Singapore authorities<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-blocks-10-foreign-linked-websites-in-crackdown-of-potential-hostile-disinformation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:identified 10 websites,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> identified 10 websites,</a> masquerading as local websites, that were set up by foreign actors and connected to global networks known to have conducted influence operations in other countries.</p><p>MHA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) directed internet access service providers here to block access to the 10 websites for users in Singapore.</p><p>Said Mr Tong: “We will propose to allow the Government to issue anticipatory directions against mediums of online communications, including websites and mobile applications, should there be indications that they may be used to mount an HIC against Singapore, before they cause actual harm.”</p><p>Under current laws, the Government relies on the Broadcasting Act to block websites deemed to run HICs.</p><p>Mr Tong said that in today’s landscape, emotive and sensitive issues such as race and religion can be more easily exploited by foreign actors to deepen fault lines within the society and manipulate Singaporeans to be aligned with foreign interests at the expense of the nation’s interest.</p><p>“We must therefore continue to strengthen our safeguards against foreign interference.”</p><h2>Radicalised youth</h2><p>Turning to recent examples of overseas terror attacks, Mr Tong reminded Singaporeans that terrorism and violent extremism can take place anytime.</p><p>In November 2025, a 17-year-old student who was inspired by far-right extremists <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/several-injured-after-explosion-at-school-complex-in-indonesian-capital-local-media-reports\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:detonated four explosive devices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">detonated four explosive devices</a> in a Jakarta school mosque, injuring around 100 people.</p><p>A month later, two gunmen with anti-Semitic beliefs <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/at-least-16-dead-after-shooting-at-sydneys-bondi-beach-police-declare-terrorist-incident\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:opened fire at a Jewish gathering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">opened fire at a Jewish gathering</a> at Bondi Beach in Sydney, killing 15 and injuring several others.</p><p>“We cannot discount the possibility of similar attacks here,” said Mr Tong, adding: “The internet has enabled such ideologies to proliferate and reach Singaporeans on their screens, often on their mobile screens.”</p><p>Since 2015, the Internal Security Department (ISD) has dealt with 62 self-radicalised individuals in Singapore.</p><p>Youths have been targeted, with three 14-year-olds dealt with under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for terrorism-related activities, over the past two years.</p><p>“Youths are particularly susceptible. They are digital natives, and they find belonging and purpose in virtual communities,” said Mr Tong.</p><p>In November 2025, a teenager was<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/isa-restriction-order-issued-for-sporean-boy-14-who-recreated-isis-executions-on-roblox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:issued a restriction order under the ISA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> issued a restriction order under the ISA</a> prohibiting him from travelling out of Singapore or accessing social media without approval.</p><p>He had been radicalised online after watching a video of ISIS fighters battling American soldiers in Iraq, later spending up to nine hours a day consuming extremist content.</p><p>Mr Tong said that next week, the Government will launch a refreshed SGSecure campaign that will shift the focus towards actions Singaporeans can take before, during, and after a terrorist attack.</p><p>He said: “We hope Singaporeans will respond to the call to action, stay vigilant, and pick up skills and knowledge to help keep ourselves and fellow Singaporeans, and those around us, safe.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/designated-race-based-clan-business-associations-must-disclose-donations-from-foreign-sources-mha?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

GIMANOV)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Looking out at the blue and yellow cranes towering over the Black Sea horizon, Viktor Berestenko worries about the relentless Russian bombardment of Odesa, Ukraine&#39;s southern port city.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s war, every night,&quot; the head of the Inter Trans logistics company told AFP.</p><p>The main gateway to the Black Sea and beyond, Odesa is a key logistics hub for Ukraine, one of the world&#39;s top agricultural exporters.</p><p>Russia has intensified its attacks on the region -- tripling the number of missile and drone strikes over the last year in what officials call an attempt to cut Ukraine off from the sea.</p><p>&quot;Without ports, Ukraine will be destroyed,&quot; said Berestenko.</p><p>The escalation comes four years into Russia&#39;s invasion, in which Ukraine&#39;s maritime infrastructure has been a target for Moscow.</p><p>The attacks are accepted as part of daily life for the city of around one million people, dotted with ornate 19th-century architecture and where luxury cars pass mobile air defence units along the bustling seaside.</p><p>Russia&#39;s army occupies much of Ukraine&#39;s southern coast, including key port cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk further to the east.</p><p>And in 2023 Moscow walked away from a deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, that facilitated the safe passage of Ukrainian agricultural exports across the Black Sea.</p><p>In response, Kyiv set up an alternative route with vessels hugging the sea&#39;s western coastline from Odesa, along Romania, Bulgaria and through the Bosphorus into the Mediterranean.</p><p>Ukraine touts it as a success, with more than 170 million tonnes of cargo transported through the route, including grain to some 55 countries, mostly in Africa.</p><p>The sales provide a vital source of income for the economy, decimated by the Russian invasion.</p><p>But the surge in strikes is taking a toll.</p><p>Volumes were down 15 percent last year, when some 57 ships and 336 pieces of port equipment were damaged, according to Mykola Kravchuk, head of the state-run Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority in the city.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There were more than 800 air raid alerts in Odesa in 2025 -- &quot;this amounts to more than a month of operational time lost over the course of the year,&quot; Kravchuk told AFP.</p><p>The vast majority of Ukraine&#39;s grain exports go through Odesa.</p><p>- Two-minute warning -</p><p>Incoming ballistic missiles can hit Odesa within two minutes of being launched from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.</p><p>It takes some 45 seconds for a crane operator to climb down, let alone reach a shelter, Berestenko said.</p><p>He scrolled through photos on his phone of burned-out trucks and warehouses damaged by strikes.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s scary, to put it briefly,&quot; said Iryna, who works at the port&#39;s container terminal.</p><p>&quot;When the alarm sounds, we go down... we put our trust in God,&quot; the 41-year-old&nbsp;said.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes alerts can last for three hours, and we sit there.&quot;</p><p>Several strikes have killed port employees or ship crew members.</p><p>In December, a ballistic missile attack killed eight people.</p><p>The strikes also have an environmental toll. Last year an attack on the nearby port of Pivdennyi hit a sunflower oil storage tank, polluting the Black Sea coast.</p><p>Thousands of birds and seahorses were killed as a result, ecologist Vladyslav Belinsky said.</p><p>Ukraine classifies its ports as strategically important infrastructure, limiting access to them.</p><p>Kravchuk said the port industry&#39;s top two priorities are protecting people, &quot;specifically our employees&quot; and making sure the ports stay open.</p><p>After an overnight attack on Friday Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba repeated that the maritime corridor was still operational despite another massive attack on Ukraine&#39;s port facilities.</p><p>But the surge in the attacks has many in the industry and the city on edge.</p><p>&quot;What will be the next steps?&quot; asked logistics chief Berestenko.</p><p>&quot;To occupy Odesa? To cut Ukraine from the sea?&quot;</p><p>cf-ant-jc/jbr/rh</p></div></article></div>",

The authorities will continue to study if Electric Vehicles (EVs) need a different car plate from traditional vehicles, to help first responders identify if specialised procedures are needed during incidents.</p><p>The visual cue will also help the public who see a burning EV to be aware and stay further away from the blaze.</p><p>Law Minister Edwin Tong said this on Feb 27 during the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) budget.</p><p>The move to study the possibility of fitting all EVs in Singapore with specialised car plates was <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/special-licence-plates-for-evs-under-study-to-help-reduce-risk-to-first-responders-in-accidents\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:first raised;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">first raised</a> by National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat in a written parliamentary reply in August 2024. Mr Chee was Transport Minister then.</p><p>Mr Tong, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs, was addressing Parliament on the emerging risks MHA was monitoring.</p><p>One of which was the different risks EVs posed as compared to traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles when they catch fire.</p><p>Said Mr Tong: “While research has shown that fires in electric vehicles are less likely than in internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs pose different risks when they catch fire, and require a different management approach.”</p><p>He said MHA and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will continue studying the use of differentiated licence plates for traditional vehicles and for EVs, to address the emerging fire safety risks.</p><p>The Land Transport Authority and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told The Straits Times they will engage the motor industry and EV owners for their views on the proposal.</p><p>The agencies said: “The proposed EV identifier (EVI) designs must ensure visibility and ease of identification. There will only be one common EVI design for EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles. More details on the final design and implementation process will be provided in due course.”</p><p>Annual statistics from SCDF showed <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-fire-injuries-and-ev-blazes-in-2025-nearly-half-of-emergency-calls-involved-seniors-scdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:four EVs caught fire in 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">four EVs caught fire in 2025</a>, up from just one in 2024.</p><p>LTA data showed there were 50,025 registered EVs in Singapore, including cars, taxis and motorcycles, as at Dec 31, 2025.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Singapore’s total vehicle population was 833,103.</p><h2>AMD fire threat</h2><p>Mr Tong also addressed the fire safety risks posed by<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/over-70-of-residential-amd-fires-between-2022-and-2025-involved-uncertified-modified-devices\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:active mobility devices (AMDs);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> active mobility devices (AMDs)</a>, which include personal mobility devices (PMDs), power-assisted bicycles and personal mobility aids.</p><p>From June 1, keeping non-compliant AMDs, whether at home or elsewhere, that do not meet UL-2272 standards, will be an offence.</p><p>This comes as all AMD fatalities recorded in Singapore involved devices which did not comply with the standards, Mr Tong said.</p><p>Motorised devices here are required by law to meet the UL2272 standard for motorised PMDs and the EN15194 standard for e-bikes. Only AMDs that meet these standards can be imported into and used in Singapore.</p><p>MOT will also tighten regulations in 2026 over the online sale and advertising of AMDs.</p><p>This comes even though the number of AMD fires in Singapore dropped from 67 in 2024 to 49 in 2025. Of those, 34 cases occurred in residential premises.</p><p>Those convicted of using non-compliant AMDs can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders face a fine of up to $20,000, up to a year’s jail, or both.</p><p>Those convicted of selling non-compliant AMDs can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to 24 months, or both. Companies can be fined up to $40,000.</p><p>On fire safety in buildings, Mr Tong highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/final-death-toll-from-hong-kong-fire-put-at-168?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wang Fuk Court blaze in Hong Kong,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Wang Fuk Court blaze in Hong Kong,</a> which killed 168 people in November 2025, after fire spread via the screening netting mounted on bamboo scaffolding surrounding several residential buildings.</p><p>He said Singapore has stringent controls to mitigate the spread of fires and bamboo scaffolds are not permitted at building and construction sites.</p><p>He added: “Nevertheless, the authorities are thoroughly reviewing our scaffolds and netting safety regimes.”</p><p>Mr Tong said Singapore’s overall rate of fire incidents have remained low by international standards - recording about 2,000 incidents annually over the past five years.</p><p>He added: “Over the past three years, over 98 per cent of the buildings which require a Fire Certificate (FC) have ensured that their fire protection systems remain reliable.”</p><p>Owners or occupiers of public buildings are required to obtain an FC to ensure the proper maintenance and working condition of fire safety systems in the building.</p><p>Mr Tong said to incentivise good fire safety management and lower the administrative and processing costs for compliant building owners and occupiers, SCDF will, from April 1, extend the validity of FCs from one year to three years.</p><h2>Challenging drug situation</h2><p>On Singapore’s anti-drugs efforts, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Faishal Ibrahim said while Singapore’s tough laws and enforcement have kept the drug situation under control, the global drug situation was becoming more challenging.</p><p>Pointing to a <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/meth-seizures-in-east-south-east-asia-at-record-high-un\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, Associate Professor Faishal, who is also Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, said 236 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized in East and South-east Asia in 2024.</p><p>“Singapore is vulnerable to these developments. Methamphetamine remains the most commonly abused drug in Singapore, reflecting the worldwide trend,” said Prof Faishal.</p><p>In 2025, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) dismantled 25 drug syndicates and seized over $21 million worth of drugs. To aid their work, the Government will be amending the Misuse of Drugs Act.</p><p>Prof Faishal said: “We will introduce a presumption clause for hair test results. This means that if a controlled drug is found in a person’s hair, they will be presumed to have abused it. This gives CNB a stronger tool for enforcement, since hair tests can detect abuse over a longer period.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/separate-car-plates-being-studied-for-evs-in-spore-to-warn-scdf-public-in-cases-of-fire-mha?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

(STR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Cambodian monks chanted blessings and scattered flowers Friday over 74 cultural artefacts returned to the country after being plundered by a notorious British antiques smuggler.</p><p>Scholar Douglas Latchford -- once regarded as a key authority on Cambodian antiquities -- was charged by prosecutors in New York in 2019 with smuggling looted Cambodian relics to sell on the international black market.</p><p>Cambodia&#39;s culture ministry said the repatriation from Britain of the relics, some dating back more than around 1,000 years, was sealed in a deal with the estate of Latchford -- who died in Bangkok in 2020.</p><p>Before the scandal came to light, Latchford earned acclaim&nbsp;for books detailing the art of the ancient Khmer Empire, which spanned modern-day Cambodia and much else of Southeast Asia.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Hun Many told reporters the return of the artefacts was a matter of &quot;national pride&quot; because the pieces &quot;connect the national soul from our ancestors&#39; era to the current time&quot;.</p><p>The objects, to form part of the collection at the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, include &quot;monumental sandstone sculptures, refined bronze works, and significant ritual objects&quot;, said a culture ministry statement.</p><p>&quot;These 74 sacred objects are not merely works of art; they are living witnesses to the genius of the Khmer ancestors and the spiritual heart of Khmer civilization,&quot; it added.</p><p>In 2024, New York&#39;s Metropolitan Museum of Art returned 14 artefacts looted by Latchford, including a 10th century sandstone goddess statue and a large 7th century Buddha head.</p><p>Thousands of relics are believed to have been trafficked out of Cambodia over the years.</p><p>Experts say the trade thrived from the mid-1960s to the 1990s -- a period of instability that saw the anti-intellectual Khmer Rouge regime rise to power and left precious heritage unprotected.</p><p>Since 1996 Cambodian law has forbidden the unauthorised removal of antiquities, with a prison punishment of up to eight years.</p><p>Growing numbers of museums and private collections worldwide are facing pressure to repatriate artworks removed from their native countries, particularly those looted during periods of colonial rule.</p><p>suy/jts/fox</p></div></article></div>",
