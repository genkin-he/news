meeting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> less-than-two hour meeting</a> between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.</p><p>The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.</p><p>Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.</p><p>Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said.

It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. The majority are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>&quot;While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>&quot;Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.</p><p>Nexperia, Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>On Oct. 4, China&#39;s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a &quot;war room&quot; to monitor the situation.</p><p>Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p>(Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p></div></article></div>",

class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Canada's premier Mark Carney, a first since 2017 for the two nations' heads (Handout)</figcaption></div></figure><p>China and Canada&#39;s leaders opened on Friday their first formal talks since 2017, with Xi Jinping meeting Prime Minister Mark Carney in South Korea, Chinese state media reported.</p><p>Canada&#39;s relations with China are among the worst of any Western nation but both are at the sharp end of Donald Trump&#39;s tariff onslaught, even after Xi and the US leader&#39;s deal Thursday to dial back tensions.</p><p>Ties fell into a deep freeze in 2018 after the arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive on a US warrant in Vancouver and China&#39;s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges.</p><p>In July, Carney announced an additional 25 percent tariff on steel imports that contain steel melted and poured in China.</p><p>Beijing announced the following month it would impose a painful temporary customs duty of 75.8 percent on Canadian canola imports.</p><p>Canada is among the world&#39;s top producers of canola, an oilseed crop that is used to make cooking oil, animal meal and biodiesel fuel.</p><p>But Canada and China have both been heavily targeted by Trump&#39;s global trade onslaught.</p><p>Trump said on Thursday he would halve fentanyl-related tariffs on China to 10 percent while Xi agreed to keep rare earths flowing and boost imports of US soybeans.</p><p>But the average US tariff on Chinese imports remains at 47 percent, Trump said.</p><p>The US president on Saturday said he was hiking tariffs on Canadian goods by an additional 10 percent and terminated all trade talks.</p><p>This followed what Trump called a &quot;fake&quot; anti-tariff ad campaign that featured the late ex-president Ronald Reagan.</p><p>&quot;(The) old world of steady expansion of rules-based liberalised trade and investment, a world on which so much of our nations&#39; prosperity -- very much Canada&#39;s included -- (is based), that world is gone,&quot; Carney told the APEC gathering.</p><p>- Japan -</p><p>Later Xi was also due later to meet Japan&#39;s first woman premier, Sanae Takaichi, for the first time.</p><p>The regular visitor to the flashpoint Yasukuni shrine honouring Japan&#39;s war dead is seen as a China hawk, although recently she has toned down her remarks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But in her first policy address last Friday, she still declared that the military activities of China -- and North Korea and Russia -- &quot;have become a grave concern&quot;.</p><p>She announced that Japan would be spending two percent of gross domestic product on defence this fiscal year -- two years ahead of schedule.</p><p>China responded by saying that there were &quot;serious doubts among (Japan&#39;s) Asian neighbours and the international community about whether Japan is truly committed to an exclusively defensive posture and the path of peaceful development&quot;.</p><p>On Trump&#39;s visit to Japan on his way to Busan, Takaichi spoke alongside the US leader aboard a US aircraft carrier and said her country faces &quot;unprecedented&quot; security dangers.</p><p>She is also a strong backer of Taiwan and backs security cooperation with the self-ruled island.</p><p>Japanese media said that Takaichi was expected to convey to Xi grave concerns over China&#39;s behaviour, including around the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands by China.</p><p>She was also expected to press for the early release of Japanese citizens detained in China and request that the safety of Japanese expatriates in China be ensured, the reports said.</p><p>Japanese industry is also keen to ensure that supplies of rare earths from China -- which have become a football in Xi&#39;s trade tussle with Trump -- keep flowing.</p><p>&quot;It could be a frosty get-to-know-you meeting as Xi Jinping has not sent a congratulatory message to Takaichi, wary of her reputation as a China hawk,&quot; Yee Kuang Heng, a professor at the University of Tokyo&#39;s Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Overall though, stability is a shared priority and both sides will probably stick to the broad mantra established over the past few years of working towards a &#39;mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests&#39;,&quot; Heng said.</p><p>bur-oho-stu/jm</p></div></article></div>",

heads of Korea&#39;s biggest companies on the sidelines of the APEC summit.</p><p>South Korea is home to two of the world&#39;s leading memory chip makers -- Samsung Electronics and SK hynix -- which manufacture chips essential for artificial intelligence products and the data centres that the fast-evolving industry relies on.</p><p>President Lee has also expressed his hope the country can become a leading AI power.</p><p>Nvidia said it was &quot;working with South Korea to expand the nation&#39;s AI infrastructure with over a quarter-million Nvidia GPUs across its sovereign clouds and AI factories&quot;.</p><p>Under Friday&#39;s deal, 50,000 of the graphics processing units will go towards a new &quot;AI factory&quot; being built by Samsung Electronics.</p><p>&quot;By deploying more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs, AI will be embedded throughout Samsung&#39;s entire manufacturing flow,&quot; the Korean tech giant said.</p><p>SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group will also receive 50,000 chips for use in AI facilities.</p><p>NAVER Cloud -- which operates South Korea&#39;s largest search engine -- will receive 60,000 to expand its AI infrastructure.</p><p>A further 50,000 will be deployed across Seoul&#39;s National AI Computing Center and to cloud service and IT providers.</p><p>&quot;Korea&#39;s leadership in technology and manufacturing positions is at the heart of the AI industrial revolution -- where accelerated computing infrastructure becomes as vital as power grids and broadband,&quot; Nvidia CEO Huang said.</p><p>- Chicken and chips -</p><p>Huang has sought to forge closer ties with South Korean tech giants in his visit to the country this week.</p><p>He met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun on Thursday for

Netflix&#39;s megahit &quot;Squid Game&quot; and meaning &quot;friend&quot; -- was intended to highlight the spirit of friendship underpinning their AI and chip collaborations.</p><p>Nvidia in July became the first company to top $4 trillion in market capitalisation, and followed that up by becoming the first to hit $5 trillion following a company event on Tuesday where it announced new ventures building on its AI technology.</p><p>Its chips drive much of the global AI industry and even featured in talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Gyeongju this week.</p><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power AI systems.</p><p>Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Its chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;We did discuss chips,&quot; Trump said after meeting Xi, adding that Huang would speak to Beijing about the dispute.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re sort of the arbitrator or the referee,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>hs-cdl-oho/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

have hoped for an impromptu talk with his old friend Kim Jong Un during a recent trip to Asia, but analysts say the increasingly emboldened North Korean despot had few good reasons to join the photo-op.</p><p>Trump sent repeated overtures to Kim during his barnstorming tour of Asia, saying he was &quot;100 percent&quot; open to a meeting and even bucking decades of US policy by conceding that North Korea was &quot;sort of a nuclear power&quot;.</p><p>But Pyongyang kept mum on the invitation, instead firing off missiles and sending its foreign minister to Russia and Belarus, with whom it has deepened ties in recent years.</p><p>&quot;The brutal reality is that Kim Jong Un had no incentive to participate,&quot; said Seong-Hyon Lee, a visiting scholar at the Harvard University Asia Center.</p><p>&quot;It was a fundamental miscalculation by Washington to believe he would,&quot; said Lee.</p><p>Trump&#39;s repeated overtures instead represented a &quot;victory&quot; for the North Korean leader -- offering him and his nuclear program a massive degree of credibility, Lee said.</p><p>&quot;President Trump gave Kim a massive, unearned concession,&quot; he explained.</p><p>The pair -- who Trump once famously declared were &quot;in love&quot; -- last met in 2019 at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas after the US leader extended an invitation to Kim on Twitter.</p><p>That overture to Pyongyang spearheaded by Trump eventually collapsed over the scope of denuclearisation of the North and sanctions relief.</p><p>Since then, North Korea has declared itself an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear state and forged close links to Russia, sending troops to support Moscow in its war on Ukraine.</p><p>Kim is now in a &quot;pretty sweet spot&quot;, Soo Kim, a former CIA analyst, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Russia&#39;s backing is probably one of the most decisive factors strengthening and cementing North Korea&#39;s strategic hand these days,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;He maintains the upper hand, which makes it easier for him to pass on Trump&#39;s invitation,&quot; Kim told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Heading home from South Korea and a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Trump said he had been too &quot;busy&quot; to meet Kim, though he added he could return.</p><p>The scene stood in stark contrast to 2019, when denuclearisation and sanctions relief talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, collapsed in dramatic fashion -- leaving Kim to endure a long train journey back to Pyongyang with no deal in hand.</p><p>Vladimir Tikhonov, Korean Studies professor at the University of Oslo, told AFP that experience had left Pyongyang sore.</p><p>&quot;They don&#39;t want to venture forward too rushingly,&quot; he said.</p><p>Instead, Tikhonov said, Pyongyang may be holding out for more specific proposals from Trump, including formal diplomatic recognition and sanctions relief without denuclearisation.</p><p>- Friends like these -</p><p>And closer alliances elsewhere mean Kim has little reason to chase approval from Washington.</p><p>This week, Pyongyang&#39;s foreign minister Choe Son Hui headed to Moscow, where she and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to strengthen bilateral ties.</p><p>Analysts say North Korea is receiving extensive financial aid, military technology, and food and energy assistance from Russia.</p><p>That has allowed it to sidestep tough international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes that were once a crucial bargaining chip for the United States.</p><p>Freeflowing trade with China -- which soared to its highest level in nearly six years last month, according to analysts -- has also helped ease Pyongyang&#39;s economic isolation.</p><p>Last month, Kim appeared alongside Xi Jinping and Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin at an elaborate military parade in Beijing -- a striking display of his new, elevated status in global politics.</p><p>Kim now has &quot;no reason to trade this new, high-status quo for a photo-op&quot; with Trump, said Harvard&#39;s Lee.</p><p>Kim has a &quot;strategic lifeline from Russia and China, and he sees the US-China competition as a long-term guarantee of his own maneuverability.&quot;</p><p>The North Korean leader is now operating from a &quot;position of strength&quot;.</p><p>cdl/oho/cwl</p></div></article></div>",
