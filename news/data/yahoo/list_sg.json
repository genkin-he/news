DESOUKI)</figcaption></div></figure><p>With much pomp and circumstance, Cairo is due to inaugurate on Saturday the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum, widely presented as the crowning jewel on authorities&#39; efforts to overhaul the country&#39;s vital tourism industry.</p><p>With a panoramic view of the Giza pyramids plateau, the GEM houses thousands of artefacts spanning more than 5,000 years of Egyptian antiquity at a whopping cost of over $1 billion.</p><p>More than two decades in the making, the ultra-modern museum anticipates five million visitors annually, with never-before-seen relics on display.</p><p>In the run-up to the grand opening, Egyptian media and official statements have hailed the &quot;historic moment&quot;, describing the museum as &quot;Egypt&#39;s gift to the world&quot; and a &quot;new chapter in the history of Egyptian civilisation&quot;.</p><p>Preparations for the much-delayed inauguration have been shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>Authorities have not named the dignitaries expected to attend, but have promised &quot;kings, princes, heads of state and government leaders&quot;.</p><p>Organisers have also been tight-lipped on the new display for the iconic gold mask of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun.</p><p>Starting Tuesday, the museum will be open to regular visitors who can view 4,500 of about 5,000 funerary objects previously scattered across the country, including at the colonial-era Egyptian Museum in central Cairo.</p><p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday held a high-level meeting &quot;dedicated to advancing preparations&quot; for the inauguration, according to an official statement.</p><p>- &#39;Symbolic dimension&#39; -</p><p>During the meeting, Sisi urged enhanced coordination to ensure the opening ceremony is held &quot;in a manner befitting Egypt&#39;s position, reflecting its leadership in the field of museums and global culture, and contributing to the promotion of tourism in the country&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Emphasis was placed on the symbolic dimension of GEM, which is set to become an international cultural and scientific hub, contributing to enhancing tourism promotion in Egypt,&quot; the statement added.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

civilisation and a global leader in culture and museum innovation&quot;.</p><p>The inauguration had been set for July 3, but was postponed when Israel attacked Iran on June 13, sparking a 12-day war that closed airspace across much of the Middle East.</p><p>Even before that, the project had faced a series of setbacks, including political unrest and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In a bid to reach the widest audience possible, Egyptian state-linked conglomerate United Media Services announced a strategic partnership with TikTok seeking to &quot;share Egypt&#39;s unparallelled civilisational story with audiences across the globe&quot;.</p><p>Following years of instability, Egypt&#39;s tourism industry -- which accounts for about 10 percent of the country&#39;s workforce -- has been recovering.</p><p>In the 2023-2024 fiscal year, tourism revenues stood at $14.4 billion, up 34.6 percent compared to the previous year.</p><p>Around 15 million tourists have visited Egypt in the first nine months of 2025, accounting for $12.5 billion in revenues and marking a 21 percent increase on the same period last year.</p><p>sof/jsa/smw</p></div></article></div>",

He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.</p><p>Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-preparations?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani</a>.

The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>And in a <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters</a> released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%.

Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”</p><h3>Embracing his inner influencer</h3><p>As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.</p><p>Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.</p><p>“It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.</p><p>Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.</p><p>“He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571><noscript><img alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.</p><p>At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.</p><h3>Experience, experience, experience</h3><p>Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.</p><p>Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-police-nypd-defund?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mamdani’s police reform agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mamdani’s police reform agenda</a> would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.</p><p>The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets.

make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,” Mamdani says in the clip, from a Democratic Socialists of America convention held that year. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.</p><p>“We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”</p><p>CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.</p><p>“It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.</p><p>“So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.</p><p>“No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”</p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.</p><p>Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/politics/jessica-tisch-zohran-mamdani-election?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jessica Tisch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Jessica Tisch</a>, though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide.

behalf, to take climate action at home and abroad.&quot;</p><p>She pointed to the work of the 24-state &quot;US Climate Alliance&quot; that have slashed emissions by a quarter relative to 2005 while growing their economies.</p><p>Because the Paris accord requires a one-year notice period for withdrawal, the United States remains a party for a few more months.</p><p>But Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who was also on the call, said it appeared unlikely the administration would send an official delegation to COP, given it had not put in embassy support for the Americans

major powers (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump landed back in Washington Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued just before Trump -- who boasts frequently about being a peace president --&nbsp;went into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>But Trump&#39;s announcement left much unanswered -- chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>It appeared to alarm key US foe Iran, which criticized the directive as &quot;irresponsible.&quot;</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly,&quot; but did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><p>The president&#39;s statement &quot;speaks for itself,&quot; Vance told reporters at the White House.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an important part of American national security to make sure that this nuclear arsenal we have actually functions properly, and that&#39;s part of a testing regime,&quot; he added.</p><p>Trump&#39;s statement nevertheless amounted to unusual nuclear saber rattling.</p><p>It came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>That however appeared to be untrue.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- that China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Nuclear-armed bully&#39; -</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The Trump directive to resume testing appeared to alarm Iran, whose foreign minister called it &quot;regressive and irresponsible,&quot; and a threat to international security.</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations with Russia and China on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>burs-sms-dk/mlm/sla</p></div></article></div>",

Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.</p><h3>Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?</h3><p>Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.</p><p>The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.</p><p>The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.</p><p>As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.</p><p>► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?</p><p>► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line?

One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.</p><p>Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”</p><p>Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”</p><p>The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.</p><p>The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.</p><p>Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue.

After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”</p><p>Republicans face their own risks.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness.
