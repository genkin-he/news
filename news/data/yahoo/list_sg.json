With interest rates for home loans falling to their lowest in three years, and more competitive bank loan packages on the market, mortgage loan refinancing activity in Singapore has ratcheted up.</p><p>Since the start of this year, more Housing Board flat owners in particular have made the switch to bank loans to save money as these have become significantly cheaper, local banks and mortgage brokers told The Straits Times.</p><p>Mr Clive Chng, associate director at Redbrick Mortgage Advisory, said fixed- and floating-rate bank loan packages have dropped to between 1.55 per cent and 1.8 per cent in the past six months. In comparison, the HDB concessionary loan rate is 2.6 per cent.</p><p>Lower interest rates have sparked interest from HDB flat owners who had taken higher fixed-rate bank packages in 2022 and 2023, and reached the end of their loan lock-in periods, said Mr Joel Lim, associate director at Dollarback Mortgage.</p><p>Floating-rate packages are typically pegged to the three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average, or Sora, which banks use to price home loan packages.</p><p>For most of 2023, the Sora rate exceeded 3.6 per cent, but in the past week, it has fallen to below 1.4 per cent. As at Oct 30, the three-month Sora was at around 1.34 per cent per annum – the lowest rate in over three years. This could drop further if the US Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates, local inflation stays low, and the Sing dollar remains strong.</p><p>Mr Lim said the last major refinancing wave occurred between 2019 and 2020, when floating rates fell below 1.5 per cent. At the time, refinancing volumes from HDB loans to bank loans jumped by between 35 per cent and 40 per cent year on year.</p><p>Refinancing activity in 2025, particularly from HDB flat owners, has picked up for OCBC, Ms Maryanne Phua, the bank’s head of home loans, said.</p><p>In the first nine months of the year, the number of HDB home owners switching from an HDB loan to an OCBC home loan grew by over 60 per cent compared with the same period last year, she noted.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“Fixed-rate home loans are the preferred choice — nearly nine in 10 HDB homeowners who&nbsp;refinanced opted for them. This reflects a strong desire for certainty, as fixed rates offer stable monthly repayments that make budgeting easier,” she said.</p><p>At DBS Singapore, Ms Chelsea Ling, head of deposits and secured lending of its consumer banking group, also saw a noticeable increase in demand for POSB HDB home loans. The bank did not quantify what this increase was.</p><p>This&nbsp;three-year fixed-rate loan package offers an interest rate of 1.7 per cent or lower, with no penalty for paying down the POSB HDB home loan or selling one’s property within the lock-in period.</p><p>Refinancing from an HDB loan to the POSB HDB home loan would “translate to an estimated&nbsp;$3,600 in first-year savings&nbsp;on a $400,000 loan – enough to cover a round-trip flight from Singapore to Tokyo for a family of three,” Ms Ling said.</p><p>Banks competing to offer attractive refinancing options means that homeowners are spoilt for choice.</p><p>In addition to lower rates, local banks have been offering cash rebates and legal fee subsidies to lower the costs of refinancing. Some home loan packages now come with flexible loan features, such as a free conversion or free repricing option after the first year, which gives borrowers the flexibility to adapt, should interest rates change course.</p><p>Repricing involves switching to a different interest rate package within the same bank. Banks typically provide free switching to a different interest rate package within the same bank after the lock-in period expires.</p><p>According to Redbrick Mortgage Advisory, the most popular loan packages today include a two-year fixed rate loan at 1.48 per cent with free conversion after the first year, and the three-year fixed rate loan at 1.5 per cent.</p><p>But lower rates have not resulted in a spike in private home refinancing in 2025, according to Mortgage Master.</p><p>Mr David Baey, the mortgage broker’s chief executive, noted that instead of refinancing their current mortgages, some clients have opted to sell their existing private home and buy a new one, and are therefore, taking new loans, as they feel upgrading has become more financially manageable.</p><p>With the three-month Sora expected to hover at between 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent by year-end, the refinancing tailwind could extend into 2026 as home owners continue to take advantage of lower borrowing rates, said Mr Sebastian Sieber, managing director of Cashew Mortgages.</p><p>“That said, the bulk of the rate decline has already occurred. While further declines are possible, they are likely to be modest, given current macroeconomic conditions,” Mr Sieber said.</p><p>Redbrick Mortgage Advisory believes refinancing should remain healthy in 2026, but could moderate from the middle of the year.</p><p>“This is because many borrowers whose loans originated in 2023 and 2024 and had been locked in at 3 per cent to 4 per cent, would have already refinanced at the lower rates,” Mr Chng said.</p><p>“Refinancing from mid-2026 will depend on the prevailing interest rates and the banks’ promotional features and subsidies.”</p><p>Meanwhile, HDB&nbsp;loan refinancing&nbsp;activity is expected to stay steady in 2026, Mr Chng said.</p><p>Some flat owners are cautious about refinancing from HDB loans to bank loans, because once they do so,&nbsp;they cannot switch back to an HDB loan in future. But if interest rates continue to&nbsp;fall, more HDB owners could opt to&nbsp;refinance&nbsp;to bank loans, he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/more-hdb-flat-owners-refinancing-to-cheaper-bank-loans-as-interest-rates-drop-to-3-year-low?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

He listened with great interest.&quot;</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside office hours in Washington.</p><p>Like most countries, the United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is the democratically-governed island&#39;s most important international backer and arms supplier.</p><p>President Donald Trump left South Korea after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the gathering&#39;s summit of leaders began, leaving Bessent to lead the U.S. delegation.</p><p>On Friday night, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi posted a picture on X in which she greeted Lin at the summit.</p><p>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping is one of the few international bodies Taiwan takes part in, although under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;, to avoid political problems with China, which views the island as its own territory.</p><p>Lin did not answer questions on whether he had talked to Xi.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Taiwan&#39;s official Central News Agency said Lin had no interaction with Xi at the closing ceremony&#39;s group photograph for leaders and country representatives, even though both were on the same stage.</p><p>At last year&#39;s summit in Peru, Lin greeted Xi with a wave but they did not speak. Lin also met then-U.S. President Joe Biden in Lima.</p><p>China&#39;s government refuses to speak to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, calling him a &quot;separatist&quot;. China has ramped up military pressure against Taiwan, including war games staged in its vicinity.</p><p>Taiwan&#39;s government rejects Beijing&#39;s sovereignty claims, saying only the island&#39;s people can decide their future.</p><p>(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)</p></div></article></div>",

Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>GYEONGJU, South Korea – The trend towards more global economic fragmentation will likely continue after a “temporary truce” between the US and China, but the rest of the world continues to have agency, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.</p><p>Singapore and other countries are not passive bystanders, he told local media after the conclusion of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit on Nov 1.</p><p>Likening economic fragmentation to global warming, PM Wong said: “We know it’s happening, but we can take actions to mitigate.</p><p>“And likewise, if countries are able to do more like what we did this time with the Apec summit and through other areas of cooperation, if we can all take action together, then we can do something about these structural trends.”</p><p>PM Wong was commenting on the Oct 30 meeting <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/amazing-trump-xi-talks-produce-a-pause-in-us-china-trade-war\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> at the sidelines of Apec which resulted in concessions from both sides on key trade issues such as rare earths and soybeans.</p><p>Describing it as a relief that the meeting took place, PM Wong said some much needed and welcomed guardrails have been placed around the relationship, providing some short-term predictability.</p><p>But their rivalry is likely to continue and fundamental underlying issues have not been resolved, he said.</p><p>In this environment, other economies still have the agency to push frontiers and harmonise standards, PM Wong said.</p><p>He raised the example of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement (Gepa) – a green trade pact which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand had launched negotiations for on the sidelines of the summit.</p><p>Pacts like these have a lot of value because it is easier for like-minded, small trade dependent economies to set new standards and facilitate more economic flows, he said.</p><p>“Then others see it, hopefully others get a little bit of FOMO (fear of missing out), and they say: ‘I want to join in too’,” he said.</p><p>This process is not just theoretical, PM Wong said, raising the example of how Singapore along with Brunei, Chile and New Zealand started the P4 agreement in the past which eventually evolved into <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/6-things-to-know-about-the-trans-pacific-trade-pact-cptpp\"

class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“You see countries applying to join because they see value in it, and we hope to do the same for the Gepa now, with regard to the green economy.”</p><p>More trade and more investments will lead to better jobs for Singaporeans, he said.</p><p>“That’s the tangible benefits from trade, but trade also has a lot of intangible benefits.”</p><p>These include the exchange of ideas and more cultural exchange, which Singaporeans also benefit from, he said.</p><p>Language around trade has changed in recent years, and economic, supply chain and technology security have become increasingly important – meaning more barriers are put up against trade, he said.</p><p>But this year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Wong.</p><p>Following the summit, the leaders of the 21 Apec member economies, including Singapore, issued the Gyeongju Declaration which reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen cooperation and concrete actions to enable economic growth that benefits all.</p><p>This is important for Singapore as it is a trade dependent economy, he added.</p><p>“Trade is not just good to have for us. Trade is our life blood. Trade is existential for us.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288><noscript><img alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Singapore must therefore continue to support Apec and the momentum towards trade and trade liberalisation.</p><p>This means multiple lines of work, including reforming the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and bringing different regional groupings closer together, he said.</p><p>PM Wong spoke about reforming the WTO on Oct 31 at the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM), the highest-level meeting at the annual summit.</p><p>He said then that the collective leadership of Apec’s 21 economies is needed to reform and strengthen the 30-year-old trade body so that it stays effective and relevant.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=c75b6a59-5762-5e25-ac7a-2471240b52e3><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:56% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>Singapore has to be realistic about the challenges of such reforms, PM Wong said.</p><p>“We have to keep pushing at this and do our very best to achieve reforms, even if the trajectory may not always move in a linear fashion.</p><p>“Sometimes it’s up and down, sometimes it may curve and bend, but over a period of time, as long as we are moving forward in the right direction, I think that’s already an achievement.”</p><p>Singapore will continue to do so not just by itself but with like-minded countries, he said.</p><div class=caas-iframely data-embed-anchor=cfaeb542-ae5a-5a35-86db-3053ac5b38ba><a data-iframely-url=https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/8NuZeyY8?app=1 data-lazy data-img></a></div><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/global-fragmentation-still-likely-after-trump-xi-meet-but-countries-can-act-to-mitigate-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

generational prohibition on tobacco, the Health Ministry said.</p><p>The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year -- which came into effect on November 1 -- will &quot;protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation&quot;, the ministry said.</p><p>&quot;Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,&quot; it added.</p><p>&quot;The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.&quot;</p><p>The measure also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.</p><p>The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products, applicable to all individuals regardless of age.</p><p>Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).</p><p>A similar generational ban proposed in Britain is still going through the legislative process, while New Zealand -- the first country to enact such a law against smoking -- repealed it in November 2023, less than a year after it was introduced.</p><p>aj/pjm/fox</p></div></article></div>",

collapse a year ago that triggered mass protests.</p><p>On November 1, 2024, the collapse of the canopy at the newly-renovated railway station in Novi Sad killed 16 people.</p><p>Regular student-led protests have gripped the Balkan nation since the tragedy, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption.</p><p>Protesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.</p><p>Students, who called for the &quot;largest commemorative gathering&quot; on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.</p><p>Thousands marched from Belgrade for some 100 kilometres (62 miles), or even from Novi Pazar, around 340 kilometres south of the capital. It took them 16 days to finish the march.</p><p>Residents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.</p><p>&quot;I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now -- our students, our youth,&quot; said Ratko Popovic from the Novi Sad region.</p><p>The 47-year-old, who arrived with his family, praised the &quot;unity of all the people in Serbia who are against corruption, against crime, against the ruling party&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Conscience guides us&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Our conscience is what guides us, it&#39;s what makes us act in this way, to finally bring justice and a better tomorrow to this country,&quot; Luka Kovacevic, medical student from Novi Sad, told AFP.</p><p>The protests have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the collapse of his government and formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.</p><p>Vucic regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party push conspiracy theories claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.</p><p>&quot;This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.</p><p>The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth. The leaders also adopted an AI initiative and a framework to respond to demographic changes caused by low birth rates and aging populations.</p><p>“The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum in his opening remarks Friday. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”</p><p>“China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.</p><p>Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.</p><p>In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”</p><p>Lee will sit down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. On the agenda are discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and regional peace and stability.</p><p>Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.</p><p>North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.</p><p>Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.</p><p>Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>“I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.</p><p>Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/14/economy/japan-economy-recession-hnk-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:mounting economic woes.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">mounting economic woes.</a></p><p>She told reporters after the meeting that China and Japan agreed to build a “strategic mutually beneficial relationship.” But Takaichi said she also expressed concerns to Xi on sensitive issues including Chinese export controls on rare earths, China’s activity in the East China Sea, and the detention of Japanese nationals in China.</p><p>“I also asked China to resume Japanese beef and seafood imports,” she said.</p><p>The meeting appeared in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warm camaraderie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warm camaraderie</a> showed by Takaichi and Trump in Tokyo just days before, when the two allies had embarked on a “new golden age” of relations. Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.</p><p>For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.</p><p>In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”</p><p>“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p><p>Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/04/americas/canada-china-michael-chong-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic rows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic rows</a>.

Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>GYEONGJU, South Korea – As artificial intelligence evolves, governments must invest more in preparing their workers and cannot leave it to the market, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) economies can lead these efforts by reskilling and upskilling workers, redesigning jobs, and building trust in AI, so they are not caught on the backfoot, PM Wong said on Nov 1.</p><p>“By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies around the Pacific Rim which make up the grouping.</p><p>Singapore’s focus is on the application and use of AI, he said.</p><p>As a small, compact and digitally connected city-state, it cannot on its own develop leading-edge AI foundation models. But it can use them to develop and make applications with the “biggest impact” in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing, PM Wong said.</p><p>Singapore cannot do this work alone, and is keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other Apec economies, he added.</p><p>In a session themed “Preparing for a future-ready Asia-Pacific”, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.</p><p>“It will uplift productivity, and transform the way we work and live,” he added as he laid out ways to spearhead cooperation in harnessing the technology.</p><p>AI is already transforming industries in Singapore, he said on the second day of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM), the highest-level meeting at the annual summit which is running from Oct 31 to Nov 1 in Gyeongju, South Korea.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 827px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"In a session themed “Preparing for a future-ready Asia-Pacific”, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YqLWmWpCyO280AVcORF0Hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjc-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c668113610a2a48df54b3fc419fb0197><noscript><img alt=\"In a session themed “Preparing for a future-ready Asia-Pacific”, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YqLWmWpCyO280AVcORF0Hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjc-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c668113610a2a48df54b3fc419fb0197 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>In a session themed “Preparing for a future-ready Asia-Pacific”, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Outlining what needs to be done to unlock the technology’s potential, PM Wong said Apec economies must build up the capabilities of their workforces and prepare workers.</p><p>With every new wave of technology, some jobs will disappear and new jobs will be created, and historically, the net impact has been positive – meaning more net jobs have been created.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But there is no economic law that guarantees this will automatically happen, PM Wong said.</p><p>“Just because it happened in the past doesn’t mean it will also happen in the future. We cannot leave this to the market.”</p><p>Apec economies also need to build trust in AI, he said.</p><p>That is why Singapore is playing an active role in global efforts to advance AI standards – so that there is an overall framework for innovation and users know that they are using responsibly-developed systems. he added.</p><p>To do so, Singapore has set up the AI Verify Foundation to set such standards in partnership with the private sector, which now has over 170 members including firms like Hitachi, Google and OpenAI, he noted.</p><p>The foundation was set up in 2023 to boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators globally.</p><p>Earlier in 2025, Singapore also convened leading experts to formulate the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities, a document aligning views on the development, assessment, and control of AI, he noted.</p><p>PM Wong also urged Apec economies to keep data corridors open, because data is what powers AI models.</p><p>Singapore supports the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules, which facilitate the free flow of data with trust, in order to promote AI innovation. he said.</p><p>Trade pacts like <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-chile-and-new-zealand-launch-negotiations-for-a-new-green-trade-pact\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement</a> – which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand signed in 2020 – can also enable data flows.</p><p>On how Apec can take the lead on these efforts, PM Wong said the member economies have AI expertise and experience.</p><p>He commended this year’s Apec summit host South Korea for convening the first Apec Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting.</p><p>The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said. It will promote greater cooperation on AI through policy exchanges and capacity-building projects, and foster investments in AI infrastructure.</p><p>“Singapore looks forward to working with Apec economies to ensure that our societies benefit from AI,” he said. “Together, we can put AI to work on the problems that matter most, so our people can prosper together.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-wong-to-attend-apec-launch-strategic-partnership-in-south-korea\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:PM Wong is in Gyeongju for the Apec meet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">PM Wong is in Gyeongju for the Apec meet</a> till Nov 1.
