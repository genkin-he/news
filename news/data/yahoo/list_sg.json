Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>GYEONGJU, South Korea – The trend towards more global economic fragmentation will likely continue after a “temporary truce” between the US and China, but the rest of the world continues to have agency, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.</p><p>Singapore and other countries are not passive bystanders, he told local media after the conclusion of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit on Nov 1.</p><p>Likening economic fragmentation to global warming, PM Wong said: “We know it’s happening, but we can take actions to mitigate.</p><p>“And likewise, if countries are able to do more like what we did this time with the Apec summit and through other areas of cooperation, if we can all take action together, then we can do something about these structural trends.”</p><p>PM Wong was commenting on the Oct 30 meeting <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/amazing-trump-xi-talks-produce-a-pause-in-us-china-trade-war\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> at the sidelines of Apec which resulted in concessions from both sides on key trade issues such as rare earths and soybeans.</p><p>Describing it as a relief that the meeting took place, PM Wong said some much needed and welcomed guardrails have been placed around the relationship, providing some short-term predictability.</p><p>But their rivalry is likely to continue and fundamental underlying issues have not been resolved, he said.</p><p>In this environment, other economies still have the agency to push frontiers and harmonise standards, PM Wong said.</p><p>He raised the example of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement (Gepa) – a green trade pact which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand had launched negotiations for on the sidelines of the summit.</p><p>Pacts like these have a lot of value because it is easier for like-minded, small trade dependent economies to set new standards and facilitate more economic flows, he said.</p><p>“Then others see it, hopefully others get a little bit of FOMO (fear of missing out), and they say: ‘I want to join in too’,” he said.</p><p>This process is not just theoretical, PM Wong said, raising the example of how Singapore along with Brunei, Chile and New Zealand started the P4 agreement in the past which eventually evolved into <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/6-things-to-know-about-the-trans-pacific-trade-pact-cptpp\"

class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“You see countries applying to join because they see value in it, and we hope to do the same for the Gepa now, with regard to the green economy.”</p><p>More trade and more investments will lead to better jobs for Singaporeans, he said.</p><p>“That’s the tangible benefits from trade, but trade also has a lot of intangible benefits.”</p><p>These include the exchange of ideas and more cultural exchange, which Singaporeans also benefit from, he said.</p><p>Language around trade has changed in recent years, and economic, supply chain and technology security have become increasingly important – meaning more barriers are put up against trade, he said.</p><p>But this year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Wong.</p><p>Following the summit, the leaders of the 21 Apec member economies, including Singapore, issued the Gyeongju Declaration which reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen cooperation and concrete actions to enable economic growth that benefits all.</p><p>This is important for Singapore as it is a trade dependent economy, he added.</p><p>“Trade is not just good to have for us. Trade is our life blood. Trade is existential for us.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288><noscript><img alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Singapore must therefore continue to support Apec and the momentum towards trade and trade liberalisation.</p><p>This means multiple lines of work, including reforming the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and bringing different regional groupings closer together, he said.</p><p>PM Wong spoke about reforming the WTO on Oct 31 at the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM), the highest-level meeting at the annual summit.</p><p>He said then that the collective leadership of Apec’s 21 economies is needed to reform and strengthen the 30-year-old trade body so that it stays effective and relevant.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=c75b6a59-5762-5e25-ac7a-2471240b52e3><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:56% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>Singapore has to be realistic about the challenges of such reforms, PM Wong said.</p><p>“We have to keep pushing at this and do our very best to achieve reforms, even if the trajectory may not always move in a linear fashion.</p><p>“Sometimes it’s up and down, sometimes it may curve and bend, but over a period of time, as long as we are moving forward in the right direction, I think that’s already an achievement.”</p><p>Singapore will continue to do so not just by itself but with like-minded countries, he said.</p><div class=caas-iframely data-embed-anchor=cfaeb542-ae5a-5a35-86db-3053ac5b38ba><a data-iframely-url=https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/8NuZeyY8?app=1 data-lazy data-img></a></div><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/global-fragmentation-still-likely-after-trump-xi-meet-but-countries-can-act-to-mitigate-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

generational prohibition on tobacco, the Health Ministry said.</p><p>The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year -- which came into effect on November 1 -- will &quot;protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation&quot;, the ministry said.</p><p>&quot;Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,&quot; it added.</p><p>&quot;The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.&quot;</p><p>The measure also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.</p><p>The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products, applicable to all individuals regardless of age.</p><p>Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).</p><p>A similar generational ban proposed in Britain is still going through the legislative process, while New Zealand -- the first country to enact such a law against smoking -- repealed it in November 2023, less than a year after it was introduced.</p><p>aj/pjm/fox</p></div></article></div>",

protests have gripped the Balkan nation since the tragedy, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption.</p><p>Protesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.</p><p>Students, who called for the &quot;largest commemorative gathering&quot; on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.</p><p>Thousands marched from Belgrade for some 100 kilometres (62 miles), or even from Novi Pazar, around 340 kilometres south of the capital. It took them 16 days to finish the march.</p><p>Residents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.</p><p>&quot;I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now -- our students, our youth,&quot; said Ratko Popovic from the Novi Sad region.</p><p>The 47-year-old, who arrived with his family, praised the &quot;unity of all the people in Serbia who are against corruption, against crime, against the ruling party&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Conscience guides us&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Our conscience is what guides us, it&#39;s what makes us act in this way, to finally bring justice and a better tomorrow to this country,&quot; Luka Kovacevic, medical student from Novi Sad, told AFP.</p><p>The protests have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the collapse of his government and formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.</p><p>Vucic regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party push conspiracy theories claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.</p><p>&quot;This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed. I apologise for that&quot;, Vucic said and called for a dialogue.</p><p>Saturday&#39;s commemorative rally at the Novi Sad railway station will start at 11:52 am (1052 GMT), the time when the tragedy occurred, with 16 minutes of silence observed for 16 victims.</p><p>The government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning while head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) Patriarch Porfirije is to serve a mass for the victims at the Belgrade Saint Sava church.</p><p>Vucic supporters, camping outside the parliament for months against the university blockades in support of the government, said they would gather in front of the church to pay respect to the victims.</p><p>&quot;On this sad anniversary, we appeal to everyone ... to act with restraint, to deescalate tensions and to avoid violence&quot;, the European Union delegation in Serbia said in a statement.</p><p>The protests have remained largely peaceful but in mid-August they degenerated into violence that protesters blamed on heavy-handed tactics by government loyalists and police.</p><p>In September, 13 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic were charged in a criminal case over the collapse.</p><p>A separate anti-corruption probe continues alongside an EU-backed investigation into the possible misuse of EU funds in the project. </p><p>oz-al-ljv/ach</p></div></article></div>",

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stood in for Trump during the discussions.</p><p>The grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific signed the “Gyeongju Declaration,” which included commitments to cooperate on economic recovery and growth.

But a major focus for the forum this year was on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.</p><p>In their declaration, the leaders acknowledged that “the global trading system continues to face significant challenges,” and as su ch they would “support efforts to ensure resilient supply chains” and “create new drivers of growth” through digital innovations, including AI.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6FDEfowlYB6yz.hbZ1QOjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4bd512396a845bc25953f713c8690282 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their talks in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025 in this photo distributed by Kyodo. - Kyodo/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “Only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”</p><p>Lee will sit down for talks with Xi, who is on a state visit to South Korea, in the first summit meeting between the two leaders. On the agenda are discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and regional peace and stability.</p><p>Ahead of the talks, Lee said the relationship between Seoul and Beijing has “not completely recovered yet” and there was a need to “find the path for helping one another.” He looked forward to China playing a role in promoting peace on the peninsula, Lee said.</p><p>North Korea called talk of denuclearization a “pipedream” that will never be realized. The country’s Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho accused South Korea of lacking “common sense” for refusing to acknowledge Pyongyang as a nuclear-armed state, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported Saturday.</p><p>Among the high-profile meetings Xi had on the sidelines of APEC was with Japan’s newly installed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.</p><p>Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>“I aim to maintain communication with you and therefore jointly promote the development of China-Japan relations along the right track,” Xi said.</p><p>Takaichi faced a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi.

Takaichi and Trump demonstrated a close bond complete with smiles, fist pumps and jokes.</p><p>For Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, meeting with Xi marked a “turning point” in their relationship, according to his office.</p><p>In an earlier speech that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”</p><p>“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p><p>Carney had been looking for a reset of Canada-China relations after years of worsening ties and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/04/americas/canada-china-michael-chong-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic rows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic rows</a>.

not caught on the backfoot, PM Wong said on Nov 1.</p><p>“By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies around the Pacific Rim which make up the grouping.</p><p>Singapore’s focus is on the application and use of AI, he said.</p><p>As

Assets Control over his alleged links to Cambodian national Chen Zhi and the Prince Holding Group.</p><p>US investigators alleged that Fujian-born Chen, who is at large, ran a multinational conglomerate that was one of Asia’s largest transnational crime organisations.</p><p>Figures from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) showed that in 2024, close to half of the inmate population were aged 39 and younger. The largest age group was between 30 and 39.</p><p>More young people have also been locked up in Changi Prison for their involvement in secret society activities, under a law that allows detention without trial.</p><p>According to SPS’ records, 65 individuals aged 29 or younger were in detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) as at Dec 31, 2024.</p><p>The group accounted for more than half the total CLTPA detainee population.</p><p>While a 2024 report by the Ministry of Social and Family Development showed that Singapore’s youth offending rate has remained low at an average of 5.2 per 1,000&nbsp;youth&nbsp;from 2019 to 2023, there were spikes in several areas including offences under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (from 92 to 133 offenders).</p><p>Offences under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act involved mainly youth who were seen with offensive weapons such as knives.</p><p>Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz, director and head of criminal defence at Silvester&nbsp;Legal, said he has handled more young offenders implicated in serious crimes including money laundering since 2018.</p><p>He said some of these offenders may not be fully aware that transferring funds as money mules may constitute an offence under various anti-money laundering legislation.</p><p>“Some of them think that because of their age, they will only be slapped on the wrist if caught. They have been enticed by quick cash offers on social media platforms and are not looking to get rich.</p><p>“Instead, they often use the money they earn to pay fees or help their parents,” said Mr Siraj.</p><p>He added that these young offenders think the crimes they are involved in are victimless.</p><p>“They need to be educated on the implications of their activities, and the consequences of their actions,” he said, adding that offenders who commit serious crimes to get rich are the outliers.</p><p>The first person to be convicted under the Organised Crime Act, which was passed in 2015 and took effect in June 2016, was Singaporean Or Poh Soon.</p><p>Or, then 55, was sentenced to two years’ jail and a fine of $50,000 for his role in an illegal remote gambling syndicate which ran more than five 4-D and Toto websites.</p><p>The 49-member scam syndicate busted in Cambodia warrants a closer look at not only the penalties for serious crimes, but what more can be done to educate young Singaporeans of the grave consequences when they get entangled in criminal activities.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/49FMXxxF_o2j21o5pw16lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/95a1209cf72773791306e9d5058cd6e5><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/49FMXxxF_o2j21o5pw16lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/95a1209cf72773791306e9d5058cd6e5 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-needs-to-be-done-to-educate-young-of-grave-consequences-of-criminal-activities?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
