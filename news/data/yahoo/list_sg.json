conglomerate that was one of Asia’s largest transnational crime organisations.</p><p>Figures from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) showed that in 2024, close to half of the inmate population were aged 39 and younger. The largest age group was between 30 and 39.</p><p>More young people have also been locked up in Changi Prison for their involvement in secret society activities, under a law that allows detention without trial.</p><p>According to SPS’ records, 65 individuals aged 29 or younger were in detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) as at Dec 31, 2024.</p><p>The group accounted for more than half the total CLTPA detainee population.</p><p>While a 2024 report by the Ministry of Social and Family Development showed that Singapore’s youth offending rate has remained low at an average of 5.2 per 1,000&nbsp;youth&nbsp;from 2019 to 2023, there were spikes in several areas including offences under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (from 92 to 133 offenders).</p><p>Offences under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act involved mainly youth who were seen with offensive weapons such as knives.</p><p>Mr Siraj Shaik Aziz, director and head of criminal defence at Silvester&nbsp;Legal, said he has handled more young offenders implicated in serious crimes including money laundering since 2018.</p><p>He said some of these offenders may not be fully aware that transferring funds as money mules may constitute an offence under various anti-money laundering legislation.</p><p>“Some of them think that because of their age, they will only be slapped on the wrist if caught. They have been enticed by quick cash offers on social media platforms and are not looking to get rich.</p><p>“Instead, they often use the money they earn to pay fees or help their parents,” said Mr Siraj.</p><p>He added that these young offenders think the crimes they are involved in are victimless.</p><p>“They need to be educated on the implications of their activities, and the consequences of their actions,” he said, adding that offenders who commit serious crimes to get rich are the outliers.</p><p>The first person to be convicted under the Organised Crime Act, which was passed in 2015 and took effect in June 2016, was Singaporean Or Poh Soon.</p><p>Or, then 55, was sentenced to two years’ jail and a fine of $50,000 for his role in an illegal remote gambling syndicate which ran more than five 4-D and Toto websites.</p><p>The 49-member scam syndicate busted in Cambodia warrants a closer look at not only the penalties for serious crimes, but what more can be done to educate young Singaporeans of the grave consequences when they get entangled in criminal activities.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/49FMXxxF_o2j21o5pw16lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/95a1209cf72773791306e9d5058cd6e5><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/49FMXxxF_o2j21o5pw16lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/95a1209cf72773791306e9d5058cd6e5 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-needs-to-be-done-to-educate-young-of-grave-consequences-of-criminal-activities?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

The 20-point plan calls for a multinational force to stabilize the battered enclave, but potential participants say critical details about its mandate are still not finalized.</p><p>Trump announced his plan to end the war in Gaza on September 29, saying the International Stabilization Force (ISF) was expected to deploy “immediately” to train Palestinian police, secure borders with Israel and Egypt, block munition inflows and enable further withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.</p><p>The first phase of the ceasefire involved the release of hostages from Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israel. The second phase of Trump’s plan requires the formation of the ISF. While US officials have floated several possible contributors, and some nations have expressed interest, none have formally announced participation.</p><p>Potential participants are seeking clarity and assurances before committing troops to Gaza, which is now facing armed militias, criminal gangs, and the threat of Israeli strikes with no sign of Hamas disarming. The force would be an unprecedented multinational effort to stabilize the territory that had been controlled by Hamas since 2007.</p><p>A Middle East official familiar with the plans told CNN that nations expected to take part in the mission are still in discussion with the US over key issues including the size of the force, the number of personnel each nation will contribute, the chain-of-command, who would lead decision-making, and the duration of deployment of the force.</p><p>Israel has voiced concern over participants in the force, saying it will not tolerate the involvement of nations it views as antagonistic, like Turkey, which played a crucial role in getting Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.</p><p>“These matters of composition, lack of clarity around the specifics of, for example, the disarmament mandate, and the uncertainties around what interaction and coordination will inevitably entail with the Israel Defense Forces, undoubtedly raise challenges for launching,” Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The regional official told CNN that some potential participating nations have insisted that the force only be transitional, with a capped timeline until an “empowered” Palestinian Authority can fully assume control in Gaza.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, speaks next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister&#39;s Office in Jerusalem, on October 23. - Ronen Zvulun/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1bBKN4BK2M.2QjiNgkhdPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/70b8e8e2bd7dc749104240682b662db2><noscript><img alt=\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, speaks next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister&#39;s Office in Jerusalem, on October 23. - Ronen Zvulun/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1bBKN4BK2M.2QjiNgkhdPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/70b8e8e2bd7dc749104240682b662db2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, left, speaks next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, on October 23. - Ronen Zvulun/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Countries are also requesting an international mandate that would formalize the ISF’s legitimacy, the regional official said, adding that some potential participants have demanded a United Nations Security Council resolution. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested during a visit to Jerusalem last week that a mandate could also come through an international agreement.</p><p>“We’re working on some language on that now that hopefully will be in place… we will need something… because some of these countries by their own laws can’t participate in these efforts unless they have some sort of international mandate or flag that they’re under,” Rubio said in Jerusalem.</p><h3>‘Running around Gaza on patrol with weapons’</h3><p>Jordan’s King Abdullah II told the BBC in an interview this week that the mandate is needed to determine whether the ISF will be “peacekeeping” or “peace enforcing” force, warning that countries would not like to be “running around Gaza on patrol with weapons” in a “peace enforcing” capacity.</p><p>“What is the mandate of security forces inside of Gaza? And we hope that it is peacekeeping, because if it’s peace-enforcing, nobody will want to touch that,” he warned.</p><p>Other issues include how heavily armed the troops would be, how the force would interact with the Israeli military and whether it would be prepared to get involved if internal clashes break out in the enclave.</p><p>US officials have cited several countries as potential participants, including Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Pakistan has also said it could be part of the force.</p><p>Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel will determine which international forces it deems acceptable to enter Gaza after the war.</p><p>Vance addressed questions about Turkish involvement in Gaza during a press conference in Israel last week and said any foreign troops that will be stationed in Gaza will require Israel’s explicit consent.</p><p>“What troops are on the ground in Israel – and Gaza – is going to be a question the Israelis have to agree to,” he said, praising Turkey’s “very constructive” role in facilitating the ceasefire.</p><p>Netanyahu’s office said Israel is dedicated to the plan, and welcomes “a responsible and potent ISF” which it described “as a key element towards reaching the goal of all those wishing to usher in a new era of stability for the Strip,”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

island&#39;s biggest opposition party told AFP, which could derail the government&#39;s spending plans.</p><p>The Kuomintang party (KMT) controls parliament -- and the government&#39;s purse strings -- with the help of the Taiwan People&#39;s Party, and has close ties with China.</p><p>Taiwan president Lai Ching-te, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), aims to boost defence spending to more than three percent of GDP next year and five percent by 2030, following US pressure to spend more on protecting itself against a potential Chinese attack.</p><p>China claims Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring the island under its control.</p><p>&quot;The US&#39; expectations far exceed what we can reasonably afford,&quot; Cheng Li-wun, 55, told AFP in

Last December, she reported being <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/politics/nancy-mace-says-she-was-physically-accosted?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:“physically accosted”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">“physically accosted”</a> on Capitol grounds.</p><p>One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”</p><p>CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/nancy-mace-airport-police-security.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:told The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">told The New York Times</a>, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”</p><p>“We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito told the Times. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”</p><p>Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.</p><h3>Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle</h3><p>Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.</p><p>At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.</p><p>A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.</p><p>When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”</p><p>“She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”</p><p>A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.</p><p>Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Landed home prices on the island also dropped – by about 13.1 per cent, from $2,210 psf in 2023 to $1,842 psf in 2025, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) figures showed.</p><p>In comparison, overall median prices of resale condominium units in the Core Central Region (CCR) on the mainland rose from $2,081 psf in 2023 to $2,111 psf in 2024 and $2,186 psf from January to September 2025.</p><p>The URA’s release on Oct 24 showed that the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hdb-resale-price-growth-in-q3-near-5-year-low-private-home-prices-driven-by-new-launches\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:overall private residential property price index rose 0.9 per cent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">overall private residential property price index rose 0.9 per cent</a> from the second to the third quarter of 2025. Prices of landed properties increased by 1.4 per cent, while those of non-landed homes rose by 0.8 per cent.</p><p>The outlier performance underscores how the waterfront enclave, which has 2,160 private homes, remains driven by a niche, lifestyle-oriented buyer pool, said property analysts.</p><p>Asked why Sentosa Cove prices diverged from the mainland’s, property analysts pointed to the absence of new projects to set pricing benchmarks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>ERA Singapore’s key executive officer, Mr Eugene Lim, said the lack of fresh launches in Sentosa Cove has left the resale market without reference points, noting that the last Sentosa residential plot was sold in 2008.</p><p>“In contrast, mainland Singapore continues to see a steady stream of new sites through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme, which has helped support residential price growth amid rising land costs,” said Mr Lim.</p><p>He added that “a smaller supply of homes on Sentosa also meant that transaction volume is lower compared with the mainland”, reinforcing softer pricing.</p><p>Figures from URA show that sales volume islandwide rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2025 as developers ramped up launches to 4,191 private residential units, excluding executive condominiums. Developers sold 3,288 units islandwide from July to September, and 4,116 private residential units also changed hands in the resale market.</p><p>Currently, all transactions on Sentosa are resale units, and resale prices usually do not move as fast as new properties, noted Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist of property firm Realion (OrangeTee &amp; ETC) Group.</p><p>Demand is another factor, and foreign buyers traditionally play a significant role in supporting the Sentosa property market, she said.</p><p>Since the hike in additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) to 60 per cent in April 2023, “there has been a noticeable drop in the number of private homes bought by foreigners, which may have impacted properties in Sentosa Cove more than other areas”, added Ms Sun.</p><p>Citing URA caveats, she highlighted that the median price of resale condominium units in Sentosa Cove was also higher, at above $3 million in both 2024 and 2025, compared with the $1.6 million to $1.7 million islandwide.</p><p>Sentosa’s higher price quantum also narrows the buyer pool, while the relative lack of schools and everyday amenities make the location less compelling for many local families, said Ms Sun.</p><p>Sentosa Cove, which began as a residential zone in 2006, is the only enclave where foreigners can buy landed property, subject to approval.</p><p>Foreign buyers reportedly snapped up landed homes between 2009 and 2011, which led to a spike in prices. The median price psf for non-landed properties in Sentosa Cove rose to $2,110 in 2011.</p><p>In 2012, SC Global Developments’ Seven Palms set a record of $4,200 psf for a 99-year leasehold development when Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart paid $57 million for two units.</p><p>However, after the ABSD was introduced in December 2011 – applying to foreigners buying any residential property and Singaporeans buying their third and subsequent properties – to moderate demand for homes, the median price psf fell below $2,000 in 2012.</p><p>For almost the next decade, it hovered around $1,500 psf and $1,600 psf.</p><p>But the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a turnaround for Sentosa Cove homes. Prices for non-landed homes there started rising in 2021, hitting a median of $2,125 psf in 2023, supported by the sale at Cape Royale.</p><p>The upscale development, completed in 2013, hit the market only in 2022, nine years after the project was completed. The units were sold at between $2,000 psf and $2,300 psf. The developer held back units after sale prices fell following two rounds of property cooling measures in 2013.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 1207px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:97%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2wYGrWSq49HEb6wjsxOI3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjA3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c274a076c1663f0643787f36482bc507><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2wYGrWSq49HEb6wjsxOI3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjA3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c274a076c1663f0643787f36482bc507 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>With Cape Royale excluded, URA data shows the median psf price for a resale 99-year leasehold condo unit in Sentosa Cove to be $1,577.</p><p>In April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/prices-of-unsold-units-at-the-residences-at-w-singapore-sentosa-cove-slashed-by-nearly-half?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unsold units at The Residences at W Singapore Sentosa Cove were relaunched for sale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unsold units at The Residences at W Singapore Sentosa Cove were relaunched for sale</a> at more than 40 per cent off their initial 2010 launch price, with prices starting from $1,648 psf.</p><p>Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, head of research and data analytics at real estate agency Singapore Realtors, said the adjusted price points could <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/waterfront-dream-sentosa-cove-condo-prices-hit-1648-psf-is-it-too-good-to-miss\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:open a window for buyers who had been waiting to enter the enclave.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">open a window for buyers who had been waiting to enter the enclave.</a></p><p>Mr Lim said set against CCR prices on the mainland, Sentosa offers relative value for buyers who prioritise waterfront living and space over connectivity and convenience.</p><p>Ms Sun said that in the longer term, limited stock on Sentosa may continue to appeal to investors looking for properties that are exclusive and rare.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sentosa-cove-property-prices-buck-mainland-uptrend-as-loss-making-deals-rise?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

the world&#39;s two largest economies.</p><p>Anxiety over chip shortages began when Dutch officials invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government.</p><p>China in response banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s Chinese CEO.</p><p>&quot;We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,&quot; a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his American counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels the same day, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial, as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>The chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components as well as consumer and mobile electronics like refrigerators.</p><p>The company makes them in Europe before sending them to China for finishing and then re-exporting them back to European clients.</p><p>- Automaker anxiety -</p><p>European carmakers and parts suppliers had warned of chip shortages supplied by Nexperia that would force stoppages at production lines in Europe.</p><p>The chipmaker supplies 49 percent of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry, according to German financial daily Handelsblatt.</p><p>The European auto lobby ACEA warned last month that production would be seriously hit.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,&quot; the group said.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s chips, while widely used, are not &quot;unique&quot; in terms of technology and therefore &quot;easily substitutable&quot;, French parts maker OPmobility said.</p><p>But suppliers must get the new
