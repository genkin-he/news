She loved pretty much everyone she met, and was late for pretty much everything.</p><p>“She had this way of making you feel special and loved that I didn’t even understand that until we lost her,” Donna Ganger said Friday of her daughter, who was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/us/ice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:shot and killed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">shot and killed</a> by an immigration officer during the federal crackdown in Minneapolis.</p><p>She was “slow to anger, quick to love, quick to care,” said her father, Tim Ganger. “That’s the essence of who she was.”</p><p>Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was killed Jan. 7 as immigration agents surged through the Minneapolis area, sparking waves of protests. Her death and that of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/us/shooting-minneapolis-alex-pretti-killed?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:another U.S. citizen, Alex Pretti;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">another U.S. citizen, Alex Pretti</a>, just weeks later sparked outrage across the country and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-minneapolis-shooting-funding-democrats-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:calls to rein in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">calls to rein in</a> immigration enforcement.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview in Colorado, where some of the family lives, Good’s parents and two of her brothers, Brent and Luke Ganger, talked to the AP about the joy Good found in life, their grief at losing her and their hopes that her death can bring some sort of change in a deeply polarized nation.</p><p>“It’s going to be hard in the future,” Donna Ganger said. “It’s going to be kind of a constant pain.”</p><h3>Settling in Minneapolis</h3><p>Good, who graduated from college later in life, was volunteering in a local school district and working as a substitute teacher when she was killed, her parents said.</p><p>“She was working so hard to get her education, and then she was finally able to use it, and I could just tell how happy she was and how fulfilled,” Donna Ganger said.</p><p>Good, her 6-year-old son and her partner Becca Good — the women were not legally married, according to a family lawyer, but referred to one another as wives — had only recently relocated to Minneapolis from Kansas City, Missouri, settling in a quiet residential street in a tight-knit neighborhood known for its progressive activism.</p><p>In social media accounts, Renee Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom.” On Pinterest, a profile picture shows her smiling and holding a young child, alongside posts about tattoos, hairstyles and home decorating.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The family “settled very quickly into the community in Minneapolis,” said Donna Ganger, describing how the neighborhood had also welcomed the rest of the family when they came after the shooting. They see that as the result of the love that Good had showed her new neighbors.</p><p>“It was incredible to receive that back,” Luke Ganger said.</p><p>Donna Ganger held a stuffed, toy owl as she spoke, a gift from her daughter, who knew how much she loved the birds. It had sparkles on its feet, a reminder of Good’s love for glitter.</p><p>At Good’s memorial service, a table of glitter had been set out for guests. Donna Ganger had put a piece on a lens of her glasses and it’s remained there.</p><p>“She just kind of sparkled all the way through,” said Donna Ganger. “I think of her and I look down and see my little sparkle.”</p><h3>An American blend</h3><p>The family is “a very American blend,” Luke Ganger said recently in testimony to Congress. “We vote differently, and we rarely completely agree on the finer details of what it means to be a citizen of this country.”</p><p>Yet “we have always treated each other with love and respect,” he said.</p><p>On Friday, the family didn’t want to discuss the specifics of their differences, but Donna Ganger said she’d long prayed for guidance: “Before all this happened I said ‘Make me a wise woman.’”</p><p>In the hours after Good’s death, Trump administration officials said she had been shot as she tried to drive her car into an immigration officer. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had committed “an act of domestic terrorism.”</p><p>But as details of the confrontation emerged, and criticism of the crackdown began growing, administration comments softened.</p><p>President Donald Trump said he’d been told that Tim Ganger had supported him.</p><p>“He was all for Trump, loved Trump. And, you know, it’s terrible,” he told reporters. “I hope he still feels that way.”</p><p>Tim Ganger declined to talk about his political affiliation or whether it had changed with his daughter’s killing.</p><p>“I think I’m just going to leave that go,” he said. “There’s so many other important things,” to deal with now.</p><p>But family members said they hoped their ability to get along would be an inspiration.</p><p>“Our purpose through this whole tragic, difficult, unbelievable time, is to have something good come out of this,” Tim Ganger said. “Otherwise the senselessness of this is overwhelming.”</p><p>Sadness echoed in Donna Ganger’s voice as she talked about navigating family differences.</p><p>“Sometimes I’m just silly, you know, and I joke with them and I’m goofy,” she said. “But I want to be able to talk about hard things — and that’s hard sometimes with your own family to talk about hard things that maybe you don’t agree on. And I don’t want there to be any hardships between us or hurt.”</p><p>“But it’s important that we learn to be careful with our words, but share them in a deep way,” she said. “It’s really important.”</p><p>Family members only spoke in general ways about the change they’d like to see come from Good’s death.</p><p>“I think it’s evident that something is broken, right?” said Brent Ganger. “And when something is broken, you have to take a deep look to see what it is that can be changed and fixed in order for it to not happen again.”</p><h3>The morning of the shooting</h3><p>On the morning of the shooting, as immigration raids and protests were flaring across the city, Becca Good has said they stopped their car in the street to support neighbors during an immigration operation.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/17/us/ice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Video shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Video shows</a> Renee Good in a red SUV blocking part of the road and repeatedly honking her horn.</p><p>Two immigration officers get out of a truck and one orders Good to open her door. She reverses briefly, then turns the steering wheel as the officer says again, “get out of the car.” Almost simultaneously, Becca Good, standing in the street shouts, “drive, baby, drive!”</p><p>When Good begins pulling forward, an ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and fires at least two shots into the car, killing Good.</p><p>Weeks later, Tim Ganger said he hoped the family’s tragedy would lead to change, though “I’m not even sure what that will look like.”</p><p>“But for something good, for people to stop and take a breath and take a look and have a dialog,” he said. “That’s the broader mission of what we want, for people to come together and take care of each other.”</p><p>The Justice Department has said it sees no basis to open a federal civil rights investigation into Good’s death, but the family has hired a law firm that is conducting its own investigation and exploring potential legal action.</p><p>Family members said no one from the federal government has contacted them about Good’s killing, and they are unsure if anyone will be held accountable.</p><p>“All we can do is speak out and hope that our sincere words are enough to enact some kind of change,” Brent Ganger said.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

(Fabrice COFFRINI)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Rebeca Grynspan is upbeat about her chances of becoming the next head of the United Nations, which she insists must become more agile in tackling the world&#39;s crises.</p><p>The Costa Rican former vice-president said she wanted to rebuild global trust in the United Nations if she becomes its next secretary-general.</p><p>&quot;We are very optimistic. I think that I am more than a viable candidate,&quot; Grynspan said on Friday, her last working day before stepping aside as head of the UN trade and development agency UNCTAD to focus on her campaign.</p><p>The second term of current UN chief Antonio Guterres expires at the end of the year.</p><p>&quot;My profile is right for this moment. I know the UN enough to reform it and enough to defend it,&quot; she told the UN correspondents&#39; association ACANU.</p><p>&quot;I have a lot of experience in my political life, taking decisions under a lot of stress and in complex situations. I have been in the highest positions in the UN.&quot;</p><p>It is Latin America&#39;s turn next for the top UN job and two other candidates are running: former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, and Rafael Grossi, the Argentinian head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p>Founded in 1945, the UN has never had a woman secretary-general.</p><p>Grynspan, an economist, is not looking to be chosen on that basis.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t need any favours to be elected for the secretary-general; I just need people not to discriminate me for being a woman,&quot; the 70-year-old said.</p><p>&quot;If the competition will be fair, with no biases, I will make it. I have the CV; I have the merits.&quot;</p><p>- Rebuilding trust -</p><p>Last month, Guterres warned that the UN was facing financial collapse and could run out of cash by July, with member states neither paying in full nor or time.</p><p>&quot;The UN has to change,&quot; said Grynspan.</p><p>There are far greater capacities in civil society and the private sector than in 1945, &quot;and we need to be able to harness that: we don&#39;t have to do everything in the UN.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>As for peace and security, &quot;prevention and mediation are essential. But they need agility and flexibility from the structures of the UN. And I don&#39;t think we have that right now.&quot;</p><p>US President Donald Trump has slashed funding to some UN agencies and has repeatedly questioned the UN&#39;s relevance and attacked its priorities, setting up his own &quot;Board of Peace&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The UN is unique because it&#39;s the only legitimate, universal organisation,&quot; said Grynspan.</p><p>&quot;We need to rebuild trust with the member states. We need to regain the belief that the UN is useful to solve problems,&quot; she said, vowing to bring her personal qualities to the task.</p><p>&quot;I am able to reach to people not only with logic, but also with inspiration, optimism and hope,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;We need more of that too, because we need to connect again much more with people. We will need to conquer the hearts and minds again.&quot;</p><p>- Leadership style -</p><p>The UNCTAD chief said her leadership style revolved around being &quot;direct, honest, and evidence-based... There have to be reasons, not only emotions.&quot;</p><p>Grynspan recounted that her parents, who were from Poland, &quot;barely survived&quot; World War II. Her maternal grandparents were killed in the Holocaust.</p><p>Her parents went &quot;with nothing&quot; to Costa Rica, a country that &quot;allowed them to have a good life&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Costa Rica has taught me a lot. It&#39;s a country that I not only love dearly, but I admire,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I am not an impetuous person. I think things through. I have the serenity not to lose it under tension and under pressure. I consult. I hear. And I am brave. I take risks.&quot;</p><p>rjm/ceg</p></div></article></div>",

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, airlines cut hiring for years, creating what analysts call a “lost generation” of mechanics. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic, when thousands left the industry. At the same time, fewer military technicians—once a major source of civilian aircraft mechanics—are entering the workforce.</p><p>The overall worker shortage means maintenance takes longer and planes spend more time on the ground. Airlines are also keeping jets in service longer, increasing the amount of work required.</p><p>“It will drive up costs for airlines,” Prentice said. “And that gets passed on to passengers.”</p><p>Training for mechanics does not end at Cincinnati State. At a nearby GE Aerospace facility, about 4,000 mechanics arrive every year for advanced instruction that’s required before they can work on certain engines. The goal, GE Aerospace says, is consistency and safety across a rapidly growing global fleet.</p><p>Back in the Cincinnati State hangar, students just now entering the field say the timing could not be better.</p><p>“There’s ample overtime opportunity, ample growth,” Brown said. “Companies will pay you to relocate and pay pretty high wages.”</p><p>Instructor Rohling said the new generation is already changing the industry.</p><p>“They want to learn,” he said. “They want to work on airplanes.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The move on Friday by the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education comes two days after the FBI served search warrants at his home and the district’s headquarters.</p><p>Authorities have not provided details of the nature of the investigation involving the nation’s second-largest school district, which serves more than 500,000 students.</p><p>Carvalho became superintendent in 2022. He previously led the public schools in Miami.</p><p>Andres Chait, the chief of school operations, will take over the helm while Carvalho is on leave, the district said.</p><p>Carvalho has not responded to a request for comment. The FBI on Wednesday also searched a third location near Miami. The Miami Herald reported the Florida property belonged to Debra Kerr, who previously worked with AllHere, an education technology company that had a contract with Los Angeles schools before it collapsed and its leader was indicted for fraud. She could not be reached for comment Thursday.</p><p>In 2024, Carvalho heavily touted a deal with AllHere for an AI chatbot named “Ed” designed to help students. But about three months after unveiling the technology and paying the company $3 million, the district dropped its dealings with AllHere, which collapsed into bankruptcy. Months later, founder Joanna Smith-Griffin was charged with securities and wire fraud, along with identity theft.</p><p>The school district said in a statement Wednesday that it “is cooperating with the investigation and we do not have further information at this time.”</p><p>Carvalho denied personal involvement in the selection of AllHere, according to the Los Angeles Times. After Smith-Griffin was indicted, Carvalho said he would appoint a task force to examine what went wrong with the LA school district’s project, but there have been no public announcements about it since.</p><p>Kerr, an education technology salesperson who connects companies with schools, said she was never paid her $630,000 commission for her work in closing the AllHere deal with the LA district, according to a news organization, The 74, that covered the company’s bankruptcy hearings in 2024.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The 74 reported that Kerr had longstanding ties with Carvalho from when he oversaw the Florida district and that her son who worked for AllHere pitched the technology to LA school leaders after he took over the helm there. The Associated Press was unable to reach Kerr for comment.</p><p>Over the past five years in Los Angeles, Carvalho has been lauded for the district’s improvements to academic performance. He won similar praise while overseeing Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Florida’s largest school district, where the national superintendents association named him Superintendent of the Year in 2014.</p><p>Spain knighted the Portugal-born administrator in 2021 for his work in expanding Spanish-language programs for Miami-Dade County schools.</p><p>Months later, Carvalho took the job in California and became a harsh critic of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, especially following raids in Los Angeles last year.</p><p>Carvalho arrived in Los Angeles at a critical moment, as the district found itself flush with funding from state and federal COVID-19 relief money but still struggling with the impacts of the pandemic, including learning losses and declining enrollment. He previously sparred with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over his order that schools not require masks during the pandemic.</p><p>The Miami-Dade school system said in a statement that it was aware of the investigation involving Carvalho but did not have any comment at this time.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

what he said was the pair’s “brief acquaintance” under more than six hours of questioning from lawmakers who sought to unravel the former president’s ties to the late convicted sex offender.</p><p>“I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,” Clinton said in his opening statement to the House Oversight Committee, shared publicly on social media. “I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn’t see. I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn’t do. I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.”</p><p>Clinton’s testimony capped a high-profile two days in the Republican-led panel’s Epstein inquiry, following the sworn testimony of his wife <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the day before;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the day before</a>.</p><p>The appearance saw lawmakers trek to Chappaqua, New York, to avoid the spectacle of a former president testifying under oath in Washington. But Clinton’s deposition behind closed doors was no less historic. He became the first former president compelled to testify under subpoena before a congressional committee, setting a new precedent that could have sweeping ramifications, including for President Donald Trump.</p><p>Throughout the deposition, lawmakers said, Clinton was cooperative and answered questions from both parties, but there were some instances he couldn’t remember.</p><p>“I think everybody would agree that he’s been very cooperative, and he’s actually answering the questions fairly to the best of his ability. He has not taken a pass on pleading the fifth for any questions,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, said of Clinton.</p><p>Attorneys for the Clintons and the Republican-led panel negotiated behind the scenes – through email exchanges, letters and phone calls – for months over the terms of the interview. Ultimately, the pair only agreed to comply with their subpoenas after the House had moved toward a bipartisan vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear as scheduled.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Unlike his wife, who testified on Thursday that she <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/hillary-clinton-deposition-epstein-bill?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:never met;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">never met</a> Epstein, Clinton has a documented history of interactions with him and Ghislaine Maxwell – who was convicted in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>Lawmakers made Clinton answer for materials that have been made public from the Justice Department’s investigation into Epstein.</p><p>In one instance, Clinton said he did not know a woman with whom he was photographed in a jacuzzi – an image that was widely circulated after it was earlier made public by the Justice Department.

they are set to receive as soon as Friday, according to a union official. The reduced pay comes as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/politics/department-homeland-security-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:partial government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">partial government shutdown</a> ends its second week with no resolution in sight.</p><p>The impasse could lead to staffing shortages and airport delays for some travelers, especially the longer TSA workers go without pay. (Air traffic controllers, however, are not affected by this partial shutdown.)</p><p>The agency is also making some changes to at least one trusted traveler program, temporarily halting the Global Entry program. Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/politics/shutdonw-tsa-precheck-global-entry-suspended-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program</a> but then reversed that decision.</p><p>However, many DHS workers will continue to be paid, despite the shutdown. Paychecks for sworn law enforcement officers in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Patrol and the US Secret Service, as well as for US Coast Guard military personnel, are being funded by the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” which President Donald Trump signed into law last summer, according to a senior administration official.</p><p>Other positions that work on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and border security priorities, such as technology specialists and attorneys, are also being paid through the president’s domestic policy package, the official said. The legislation provided the agency with a $165 billion infusion, which funneled $75 billion to ICE, alone, and $64 billion to CBP.</p><p>Other DHS employees throughout the agency are set to receive partial paychecks in coming days unless Congress acts. Most affected workers will only be paid for the second week of February in their next checks since the agency’s funding lapsed as of February 14.</p><p>These smaller paychecks will be the last many DHS employees receive until Congress comes to an agreement to fund the agency for part or all of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. The White House and Democrats have been negotiating reforms to the agency’s immigration enforcement operations after two US citizens were fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis in January. Senate Democrats are demanding changes before they’ll support appropriating more money for DHS.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Many TSA employees are already starting to struggle financially, concerned about how they’ll afford their March housing costs and day care, among other expenses, said Johnny Jones, secretary/treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees TSA Council 100, the union representing 46,000 uniformed TSA workers.</p><p>“You’re going to see TSA officers in food bank lines in a couple of days,” he said, adding that several colleagues have taken out payday loans.</p><p>In total, about 61,000 TSA employees must remain on the job at the nation’s more than 430 commercial airports during a shutdown. Many live paycheck to paycheck, Ha Nguyen McNeill, a senior official performing the duties of TSA administrator, said in written testimony for a House subcommittee hearing before the funding lapsed.</p><p>Overall, more than 90% of DHS’ 272,000 employees will continue working during a lapse, according to the agency’s September shutdown plan covering the first five days of an impasse. More than 93% of ICE and CBP workers will remain on the job.</p><p>Only about 44,500 staffers will continue to be paid through other appropriations, according to the shutdown plan.</p><p>During last fall’s shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/tsa-precheck-noem-dhs-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:DHS Secretary Kristi Noem;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">DHS Secretary Kristi Noem</a> said that 70,000 law enforcement personnel, including in CBP, ICE and other divisions, would receive their paychecks thanks to the funding from the “big, beautiful bill.”</p><p>DHS is using funds from the package to pay nearly 58,000 CBP employees, including officers and border patrol enforcement personnel, according to an email sent this week by the National Treasury Employees Union, obtained by CNN.</p><p>Federal employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends, according to a 2019 law.</p><p><em>This story has been update with additional details.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

any wrongdoing (HANDOUT)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former US president Bill Clinton denied wrongdoing Friday to a congressional panel probing his links to Jeffrey Epstein, as Democrats seek to shift focus onto Donald Trump&#39;s own ties to the notorious sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently in the Epstein files but insists that he broke ties well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>&quot;I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,&quot; Clinton said in his opening statement, shared on social media.</p><p>The Republican chair of the House committee probing Epstein, James Comer, said &quot;we believe this was a very productive deposition that President Clinton answered every question -- or attempted to answer every question.&quot;</p><p>Comer&#39;s Republican colleague Nancy Mace alleged there were &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in his testimony without providing specific examples.</p><p>Democrats on the committee have reiterated their call for Trump, who also has well-documented links to Epstein, to be quizzed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be real, we are talking to the wrong president,&quot; said Democrat committee member Suhas&nbsp;Subramanyam, who also emphasized that Clinton had not dodged any questions.</p><p>In his statement, Clinton did not name Trump directly but said &quot;no person is above the law, even presidents -- especially presidents.&quot;</p><p>As for Trump, he repeated his skepticism over the whole process, telling reporters he likes Clinton &quot;and I don&#39;t like seeing him deposed.&quot;</p><p>Being mentioned in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing and Clinton -- like Trump -- has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>Clinton follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday and defiantly called for Trump to appear before the panel.</p><p>The lawmakers should ask Trump &quot;directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors, with Bill Clinton likening the proceedings to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot; The couple has called for them to be open and televised.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hillary Clinton said she had never known Epstein or visited the properties where he hosted world celebrities and powerful business and political figures -- as well as allegedly trafficking young women and girls.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein but said he never visited the financier&#39;s infamous private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14, but died in a New York jail cell in 2019 before he could be tried on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but like much else around Epstein is the subject of lurid conspiracy theories.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- &#39;Turned him in&#39; -</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing Bill Clinton reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein was in the White House 17 times while Bill Clinton was President. We know that Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane at least 27 times. So those are questions that we&#39;re going to ask,&quot; said Comer.</p><p>Clinton said in his opening statement &quot;not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing -- I would have turned him in.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, home to the Clintons, where dozens of journalists and Secret Service officers have converged.</p><p>pel-gw/sms</p></div></article></div>",
