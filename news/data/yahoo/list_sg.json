The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.</p><p>Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><p>The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional development. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.</p><p>“It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.</p><p>Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”</p><p>The Democrat, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/14/politics/fetterman-democrats-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:has been outspoken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">has been outspoken</a> against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.</p><p>The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/safety-net-programs-at-risk-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:critical social safety net programs at risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">critical social safety net programs at risk</a> in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.</p><p>Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills. But lawmakers involved in those talks offered no more clarity about whether it could indeed end the standoff.</p><p>Asked about the effort by some Senate Democrats to pass a bill to temporarily extend SNAP benefits, Fetterman questioned why Congress couldn’t also pay Capitol police officers, saying that “the world’s biggest lethal military in the world has relied on a donor to pay our service members last week. I mean, that’s a disgrace.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.</p><p>“You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.</p><p>“For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”</p><p>“We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.</p><p>Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”</p><p>“Americans are not leverage. This is not, this is not some shitty game show about who’s winning or whatever. It’s just like we have to be better than this and just open this up,” he said.</p><p>CNN’s Casey Riddle and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.</p><p>Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.</p><p>The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.</p><p>Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.</p><p>“I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”</p><p>Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.</p><p>A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”</p><p>He seemed less cautious in his <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Truth Social message;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Truth Social message</a> this week.</p><p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”</p><p>Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.</p><p>“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.</p><p>He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.</p><p>Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.</p><p>Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.</p><p>“Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.</p><p>Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.</p><p>“I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.</p><p>“I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”</p><p>If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.</p><p>“The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.</p><p>Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.</p><p>In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.</p><p>In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”</p><p>“I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.</p><p>He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.</p><p>Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.</p><p>“If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.</p><p>“The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.</p><p>“But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Trump had urged his Justice Department to prosecute Comey, along with several other political nemeses.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tariff-shelf-myth_n_69024b07e4b03f34d7f916bc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Invents Another Hero Myth, This Time Making His Aides Sound Like Fools;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Trump Invents Another Hero Myth, This Time Making His Aides Sound Like Fools</a></strong></p><p>In the 2020 testimony, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) asked Comey about previous testimony he gave in 2017, when he answered questions from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) about media leaks. Comey had said he did not leak information about FBI investigations into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, or authorize anyone else to do so. He then stood by his responses three years later.</p><p>In his new filing, Comey says that Cruz’s line of questioning was “fundamentally ambiguous” and that Comey had told the “literal truth” in response.</p><p>“Fundamental to any false statement charge are both clear questions and false answers. Neither exists here,” read the motion to dismiss the case. It also pointed out that Cruz mischaracterized statements made by another former FBI official in his questioning.</p><p>Comey went on to argue that the second count against him failed to state, specifically, “which ‘false and misleading statements’ Mr. Comey allegedly made, why they were allegedly false or misleading, or even which investigation he allegedly endeavored to corrupt.”</p><p>He said both counts should be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the Trump administration could not bring them again.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-carville-warning-trump-admin-2028-election_n_68fd3f33e4b0049ce5fd217b?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:James Carville Rings Alarm On Trump Admin, 2028 Election: &#39;They&#39;re Just Getting Started&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">James Carville Rings Alarm On Trump Admin, 2028 Election: &#39;They&#39;re Just Getting Started&#39;</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/letitia-james-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges_n_68fa508fe4b071f32a2735d9?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:‘I Am Fearless’: Letitia James Pleads Not Guilty To Fraud Charges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">‘I Am Fearless’: Letitia James Pleads Not Guilty To Fraud Charges</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-comey-criminal-charges_n_68f6a0a0e4b09d351b44ea17?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:James Comey Asks Judge To Dismiss Criminal Case Against Him;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">James Comey Asks Judge To Dismiss Criminal Case Against Him</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-comey-files-motion-to-dismiss-charges-based-on-ambiguity-sloppiness_n_6903d378e4b0b48d8a1bc10e?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”</p><p>The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.</p><p>The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.</p><h3>Taranto sentenced to 21 months</h3><p>When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.</p><p>Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.</p><p>The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.</p><p>Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention.
