building, has been released, after New York City’s mayor raised her case with President Donald Trump.</p><p>At about 6:30 a.m. Thursday, agents from the Department of Homeland Security entered a university-owned residence and took Ellie Aghayeva into custody, Columbia University’s Acting President Claire Shipman said <a

She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,” the agency’s statement said.</p><p>When asked by CNN whether the agents misrepresented themselves as searching for a missing person, the agency replied, “Homeland Security Investigators verbally identified themselves and visibly wore badges around their necks. They did NOT and would not identify themselves as NYPD.”</p><p>A spokesperson for DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said Aghayeva had been placed in removal proceedings and “released while she waits for her hearing,” according to the Associated Press.</p><p>CNN has reached out to DHS and Aghayeva’s lawyer for further information.</p><p>Aghayeva, who has a sizeable social media following, initially shared a story on Instagram Thursday, showing a photo of just her legs with the caption: “DHS illegally arrested me.

Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, expressed widespread criticism of the incident.</p><p>“Let’s be clear about what happened: ICE agents didn’t have the proper warrant, so they lied to gain access to a student’s private residence,” Hochul said in <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/2027066938640183657\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a statement on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a statement on X</a>. Hochul has proposed legislation that would bar ICE from entering sensitive locations such as schools and dormitories.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the dean of the New York congressional delegation, and Assemblymember Micah Lasher said in a statement they were “disgusted and outraged,” calling the action dangerous and fear-inducing.</p><p>Mamdani, who was in Washington to discuss his housing initiatives with Trump, raised Aghayeva’s detention with the president and urged she be released, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.</p><p>“I shared my concerns about Columbia student Elmina Aghayeva, who was detained by ICE this morning,” Mamdani wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/2027129042432913711?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">on X</a>, shortly after their meeting.</p><p>Mamdani said Trump called him, writing: “He has just informed me that she will be released imminently.”</p><p>Aghayeva later shared on Instagram she had been released, saying she was “safe and okay,” and on her way home. “I am in complete shock over what happened … I need a little bit of time to process everything I will come back soon. But please don’t worry,” she wrote.</p><p>Columbia said <a href=\"https://x.com/Columbia/status/2027130847782977981\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">in a post on X</a> that it was “relieved and thrilled” that Aghayeva was released. It said it is working to contact Aghayeva’s family and ensure the student has access to legal support.</p><p>Aghayeva is an international student and senior double majoring in neuroscience and political science, according to the American Association of University Professors.</p><p>She has amassed more than 100,000 followers on social media, regularly posting about her library study sessions, as well as her lifestyle and productivity habits.</p><p>In her statement, Columbia’s president reiterated that law enforcement agencies must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to gain access to non-public areas of the university, including housing, classrooms, and areas requiring key card access.</p><p>“All law enforcement agencies—including DHS and ICE—are obligated to follow established legal and ethical standards,” Shipman wrote in her letter following Aghayeva’s release. “And we expect those standards to be respected.”</p><h3>Columbia students targeted in federal immigration actions</h3><p>Aghayeva’s arrest comes nearly a year after Palestinian activist and Columbia student <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/us/mahmoud-khalil-ordered-released-by-judge?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mahmoud Khalil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mahmoud Khalil</a> was taken into ICE custody on March 8, 2025.

Adriano Espaillat, a former undocumented immigrant, said in a post<a href=\"https://x.com/repespaillat/status/2027060032995549665?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> on X</a> students and faculty “should not fear for their safety in their dorm rooms, the classroom, or anywhere else on campus,” and urged the university to bolster protections.</p><p>“This exhibit of the Trump Administration’s lawless actions — which are rarely supported by legitimate warrants or subpoenas — is yet another reminder that Columbia University and other institutions must enhance the protections and policies they utilize to create a safe environment for those they serve and employ,” Espaillat <a href=\"https://x.com/repespaillat/status/2027060032995549665?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote.</a></p><p>In a statement, Columbia University <a href=\"https://communications.news.columbia.edu/news/important-additional-updates-columbia-university\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">announced</a> it is taking additional steps to protect students and staff from similar incidents, with extra public safety patrols being deployed to residential buildings.</p><p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p><p>CNN’s Sara Smart, Taylor Galgano, Maria Santana and Katherine Koretski contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

neighbours at &quot;open war&quot; following months of tit-for-tat clashes.</p><p>AFP journalists in Kabul and Kandahar heard blasts and jets overhead until dawn, as Pakistan launched air strikes on the Afghan capital and the southern power base of the Taliban authorities.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s latest operation came after Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops on Thursday night over earlier air strikes by Islamabad.</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Most of the attacks have been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has stepped up assaults in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021.</p><p>&quot;Afghan Taliban defence targets were targeted in Kabul, Paktia (province) and Kandahar,&quot; Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar posted on X, while defence minister

official said Friday, as the premier pushes ahead with a defence overhaul.</p><p>Newly empowered after a landslide victory in snap elections this month, Takaichi has vowed to make Japan &quot;strong and prosperous&quot; through key policy changes including in defence and intelligence.</p><p>The plans come as a months-long diplomatic row between Japan and China over comments Takaichi made on Taiwan rumbles on.</p><p>The proposal, agreed by the intelligence strategy headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),&nbsp;includes establishing an upgraded intelligence bureau and strengthening &quot;foreign intelligence collection capabilities&quot;, an LDP official told AFP.</p><p>It calls for a mandatory registration system for foreign agents -- such as individuals and corporations lobbying within Japan on behalf of other governments -- as part of counterintelligence measures.</p><p>The plan, which also includes a ban on the use of mobile phones in key government buildings, is expected to be submitted to Takaichi next week, the Asahi Shimbun and other local media reported.</p><p>&quot;One of the central pillars of the major policy shift (under Takaichi) is a fundamental strengthening of intelligence,&quot; the LDP&#39;s policy chief Takayuki Kobayashi said at the meeting Thursday where plans were approved.</p><p>&quot;Simply creating an organisation on paper is utterly meaningless; the question is how we can turn it into a truly living, functioning body,&quot; he said.</p><p>Separately, the LDP on Wednesday proposed changes to Japan&#39;s stringent rules on exporting military equipment so as to enable exports of lethal weapons, local reports said.</p><p>The LDP official could not immediately confirm the proposal.</p><p>Takaichi has also said that she plans to revise three key national security policy documents this year to reflect the changing security environment.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

in October, suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.</p><p>China, which regards the democratic island as part of its territory and has not ruled out force to annex it, was furious.</p><p>It summoned Tokyo&#39;s ambassador, warned Chinese citizens against visiting Japan and in December J-15 jets from China&#39;s Liaoning aircraft carrier twice locked radar on Japanese aircraft in international waters near Okinawa, according to Japan.</p><p>Takaichi has vowed that Japan will steadfastly protect its territory, territorial waters and airspace.</p><p>Beijing&#39;s top diplomat Wang Yi told the Munich Security Conference earlier this month that forces in Japan were seeking to &quot;revive militarism&quot;.</p><p>While she has said in parliament she will not change the rules, local media have reported that Takaichi is considering allowing US nuclear weapons into Japanese territory, a revision to the country&#39;s non-nuclear principles of not producing, possessing or permitting the introduction of the weapons into the country.</p><p>kh/aph/ane</p></div></article></div>",

Property developers will get a better sense of how much tax they will be charged for proposed projects, using a new tool that immediately estimates land betterment charges (LBC).</p><p>Having this upfront certainty on project costs is critical for business decisions, said Law Minister Edwin Tong on Feb 27, when he announced these changes at the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (Redas) Spring Festival lunch.</p><p>The LBC is a tax levied when planning permission is granted for development, or when land value increases due to improved use.</p><p>It is also a key revenue source that allows the Government to invest in infrastructure that enables development, Mr Tong said.</p><p>Collections from other taxes were nearly 68 per cent above the estimate at $3.98 billion, due to higher-than-expected LBC collections, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in his Budget speech on Feb 12.</p><p>The new tool, launched on Feb 27 by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), will be part of its OneMap portal. It will compute the estimated LBC from key inputs, and allow developers to test scenarios using different development options.</p><p>Previously, developers had to do the calculations for the land betterment charges on their own.</p><p>The authorities have also sped up the valuation process for LBC cases that require spot valuations, following developers’ feedback.</p><p>SLA has recently brought forward the start of the valuation process for such cases to the provisional permission stage, which could shave up to six months off the previous process, Mr Tong said.</p><p>The LBC regime was <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/strong-property-market-singapores-reopening-fuel-higher-land-betterment-charge-rates\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:introduced in August 2022.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">introduced in August 2022.</a> It replaced the development charge and differential premium systems, which were administered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and SLA respectively.</p><p>This meant that landowners and developers no longer need to apply to different agencies for the payment of these charges, Mr Tong noted.</p><p>Other improvements include enhancing the framework to provide greater transparency and certainty for solar operators.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>With effect from Sept 1, 2025, solar deployments are now classified as utilities under use group D in the LBC use groups table. This allows solar developers to calculate their LBC liability using the table of rates, instead of relying on a spot valuation.</p><p>This year, SLA will also launch the pilot digital conveyancing portal (DCP), which aims to transform the current paper-based conveyancing process into a paperless digital system for all property transactions in Singapore.</p><p>Such a system would reduce the administrative burden for the real estate industry, boost productivity and allow for better coordination between lawyers, banks, real estate professionals and government agencies, Mr Tong said.</p><p>The Electronic Conveyancing &amp; Other Matters Act was passed by Parliament on Oct 15, 2025. The amendments will facilitate the implementation of the DCP, starting with the pilot for the grant and exercise of the option to purchase for private residential resale transactions.</p><p>Mr Tong also said that the government has stepped up efforts in recent years to use state properties to support unique developments that add character and vibrancy, such as New Bahru, which was formerly Nan Chiau Girls’ High School, and The Foundry, which used to house the Elections Department. These are run by the tenants in state properties.</p><p>“We understand the need to provide industry with new opportunities to partner with the Government in harnessing the value of our state properties,” he said.</p><p>Earlier this month, SLA launched a concept and price tender for a cluster of pre-World War II heritage bungalows in Adam Park for serviced apartment use on a 30-year leasehold tenure.</p><p>“This is a rare opportunity for real estate developers to test new living concepts in a unique and historically significant setting,” Mr Tong said, adding that SLA is also exploring longer tenures for state properties.</p><p>On a Redas initiative to build a skilled real estate work force, Mr Tong said it was encouraging that more than 40 organisations are interested.</p><p>Redas president Tan Swee Yiow said that as part of this initiative, more than 50 internships have been offered to Year 1 and Year 2 Business students at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>These internships - in areas such as asset management, capital markets, fintech, and research and valuation - will give them the early exposure they need to see the full breadth of career possibilities in real estate, Mr Tan said.</p><p>He added: “Fewer are choosing real estate today. If this trend continues, we risk a smaller pool of trained professionals in the years ahead.”</p><p>Beyond internships, Mr Tan said industry partners are also interested to offer management traineeships and to come on board as mentors.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/new-tool-launched-to-help-businesses-estimate-land-betterment-charges-up-front?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

ELLIS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Britain&#39;s ruling Labour party on Friday lost a crunch local poll in one of its traditional northern English heartlands to the left-wing Greens, adding to the woes of unpopular Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Labour also finished behind the hard-right Reform UK party in the by-election for the parliamentary seat of Gorton and Denton in Manchester, as the country’s traditional two-party system fractures.</p><p>The third-place finish in a seat that Labour has dominated for decades is likely to increase chatter about how much longer the 63-year-old Starmer can stay in office.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons appear more willing to look towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>Labour won the constituency with almost 51 percent of the vote at the July 2024 general election that swept Starmer to power and ousted the Conservatives from 14 consecutive years in office.</p><p>But the government has since been beset by numerous policy reversals and several rows, including over the appointment of Peter Mandelson, an associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as Britain&#39;s ambassador to Washington.</p><p>Polls suggest Starmer is the most unpopular British prime minister since surveys began and earlier this month he faced down calls from within his own party to resign.</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and plasterer won with almost 15,000 votes and becomes the Green’s fifth MP in the 650-seat British parliament.</p><p>Reform candidate Matt Goodwin, a 44-year-old political scientist registered some 10,500 votes, while Labour won just over 9,300.</p><p>The vote&nbsp;was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne on health grounds.</p><p>Starmer has spent much of his time in office targeting Reform, which leads national polls, by toughening Labour’s immigration policies.</p><p>But the stance has alienated elements of the party&#39;s left-wing base and young people, who appear to be turning towards the Greens, whose leader Zack Polanski is also appealing to pro-Palestinian supporters.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;The Green Party is offering hope to the wider society, marginalised people, and I think they&#39;re the choice for working people,&quot; writer Matt Alton, 31, told AFP on Thursday after casting his ballot.</p><p>Anti-immigration Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, have led national surveys for over a year. The next general election is not expected until 2029.</p><p>Labour&#39;s candidate, Angeliki Stogia, was selected to run after the party&#39;s ruling body blocked the candidacy of popular Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.</p><p>Burnham&#39;s bid to become an MP was widely seen as a precursor for a potential leadership challenge from the party&#39;s left against Starmer,&nbsp;who hails from the party&#39;s centre right.</p><p>Starmer faces another critical period in May with elections in Scotland, Wales and London&nbsp;that pollsters predict will be painful for Labour.</p><p>pdh/jm/ceg</p></div></article></div>",

Donald Trump boasted: &quot;No one cares more about protecting America&#39;s youth than our wonderful first lady.&quot;</p><p>Melania&#39;s visit comes as the president spearheads his &quot;Board of

seek to shift focus onto Donald Trump&#39;s own ties to the convicted sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently throughout the latest Epstein files disclosures, with the former president insisting that he broke ties with him well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>Mere mention in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing, and Clinton has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>He follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday, defiantly calling for President Trump -- who like Bill Clinton had ties with Epstein -- to appear before the panel.</p><p>&quot;If this committee is serious about learning the truth about Epstein&#39;s trafficking crimes... it would ask (Trump) directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said in an opening statement published online.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors even though the Clintons called for them to be open and televised, a move Bill Clinton denounced as akin to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot;</p><p>The grilling comes with greater peril for the former president than for his wife, as he has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein, but said he never visited the shady financier&#39;s private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein associated with the world&#39;s rich, famous and powerful, and was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.</p><p>He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee is probing those who were linked to Epstein, particularly in light of the Justice Department&#39;s disclosures of millions of new documents related to its investigation of him.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hillary insisted that she had neither flown on Epstein&#39;s plane nor visited his island.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify in the panel&#39;s probe, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- Newly released pictures -</p><p>Hillary Clinton said in her opening statement to the panel that it &quot;justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me be as clear as I can. I do not.&quot;</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Bill Clinton features prominently in the trove of investigative files related to Epstein released by the Justice Department but has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing the former president reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>David Markus, an attorney for Maxwell, said recently that Clinton and Trump are &quot;innocent of any wrongdoing.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, where the Clintons reside.</p><p>Dozens of journalists have converged on the wealthy hamlet and the Secret Service erected metal barricades around the arts center where the depositions are happening.</p><p>Republican committee chair James Comer said at the conclusion of Hillary&#39;s appearance that lawmakers had &quot;a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow.&quot;</p><p>pel-gw/aha</p></div></article></div>",
