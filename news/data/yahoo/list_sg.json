wobbled Thursday as traders digested a high-stakes meeting between the US and Chinese presidents, mixed company earnings and uncertainty over further US interest rate cuts.</p><p>US President Donald Trump described his meeting in South Korea with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- their first since 2019, during Trump&#39;s first term -- as &quot;amazing&quot;.</p><p>The two leaders agreed to calm the US-China trade war that has shaken global markets, with Washington cutting some tariffs and Beijing committing to keep supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>But the frenzy on stock markets that led to new records in the run-up to the meeting and earnings reports by tech giants faded.</p><p>Asia markets ended mostly lower, while in Europe both Frankfurt and London ended the day flat after wobbling in afternoon trading.</p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow rose but the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were both lower in early afternoon trading.</p><p>&quot;Doubts over the possible returns on investments planned for artificial general intelligence, the Fed&#39;s &#39;hawkish&#39; rate cut and President Trump&#39;s underwhelming trade deal with China have done little to boost sentiment,&quot; said David Morrison, senior market analyst&nbsp;at financial services provider&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Nation.</p><p>Big US tech companies were in focus again Thursday, with investors reacting to earnings reports from Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft released after Wall Street closed on Wednesday.</p><p>Shares in Meta dove around 10 percent&nbsp;after third-quarter profits missed analysts&#39; expectations.</p><p>Profits sank 83 percent to $2.7 billion following a roughly $16-billion hit from a one-time accounting shift due to a US fiscal overhaul legislation favoured by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Microsoft shares shed 2.7 percent and shares in Google-parent Alphabet rose 4.6 percent.</p><p>Microsoft reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results but questions arose about the pace of AI monetisation.</p><p>&quot;These latest results highlight the business models of the big technology firms are becoming more capital intensive, as they build out their&nbsp;AI&nbsp;capabilities,&quot; said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He added, however, that if AI fails to deliver revenue streams, &quot;the effect on share prices could be brutal.&quot;</p><p>However Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada said that &quot;unless there&#39;s a significant negative surprise from the remaining tech giants yet to report, equities could well have further room to climb.&quot;</p><p>Amazon and Apple report after US markets close on Thursday.</p><p>Shares in Nvidia gave up 1.6 percent a day after it became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value. The company reports results of its third quarter, which ended this week, on November 19.</p><p>Seoul&#39;s stock market got a lift from tech giant Samsung Electronics posting a 32-percent rise in on-year profits for the third quarter, driven by AI-fuelled market demand for memory chips.</p><p>The European Central Bank held interest rates steady, as expected, as inflation hovers around its target and the eurozone economy holds up.</p><p>Data on Thursday showed the eurozone economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>The Bank of Japan also held interest rates steady on Thursday, sending the yen higher, after the US Federal Reserve delivered a second quarter-point rate cut.</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell&#39;s announcement, however, cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar on Wednesday.</p><p>Shares in auto giant Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Fiat and Peugeot,&nbsp;sank&nbsp;over eight percent despite rising sales as the group said it expected to incur charges in the second half of the year.</p><p>- Key figures at around 1630 GMT -</p><p>New York - Dow:&nbsp;UP 0.5 percent at 47,856.70 points</p><p>New York - S&amp;P 500:&nbsp;DOWN 0.3 percent at 6,868.95</p><p>New York - Nasdaq Composite:&nbsp;DOWN 0.8 percent at 23,758.70</p><p>London - FTSE 100:&nbsp;FLAT at 9,760.06&nbsp;(close)</p><p>Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.5 percent at 8,157.29 (close)</p><p>Frankfurt - DAX: FLAT&nbsp;at 24,118.89 (close)</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225:&nbsp;FLAT at 51,325.61 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index:&nbsp;DOWN 0.2 percent at 26,282.69 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite:&nbsp;DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,986.90 (close)</p><p>Euro/dollar:&nbsp;DOWN at $1.1566 from $1.1595 on Wednesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN&nbsp;at $1.3146 from $1.3187</p><p>Dollar/yen: UP at 154.11 yen from 152.82 yen</p><p>Euro/pound:&nbsp;UP at 87.99 from 87.94 pence</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude:&nbsp;DOWN less than 0.1 percent at $64.29 per barrel</p><p>West Texas Intermediate:&nbsp;UP less than 0.1 percent at $60.53 per barrel</p><p>burs-rl/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

caused a major strain in Israel&#39;s right-wing ruling coalition.</p><p>The vast crowd were demonstrating to demand a law guaranteeing their right to avoid Israel&#39;s mandatory military service -- long promised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Crowds of men set fire to pieces of tarpaulin as hundreds of police officers cordoned off several roads across the city, AFP correspondents reported.</p><p>Demonstrators packed onto the tops of buildings, petrol stations, bridges and balconies above a sea of fellow protesters, some of whom held signs declaring: &quot;Better to go to prison than to the army.&quot;</p><p>A helicopter flew overhead as people gathered to take part in collective prayers.</p><p>Abraham, 27, who studies in a Jerusalem religious seminary known as a yeshiva and declined to give his full name, said the goal was to preserve a lifestyle lived according to the Torah, the Jewish holy text.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t go to the army not because we are selfish, but because we try to preserve ourselves, what the Torah tells us and the rabbis tell us,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>&quot;There were hostages, and we mourned their deaths, we prayed for them three times a day, and for the soldiers,&quot; he said, referring to the captives abducted during Hamas&#39;s October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza.</p><p>&quot;We love everyone, secular people, soldiers.... We don&#39;t hate anyone. We came to unify the ultra-Orthodox community, that only wants to honour God.&quot;</p><p>Israeli police said one man fell from a height during Thursday&#39;s rally and was subsequently pronounced dead by medical personnel.</p><p>- Crackdown -</p><p>The mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices ignored in recent months and several deserters imprisoned.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Under a ruling established at the time of Israel&#39;s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass from army service.</p><p>This exemption has come under mounting pressure since the start of the war in Gaza, as the military struggles to fill its ranks.</p><p>Whether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver.</p><p>But he has so far failed to deliver.</p><p>Responding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties -- one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition -- men travelled from all over Israel to join Thursday&#39;s rally.</p><p>Police announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in Jerusalem.</p><p>Knesset member and key opposition figure Avigdor Liberman denounced the rally.</p><p>&quot;The draft evasion protest is a disgrace to the country&#39;s leadership and a spit in the face of our heroic soldiers!&quot; he wrote on X.</p><p>In June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired.</p><p>A parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist.</p><p>- Vital support for coalition -</p><p>The issue has placed Netanyahu&#39;s coalition -- one of the most right-wing in the country&#39;s history -- under severe strain.</p><p>In July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition.</p><p>The other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition.</p><p>The Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, has warned that unless military service exemptions are anchored in law, it will withdraw its support -- a move that could topple Netanyahu&#39;s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats.</p><p>Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist.</p><p>Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 percent of Israel&#39;s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.</p><p>According to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting despite opposition from their leaders, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.</p><p>lsb-mib-acc/jd/jw</p></div></article></div>",

ministers meeting in Canada on Thursday planned to launch a new alliance to counter China&#39;s critical mineral dominance, in a push for more reliable access to the resources that power advanced technologies.</p><p>The two-day Group of Seven meeting in Toronto opened hours after US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping signed an extendable one-year deal on China&#39;s supply of rare earths.</p><p>Germany&#39;s Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Katherina Reiche, told reporters the Trump-Xi deal marked &quot;a good sign,&quot; noting German reliance on Chinese critical mineral exports.</p><p>But she stressed the agreement &quot;can&#39;t prevent us&quot; from moving forward on broadening supply chains for the materials used in everything from solar panels and mobile phones to precision missiles.</p><p>&quot;We need diversification of our import routes on raw materials,&quot; Reiche said.</p><p>- Production alliance -</p><p>With concern growing about China&#39;s overwhelming dominance in rare earth refining and processing, G7 leaders announced a &quot;Critical Minerals Action Plan&quot; at a summit in western Canada in June.</p><p>Canada&#39;s Energy Minister Tim Hodgson said the Toronto meeting will aim to&nbsp;formally launch a new initiative designed to curb China&#39;s market influence.</p><p>The Critical Minerals Production Alliance will &quot;secure transparent, democratic, and sustainable critical mineral supply chains across the G7,&quot; he said.</p><p>Under the alliance, the governments of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States would mobilize private investment to expand critical mineral production that bypasses China.</p><p>The head of the critical minerals division at the International Energy Agency, Tae-Yoon Kim, told AFP the Toronto meeting offers &quot;a major opportunity... to start shifting market power.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The high concentration of critical minerals refining in a single country creates economic and national security risks,&quot; Kim said in an email ahead of the G7 talks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- Distorted markets -</p><p>A central complaint about China&#39;s conduct is that it does not adhere to market principles.</p><p>Since a high proportion of material moves through Chinese-controlled businesses, Beijing can build stockpiles and control global supply.</p><p>&quot;For decades, we&#39;ve been facing a competitor who has very consistently distorted free markets, used industrial subsidies, created overcapacity, and undermined fair trade,&quot; said Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Critical Minerals Strategy.</p><p>Hunter noted that within the G7 there are contrasting energy policy priorities.</p><p>The Trump administration, in particular, is seen as less concerned about the transition to clean energy.</p><p>G7 unity on critical minerals may also be undermined by Trump&#39;s protectionist trade policies, which have caused global economic upheaval.</p><p>But given G7 alignment on &quot;security of supply,&quot; Hunter said she saw space for cooperation.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m an optimist. I have to be, because this sector is very painful at times.&quot;</p><p>For her, progress at the Toronto meeting would include concrete action on the issue of traceability -- tracking raw materials from mining to refinement and ensuring suppliers follow global market rules.</p><p>Hunter said that &quot;opaque&quot; Chinese-controlled companies exist across the supply chain, which the G7 should strive to &quot;box out of the market&quot; with new policies on traceability and transparency.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m really interested to see what they do on that,&quot; she said, adding that processing still includes a &quot;spider web of entities&quot; where Chinese officials maintain outsized control.</p><p>&quot;We have a short window of opportunity to fix this. The window is still open -- it&#39;s just very, very small,&quot; Hunter said.</p><p>bs/des</p></div></article></div>",

about increasing lower income nations' debt (Jung Yeon-je)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The head of the UN&#39;s flagship climate fund has announced a record-breaking year for approving projects in vulnerable countries, crediting red-tape-cutting reforms for the achievement that includes a major desalination project in Jordan.</p><p>In an interview ahead of the COP30 talks in Brazil next month, Mafalda Duarte, executive director of the Green Climate Fund, also defended the use of loans -- a touchy topic given concerns about raising lower income nations&#39; debt.</p><p>Headquartered in Songdo, South Korea and operational since 2015, the GCF is the world&#39;s largest multilateral climate fund and has now committed $19.3 billion -- with a goal of reaching $50 billion by 2030.</p><p>It announced a record $3.26 billion in greenlighted projects this year, significantly more than the $2.9 billion from its second-best year in 2021.</p><p>&quot;In this current geopolitical environment, of course, you know having such a significant, record commitment from the largest multilateral Climate Fund is a positive signal among many less positive signals,&quot; Duarte told AFP.</p><p>The GCF was created to channel funds from the world&#39;s rich countries, historically most responsible for climate change, to developing nations, helping them adapt to a warming world and transition to low emissions economies.</p><p>But US disengagement from the Paris climate process and infighting in Europe, where some countries have slashed foreign aid, have cast a pall over global funding efforts.</p><p>Even so, said Duarte, &quot;with relatively small amounts of money, we can actually accomplish a lot in terms of private sector capital mobilization.&quot;</p><p>The new projects include $295 million for the Jordan Aqaba-Amman Water Desalination and Conveyance Project, described as &quot;life or death&quot; by the country, which is grappling with water scarcity.</p><p>It is the GCF&#39;s largest single financing package to date and aims to catalyze a project valued at roughly $6 billion by offsetting risk for larger lenders. </p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- Accountability, not announcements -</p><p>Duarte, a Portuguese national who worked in international development but shifted to climate after witnessing its impacts in Africa,&nbsp; credited the stronger financing pace to bureaucratic reforms she has pursued since stepping in to lead the GCF in 2023.</p><p>&quot;I came with a reform agenda to try to place GCF as a benchmark, an example of what it could look like: an institution that is efficient, agile and much more aligned with the speed and scale of investments that are needed,&quot; she said.</p><p>Her goals include cutting project review times from two years to nine months, and reducing the time to accredit partner institutions, like national agencies and banks, from three years to nine months.</p><p>The Jordan funding, like much of the work of the GCF, combines loans and grants.</p><p>Countries in the Global South and international nonprofits have long criticized loans, saying they deepen debt burdens and leave low-income countries repaying more than they receive.</p><p>But Duarte said that while grants were appropriate for the most vulnerable nations, they couldn&#39;t always be justified, for example when assisting private sector partners to turn a profit.</p><p>In Jordan&#39;s case, the project is expected to be eventually profitable, while the grant funding is for the initial stages so that households can access water affordably once the system is operational.</p><p>When it does give loans, the GCF prides itself on &quot;concessionality,&quot; meaning very low interest rates -- far better deals than middle income countries with poor investment ratings could hope to get on the commercial market.</p><p>It argues that grants, which account for around 45 percent of its outlay, cannot achieve the scale of financing required to deliver the Paris accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5C.</p><p>Duarte, who stopped eating meat to help align her personal life with her climate work, said that for her a successful COP would be one that centered on &quot;accountability&quot; -- not flashy new pledges, but delivering on existing promises.</p><p>Otherwise, she warned, future generations would look back unkindly.</p><p>&quot;They will look at us and really think, how could you guys be so slow to get it?&quot;</p><p>ia/ksb</p></div></article></div>",

painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.</p><p>Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.</p><p>Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NoBK6mnQNeZUwiaWZT67sg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/82595c23374d893813b492b3a54d08fc><noscript><img alt=\"Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NoBK6mnQNeZUwiaWZT67sg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/82595c23374d893813b492b3a54d08fc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Dodik, pictured here in Sochi, Russia, earlier this month, regularly meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. - Mikhail Metzel/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.</p><p>“What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.</p><p>The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.</p><p>Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jl0708\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:July 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">July 2017</a> for obstructing the Dayton agreement.

The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.</p><p>Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment.</p><h3>Injuries were devastating</h3><p>The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.</p><p>Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.</p><p>“She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”</p><p>The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.</p><p>A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.</p><p>Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.</p><p>In another emotional courtroom moment in December 2023, Zwerner read a statement during the sentencing of the student’s mother on charges related to the shooting.</p><p>“The boy pointed the gun directly at me and shot. The single bullet went through my left hand and lodged into my upper left chest, leaving traces of bullet fragments in both areas that will remain forever,” Zwerner said at the time.</p><p>“When this happened and emergency responders worked to keep me alive, I was not sure whether it would be my final moment on earth.”</p><h3>School official is only defendant</h3><p>Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit filed months after the shooting. A judge previously dismissed the other original defendants, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>The student’s mother was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/virgina-teacher-mother-shooting-sentenced?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentenced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentenced</a> to a total of nearly four years in prison for  child neglect and federal weapons charges.</p><p>The boy was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-no-charges?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not charged</a> with any wrongdoing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758><noscript><img alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/22/us/newport-news-virginia-teacher-shooting-gun-closet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously told CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previously told CNN</a>.</p><p>However, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/virginia-teacher-shooting-mother-guilty?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:later said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">later said</a> authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock.
