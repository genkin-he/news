Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona is appearing with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.</p><p>Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.</p><p>Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.</p><p>But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-preparations?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Zohran Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Zohran Mamdani</a>.

Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign</a> to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.</p><p>“If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.</p><p>On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.</p><p>Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/politics/jack-ciattarelli-mikie-sherrill-new-jersey-governor-race?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli</a> for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.</p><p>Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.</p><p>Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F28%2Fpolitics%2Fnew-jersey-governor-latino-vote-trump-ciattarelli-sherrill&amp;data=05%7C02%7CArlette.Saenz%40cnn.com%7C2b7b13281e57419b770c08de17a07fed%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638974175268010246%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=mcGM5hs%2F3FfbDIi%2B8Njnfkh9m6YvxX62abjvAVDIDCE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Latino vote could be key;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Latino vote could be key</a> to picking the next governor.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Sen.

That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p>“The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/02/politics/cory-booker-democratic-party-trump-redistricting?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:New Jersey Sen.

Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.</p><p>“These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.</p><p>Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates.

Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.</p><p>While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.</p><p>Texas Sen.

He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.</p><p>But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.</p><p>Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.</p><p>“Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”</p><p>Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.</p><p>In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.</p><p>Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.</p><p>“This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”</p><p>CNN’s Arit John and David Wright contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.</p><p>Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.</p><p>Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide#toc-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to</a> the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>“There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.</p><p>“Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.</p><p>“All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.</p><p>China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.</p><p>China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/politics/china-suspected-silo-fields-report?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to the Federation of American Scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to the Federation of American Scientists</a>, and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/china/china-military-parade-analysis-intl-hnk-ml-dst?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a military parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a military parade</a> in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.</p><p>When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”</p><p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”</p><p>The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.</p><h3>A new arms race?</h3><p>Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.</p><p>The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.</p><p>But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.</p><p>“If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.</p><p>Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.</p><p>When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.</p><p>“I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”</p><p>A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”</p><p>The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.</p><p>North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.</p><p>After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/asia/nuclear-testing-china-russia-us-exclusive-intl-hnk-ml?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN reported in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN reported in 2023</a> that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>“There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p><em>CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The comments echoed those he made in August suggesting he might allow a 30% or 50% scaled-down version of Nvidia&#39;s top chip to China.</p><p>But, Fist said, the B30A is a version of the best Nvidia chip in different packaging: China could buy twice as many and get the same result, likely at the same price.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nvidia declined comment on the details about the chip.</p><p>In the paper, published on Saturday, Fist and his co-authors analyzed nine scenarios covering a range of export strategies the administration might take for a downgraded Blackwell chip.</p><p>BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIOS</p><p>In the best scenario, where no powerful chips are exported to China next year, the U.S. would have 30 times the AI computing power of China.</p><p>In the worst, where the U.S. allows the export of the B30A and comparable chips from other U.S. companies, China could surpass the U.S. in terms of how much AI computing power they gain in 2026.</p><p>Even in a median scenario, where a small amount of the chips is exported, the U.S. advantage shrinks to four times China&#39;s computing power, the analysis found.</p><p>&quot;If any meaningful quantities are allowed, it&#39;s a huge change,&quot; said Fist, director of emerging technology policy at the Institute for Progress, a Washington-based think tank. &quot;It&#39;s functionally ending the export control regime that we have today.&quot;</p><p>Chris McGuire, a national security and technology expert who served in the U.S. State Department until last summer, agreed.</p><p>&quot;If this chip is allowed to go, there are effectively no AI chip export controls anymore,&quot; McGuire said. &quot;The reason we have a big advantage on AI is because we have big advantages in computing power and in chips. If we give that away, best case is, it&#39;s like a tie. Worst case, we fall behind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We would be trading China our most advanced technology for soybean purchases,&quot; McGuire said.</p><p>(Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Chris Sanders, Franklin Paul, Daniel Wallis and Deepa Babington)</p></div></article></div>",

(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>A South African court ruled Thursday that the 1967 death of ANC leader and Nobel prize winner Albert Luthuli was due to &quot;assault&quot; by apartheid policemen, overturning a finding that he was struck by a train.</p><p>A formal inquest by the apartheid government claimed in 1967 that Luthuli -- who in 1960 became the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize --&nbsp;had died after being hit by a goods train while walking on a railway line.</p><p>But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa&#39;s government this year reopened inquests into the deaths of several political activists in the struggle against the white-minority apartheid regime, which was removed in 1994.</p><p>&quot;It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with&nbsp;an&nbsp;assault,&quot; Judge Nompumelelo Hadebe ruled.</p><p>The judge said Luthuli&#39;s death was attributable to &quot;assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway&nbsp;Company&quot;.</p><p>She set aside the findings of the 1967 inquest and named seven men, whose whereabouts could &quot;not be ascertained&quot;, as having committed or being complicit in the murder.</p><p>They included a locomotive driver, a fireman, a station master and two railway police officers.</p><p>- Calls for justice -</p><p>Luthuli served as president-general of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1952 until his death and led the anti-apartheid movement during one of its most challenging periods, including its banning by the apartheid government.</p><p>During his Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony in Oslo in 1961, he made a passionate plea for non-violence.</p><p>The ANC in a statement Thursday welcomed a &quot;historic judgement&quot; that &quot;corrects a long-standing distortion of history&quot; by recognising that Luthuli was &quot;a victim of state-sanctioned murder&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;It is a moral victory not only for his family but for all martyrs of our struggle whose lives were cut short by the cruelty of apartheid,&quot; the party said.</p><p>Luthuli&#39;s grandson Sandile Luthuli told local television EWN that the family were

Angeles wildfires at the White House on January 9. - Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview out Thursday, said a frustrating phone call with Joe Biden ahead of her debate with Donald Trump showed her that the former president wasn’t focused on her success – citing it as an example of why she has a “complicated” relationship with Biden.</p><p>“My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself,” she said on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast. “It wasn’t about my performance at the debate.”</p><p>Harris recounted the call, moments before her high-stakes confrontation with Trump, in which Biden told her “a group of people” were speaking poorly of her in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, “because they heard I was saying bad things about him.”</p><p>“I was told that he wanted to call so that I’d be ready,” Harris said. “‘I was so sure it was to buck me up and (say) ‘go get ‘em’ … When I hung up the phone I was just – it was unbelievable, and I was – yes I was angry, and deeply disappointed. It was so unnecessary.”</p><p>The podcast appearance, part of Harris’ media tour promoting her book “107 Days,” marked the former vice president’s latest candid conversation rehashing what happened during her brief and unsuccessful bid for the presidency, as well as the fallout from her loss.</p><p>Harris said she is still friends with Biden, who she said had called her two days earlier for her birthday.</p><p>“I have a great deal of affection for him, and there were times, that I’ve been quite candid about, where he greatly disappointed me and, frankly, angered me,” she said.</p><p>Harris also discussed her perception of Biden’s mental state leading up to his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Trump. Harris said in the interview that she didn’t think Biden actually wanted to hold the early general election debate, but was talked into it.</p><p>“It’s like any competition you go in, whether it’s you’re bidding for something, if it’s sports – you gotta want it, right?” Harris said. “If you don’t want to be in the competition it will absolutely have an impact on your performance, and I don’t think he – I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The former vice president also suggested that she is open to running for president again.</p><p>“I think the case for running again is if I can make a difference,” she said. “If I feel that I can offer something as president of the United States that would be not only uplifting to the American people, but would be about getting us on a correct trajectory.”</p><p>Harris was asked if she thinks she can offer such a message to the country.</p><p>“I mean, that’s why I ran the last time,” she said. “We’ll have to see what happens over the course of these next few months, several months.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

becoming the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value.</p><p>Seoul&#39;s stock market got a lift from tech giant Samsung Electronics posting a 32 percent rise in on-year profits for the third

the US Federal Reserve delivered a second quarter-point rate cut.</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell&#39;s announcement, however, cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar on Wednesday.</p><p>Advertising giant WPP led losses in London, dropping more than 17 percent after it cut its annual outlook.</p><p>Shares in auto giant Stellantis, whose

The system is managed through a digital platform called Origin, which integrates real-time field data, satellite imagery, predictive modeling, and AI-driven invasion mapping, with the goal of streamlining the operation and allowing traceability of every product: “Invasive species are a 21st century ecological crisis whose management cannot be solved with outdated, fragmented approaches,” Chavda said.</p><p>“We are building a completely transparent, traceable and verifiable supply chain, all the way back to the hunting itself.”</p><p>Chavda noted the tanning process is different from using cow hide — especially for fish skin, which is made up of very thin but also very strong fibers.</p><p>He added that Inversa is working with about 50 fashion brands and will soon expand into even more species, which he plans to announce next year. The company mandates that the final products mention either its name or the fact that the leather is sourced from an invasive species, and it states that this method of leather production offers an 89% improvement on carbon emissions and brings land use to almost zero.</p><p>Inversa said that it adheres to humane killing practices and is backed by American nonprofit environmental organization <a href=\"https://www.conservation.org/projects/conservation-international-ventures-llc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Conservation International;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Conservation International </a>and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EkTaS1GnYss7YvVQTQxTEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e7d0bba7f9b809bcdb9815899a66ca20><noscript><img alt=\"These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EkTaS1GnYss7YvVQTQxTEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e7d0bba7f9b809bcdb9815899a66ca20 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst</figcaption></div></figure><p>Chavda said Inversa has removed tens of thousands of invasive animals. However, there is no definitive assessment on the effect of these removals on the habitats: “In the Everglades, we’re seeing anecdotal increases in native mammals in the areas we’re hitting hard, from our hunters. We can definitely tell that the alleviated pressure is helping.”</p><p>Inversa’s work was assessed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Switzerland, which found it had a positive impact on biodiversity.</p><p>“Despite contributing to 60% of species extinctions and causing $423 billion in economic damages annually, invasive species remain largely overlooked in conservation funding,” said Sybille Borner of WWF Switzerland. “The (assessment) highlights Inversa’s ability to fill parts of this critical gap, demonstrating how fashion can be an unexpected yet powerful force for biodiversity.”</p><h3>Raising awareness</h3><p>Alexandra Ioanid, an associate professor at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest, Romania, who has done <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15589250251329539\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">research</a> on invasive species and is not involved with Inversa, said that turning invasive species into a valuable material addresses two challenges at once: “It helps reduce the ecological damage caused by species that threaten native ecosystems, and it offers a more sustainable alternative to conventional leather. Technically, it’s exciting to see that leather made from invasive species can reach the quality and versatility required for real-world use.”</p><p>With the right tanning methods, Ioanid added, these alternative leathers can perform on par with traditional materials — and have a distinctive texture and aesthetic of their own: “If done responsibly, such initiatives can create economic incentives for removing invasive species, support local livelihoods, and contribute to conservation goals. The key is maintaining traceability and ecological oversight to ensure that these materials genuinely help manage invasives rather than encouraging new harvesting.”</p><p>However, selling materials sourced from wildlife, non-native or not, can stimulate markets that promote unrestricted or incentivized killing, encourage intensive wildlife farming and trigger unintended consequences, such as the deliberate release of these species to sustain supply, according to PJ Smith, fashion policy director for Humane World for Animals, a nonprofit that fights animal cruelty.</p><p>“Wildlife conservation efforts should prioritize the development of effective nonlethal management strategies that provide long-term solutions to address negative impacts from non-native species over fueling demand for luxury goods. There is a growing consumer demand for true, sustainable, bio-based leather alternatives that are animal-free and help restore ecosystems without the exploitation,” Smith added.</p><p>Deah Lieurance, an assistant professor of Invasive Species Biology and Management at Penn State University, said that the populations of invasive species that Inversa harvests are so high that she’s doubtful the company could have any significant impact on restoration: “I do think these types of projects do have one major benefit,” she added, “they bring greater public awareness to the wicked problem of biological invasion.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
