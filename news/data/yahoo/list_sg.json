class=caas-body><p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defiantly faced lawmakers Thursday who sought to question her about her family’s past ties to Jeffrey Epstein, insisting that she had no information about the late convicted sex offender’s criminal activities and blasting Republicans for what she termed a faux effort at transparency.</p><p>Clinton insisted in sworn testimony before the House Oversight Committee that she could not recall meeting Epstein, had no knowledge of his crimes and only interacted with a convicted accomplice of his, Ghislaine Maxwell, a handful of times, according to her opening statement and accounts from those in the room. She and other Democrats criticized Republicans, asking why they had not questioned others with ties to Epstein, including President Donald Trump.</p><p>“You have held zero public hearings, refused to allow the media to attend them, including today, despite espousing the need for transparency on dozens of occasions,” Clinton said in her opening statement, which she delivered behind closed doors but also posted publicly.</p><p>The deposition – which took place in New York, near where she lives with former President Bill Clinton, over the course of about six-and-a-half hours – is one of the highest-profile interviews yet in the Republican-led committee’s investigation into Epstein. It comes after both Clintons vigorously resisted testifying in what they denounced as a Republican plot against them, only to reverse course when faced with the prospect of being held in criminal contempt of Congress. Bill Clinton is set to testify Friday.</p><p>By midday, the deposition had already devolved into a rancorous partisan affair. The proceedings had to be paused briefly after conservative podcaster Benny Johnson <a href=\"https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/2027067846417690630?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:posted a photo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">posted a photo</a> from the ongoing interview on X – which Democrats asserted was a violation of House rules. The image, Johnson said, was provided by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert.</p><p>“I admired her blue suit,” the congresswoman quipped to reporters during a break in the proceeding.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Speaking to reporters during that break, Democrats blasted Republicans over the episode and called for members of the media to be allowed in the deposition room.</p><p>“We are sitting through an incredibly unserious clown show of a deposition where members of Congress and the Republican Party are more concerned about getting their photo op of Secretary Clinton than actually getting to the truth and holding anyone accountable,” Arizona Democratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari said.</p><p>While the deposition was not conducted publicly, Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he would try to release video of it within the next 24 hours. The Kentucky Republican said the discussion was “productive” and that he “learned a lot,” but that Hillary Clinton frequently referred questions to her husband, saying, “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask my husband” more than a dozen times.</p><p>“We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow,” Comer said.</p><p>Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said Clinton was “completely cooperating with the deposition and the committee, and is answering questions in full faith and in good faith.” He declined to provide specifics, imploring Republicans to quickly release the full video of the deposition.</p><p>In her opening statement, Clinton sought to make clear she knew nothing of Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>“The Committee justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Let me be as clear as i can. I do not,” Clinton said in the prepared remarks. “I had no idea about their criminal activities. I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes or offices. I have nothing to add to that.”</p><p>Republicans have insisted the Clintons’ testimony is vital to their probe, and noted that neither Bill nor Hillary have answered detailed inquiries about their ties to Epstein.</p><p>“It is a bipartisan investigation. The American people have a lot of questions. To my knowledge, the Clintons haven’t answered very many if any questions about their knowledge or involvement with Epstein and Maxwell,” Comer said.</p><p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said at a press briefing after the deposition that Clinton “took every question from every single member.” During the interview, she asked Clinton a number of questions about her husband, including whether the former first lady had any feelings about young women massaging him, according to a source who watched the deposition. Clinton responded she would not speculate about events for which she was not present and was not there to discuss feelings.</p><p>Bill Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and a spokesperson has repeatedly said he cut ties before Epstein’s arrest on federal charges in 2019 and was unaware of any crimes.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8DblPGG6zoeTH.688Fqixw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2d1c4610d6e1634619522e50638c7415><noscript><img alt=\"House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8DblPGG6zoeTH.688Fqixw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2d1c4610d6e1634619522e50638c7415 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>House Oversight Chairman James Comer and Republican members speak to the press at the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in Chappaqua, New York, on February 26, 2026. - David Dee Delgado/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>A CNN review showed the former president traveled on Epstein’s private plane at least 16 times, and he was pictured in Epstein case files released by the Justice Department with women in a jacuzzi, as well as with Maxwell.</p><p>Hillary Clinton was accompanied Thursday by her attorneys, who have been working through painstaking details of what areas could be covered during questioning.</p><p>Even the location for the depositions, the Clintons’ hometown of Chappaqua, was negotiated between Clinton lawyer David Kendall and Comer in hopes of avoiding the indignity and precedent-setting move of summoning a former president to Capitol Hill for questioning.</p><p>The former first lady arrived out of direct sight of the gaggle of reporters who had gathered in front of the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center. But the two images of Clinton flanked by her attorneys that surfaced on social media during the proceeding briefly ground the deposition to a halt, with Democratic lawmakers accusing their Republican colleagues of breaking their own rules.</p><p>The Clintons and members of the House Oversight Committee agreed to five topic areas for the depositions, a person familiar with the agreement told CNN. They were:</p><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p>alleged mismanagement of the federal government’s investigation into Epstein and Maxwell;</p></li><li><p>the circumstances and subsequent investigations of Epstein’s 2019 death;</p></li><li><p>the ways the federal government could effectively combat sex-trafficking rings;</p></li><li><p>how Epstein and Maxwell sought to curry favor to protect their illegal activities;</p></li><li><p>and potential violations of ethics rules related to elected officials.</p></li></ul><p>Survivors of Epstein’s abuse and lawyers representing them told CNN that they believe it is important for the Clintons, and especially the former president, to testify. In interviews, they stressed that the presence of an individual in the Epstein files and their cooperation with Congress does not indicate wrongdoing.</p><p><em>This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p>CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Cuba said four people on board were killed, with another six wounded.</p><p>The incident came amid deep tensions between Havana and Washington following the US overthrow of top Cuba ally, Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela.</p><p>Cuba vowed to defend itself against &quot;terrorist and mercenary&quot; attacks after the fatal exchange of fire with the Florida-registered boat.</p><p>On Thursday, Cuba&#39;s deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio said Washington had &quot;expressed willingness to cooperate in clarifying these regrettable events.&quot;</p><p>Havana said all those on board the US boat were Cubans living in the United States, which has received several waves of emigration from the island since the 1960s.</p><p>A political ally of one of those killed, Michel Ortega Casanova, told AFP that Ortega Casanova had spoken often of wanting to free his homeland.</p><p>&quot;His goal was to go and fight against a criminal and murderous narco-tyrannical (government), to see if that would spark the people to rise up,&quot; said Wilfredo Beyra, head of the Cuban Republican Party in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Beyra said he had warned Ortega Casanova, reported to be a 54-year-old truck driver, now was &quot;not the time to take such action&quot; but that the other man had vowed to take action &quot;at any moment.&quot;</p><p>Cuban authorities said a coast guard vessel came under fire from the speedboat around one nautical mile from Cuba&#39;s north shore, adding that assault rifles, handguns, Molotov cocktails and military-style gear were all found onboard.</p><p>The response from the United States government was muted.</p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was on a Caribbean visit, said that Washington was conducting its own investigation and would &quot;respond accordingly.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He insisted that the US government had no hand in the confrontation.</p><p>- Fighting for the homeland &nbsp;-</p><p>The interior ministry said most of those on the speedboat had records in Cuba for &quot;criminal and violent activity,&quot; and that another man sent from the United States to take part in the operation was arrested on Cuban soil and confessed.</p><p>A US official also said some on the boat had criminal records, and added that a US citizen who was injured was receiving medical care in Cuba.</p><p>Beyra told AFP that several groups in Florida, home to over one million Cubans, &quot;openly declare that they are willing, through military training, to fight for the freedom of their homeland.&quot;</p><p>He said he also knew one of the men identified by Havana as being wounded, Leordan Enrique Cruz Gomez, whom he met at a political event.</p><p>The Cuban government frequently reports incursions by speedboats from the United States into its territorial waters, but deadly clashes are rarer.</p><p>Incursion incidents are often related to people-smuggling to the United States or drug trafficking, and have included chases, shootouts and armed attacks on border guards.</p><p>- Trump pressure -</p><p>The latest clash comes as Cuba reels from US economic pressure.</p><p>President Donald Trump has branded Cuba a &quot;failed nation&quot; and an &quot;extraordinary threat&quot; to US national security, though he has so far dismissed mounting a regime change operation.</p><p>Cuba&#39;s communist government lost one of its key diplomatic supporters -- and a vital source of fuel for the country -- in January when US forces toppled Maduro, effectively taking control of Venezuelan oil exports.</p><p>The country had previously relied on Venezuela for about half of its fuel needs.</p><p>After an outcry from Caribbean leaders, worried that starving 9.6 million Cubans of oil would cause the economy to collapse, the United States said Wednesday it would allow limited shipments of Venezuelan oil for commercial and humanitarian use.</p><p>The Treasury Department said the Venezuelan oil would need to go through private businesses and not the Cuban government or the military apparatus that controls much of the island&#39;s economy.</p><p>burs/cb/aha/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

visited his island or flown on his plane, accusing the panel of trying to &quot;protect one public official&quot; -- Trump.</p><p>James&nbsp;Comer, who chairs the committee that will also grill former

&quot;if this committee is serious about learning the truth about Epstein&#39;s trafficking crimes...it would ask (Trump) directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the

In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory ⁠burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p><p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government&#39;s commerce ministry.</p><p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p><p>The enforcement push is also legal ​and ​bureaucratic. Since China enacted its Export Control Law in October 2020, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared ​to just six times between 2015-2020.</p><p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this ‌year&#39;s national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while Beijing has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p><p>Beijing&#39;s October 2025 revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows Washington to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p><p>&quot;China&#39;s use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said Li Xing, professor at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, a think tank in Guangzhou.</p><p>China dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself.</p><p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p><p>&quot;This is not just a ‌supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said Nick Myers, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p><p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p><p>During ​Trump&#39;s first term and under President Joe Biden, the United States rapidly expanded export controls targeting China.</p><p>Annual China-related additions to the Entity List, which ​requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 ​to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.</p><p>Since Trump&#39;s return to office, that trajectory has reversed. China-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in ‌2025, roughly half the previous year&#39;s pace.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, ​an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese ​tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p><p>The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department&#39;s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official said the list was removed as it may require changes based on new information and that an updated list would be published, without further elaborating.</p><p>The moderation has drawn criticism from bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, who have faulted the administration for ​approving certain <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nvidia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nvidia</a> AI chip exports and cutting BIS funding.</p><p>A Nvidia spokesperson said in ‌a statement that criticism of the current administration&#39;s decision to greenlight these semiconductor shipments to China was unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors.</p><p>&quot;America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and ​approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America&#39;s lead in AI,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who criticised Biden-era controls, said last year that &quot;export control was ​a failure&quot; and that Trump &quot;realises it&#39;s exactly the wrong goal.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)</p></div></article></div>",

It’s particularly notable given past claims that Paxton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/27/politics/ken-paxton-impeachment-texas-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:asked a campaign donor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">asked a campaign donor</a> to hire someone with whom he was having an affair, allegations that were cited by the Texas House in impeaching Paxton in 2023. He was later acquitted by the Texas Senate.</p><p>His wife, Angela Paxton – a state senator and longtime political adviser – accused him of adultery and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/ken-paxton-divorce-texas-senate?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed for divorce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">filed for divorce</a> last year on “biblical grounds.”</p><p>A Paxton adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said the ad featuring Hayworth was filmed before Cornyn released an ad that has drawn wide attention, though Paxton’s campaign intended for its video to respond to Cornyn’s.</p><p>The Cornyn Lonestar Victory Fund, a joint effort between the Cornyn campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leveled a series of attacks against Paxton. CNN could not verify all of the ad’s claims.</p><p>“It’s voting time, so let’s cut through the bulls**t,” the ad’s narrator begins. “Crooked Ken Paxton cheated on his wife. She’s divorcing him on ‘biblical grounds.’”</p><p>“Now, think of the Paxton dirty deeds we don’t know about yet,” the narrator adds.</p><p>In the op-ed published Thursday, Hayworth accused Paxton’s opponents of “ugly attacks” on her father.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“When his opponent can’t win on policy, he goes after character,” Hayworth wrote. “But anyone who has spent real time with my dad knows that the attacks bear no resemblance to the man they claim to describe.”</p><p>Paxton has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/ken-paxton-texas-senate-republican-primary?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:survived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">survived</a> a series of controversies throughout his time as the state’s attorney general, including a felony securities fraud investigation that was ultimately settled.</p><p>“We overcame them all,” he told reporters last week.</p><p>Cornyn and his allies have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/politics/texas-senate-primary-cornyn-paxton-hunt-crockett-talarico?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warned nominating Paxton;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warned nominating Paxton</a> to the top of the Republican ticket in November would endanger GOP chances in the traditionally red-voting state.</p><p>“We will have an election day massacre,” Cornyn said earlier this month. “If Ken Paxton is at the top of the ticket, we risk losing the Senate seat, losing the majority in the House of Representatives, and it will take a toll on everybody in the ballot.”</p><p>In a statement, Paxton said, “Unlike John Cornyn, who’s become a desperate shell of a man clinging to power, my campaign is not about attacking someone else’s family. It’s about protecting America.”</p><p>The three-way GOP field could result in a late May runoff between the top two finishers if no candidate is able to clear the 50% vote threshold next week.</p><p>A University of Houston Hobby School poll conducted in late January found Paxton leading the field among likely voters. Paxton earned 38% support compared to 31% for Cornyn and Hunt at 17%. 12% of those polled said they were undecided.</p><p>One of the biggest question marks in the race is whether President Donald Trump will decide to support a candidate. Trump, who is traveling to Corpus Christi on Friday, has so far withheld an endorsement.</p><p>“I just haven’t made a decision on that race yet. It’s got a ways to go,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “They’ve all supported me. They’re all good, and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens. But I support all three involved.”</p><p>CNN’s Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

New Zealand through natural disasters, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2019 Christchurch mosque massacre.</p><p>But plaudits abroad did not always match her support at home, which dipped towards the end of her second term in office driven by deteriorating economic conditions and a backlash to her government&#39;s strict Covid policies.</p><p>The former prime minister is now among thousands of her

New research says it&#39;s a tale as old as time.</p><p>A study out Thursday in Science argues that Neanderthal men and human women were particularly inclined to mate, a sexual habit that offers insight into the evolution of the modern human genome.</p><p>In 2010 scientists reconstructed the Neanderthal genome -- blockbuster research that allowed for analysis making clear that the species interbred.</p><p>Most people living today have some residual fragments of DNA from our ancient evolutionary cousins.</p><p>Research indicates both groups descended from a population living in Africa some million years ago.</p><p>They eventually diverged, with anatomically modern humans evolving in Africa, and Neanderthals migrating across Eurasia.</p><p>But over hundreds of millenia, human migrations resulted in interbreeding, researchers say.</p><p>Yet humans have little to no Neanderthal DNA on our X chromosomes -- one of two human chromosomes that determines an embryo&#39;s sex.</p><p>That was assumed to be the result of a natural selection.</p><p>The genes were biologically &quot;toxic&quot; to humans, researchers hypothesized, and eventually purged out -- in essence, the children who inherited those traits might not have lived to pass them on.</p><p>But the new study from geneticists at the University of Pennsylvania suggests the phenomenon has more social origins, and were actually the result of &quot;long-standing mating preferences.&quot;</p><p>The team analyzed modern human DNA preserved in Neanderthals, and found an abundance on the X chromosome -- the mirror opposite of humans.</p><p>That result allowed them to rule out that reproduction between the species was incompatible.</p><p>Instead the gene flow &quot;occurred predominantly between Neanderthal males and anatomically modern human females,&quot; said Alexander Platt, a senior research scientist on the study.</p><p>Since females have two X chromosomes and males just one, the math adds up: If Neanderthal males and modern human females were mating, more Neanderthal X chromosomes would enter the human gene pool, and vice versa.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Researchers said that sex-biased migration could also offer clues. But ancient mating habits &quot;provided the simplest explanation,&quot; Platt said.</p><p>The larger &quot;why&quot; is unknown: Neanderthal men and modern human women might have been mating by choice, or violence and coercion could have been involved.</p><p>Researchers say they now hope to analyze the development of this mating pattern.</p><p>Possibilities include probing gender dynamics within Neanderthal society, or migration habits -- perhaps males were likely to leave their societies while females stayed with their families, for example.</p><p>mdo/bgs</p></div></article></div>",
