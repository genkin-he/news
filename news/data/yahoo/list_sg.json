become a &quot;consolation prize&quot; for Russian President Vladimir Putin amid intense efforts to end the Ukraine war.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya said it was crucial for Ukraine to win its battle but that Belarus, a close ally of Moscow under current leader President Alexander Lukashenko, should not be sacrificed.</p><p>&quot;It is important for us that Europe represents the Belarusian voice during these negotiations as well, that we don&#39;t separate the Ukrainian and Belarusian case, that Belarus is not given as a consolation prize to Putin,&quot; she said on the sidelines of a visit to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</p><p>Ukrainian and US negotiators held fresh talks in Geneva on Thursday on efforts to end Russia&#39;s invasion, now into a fifth year. Further Ukraine-Russia-US talks could be held in Abu Dhabi in March, according to Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Russia is demanding Ukraine pull its troops out of territory Kyiv&#39;s army still controls -- a proposal Zelensky has rejected -- and said there is no deadline for ending the conflict.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya said that if Russia succeeded with its conditions, &quot;it will keep the status quo in Belarus for decades, and Belarus can be used as a launching pad, as a place for escalating deployment of different types of weapons, threatening, blackmailing (its) neighbours for years and years ahead&quot;.</p><p>Russia used Belarusian territory to launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, announced in December that Russian ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons had been stationed in his country.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya, now 43, stood against Lukashenko in a 2020 presidential election that the opposition say she won.</p><p>Official results however awarded the victory to Lukashenko, triggering major demonstrations and a brutal crackdown, forcing Tikhanovskaya into exile.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Strong cards&#39; -</p><p>Tikhanovskaya originally went to Lithuania but confirmed that she is moving to Warsaw.</p><p>Lithuanian officials lowered her security status last year and several of the opposition leader&#39;s associates said the Belarus government had made threats.</p><p>&quot;I personally lived in Vilnius for five years. Honestly I was always sure that the next city I would move from Vilnius would be Minsk. But the situation is like it is,&quot; she said.</p><p>She now campaigns for the estimated 1,200 political prisoners in Belarus while planning for ways to change the country, and also jointly works with the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog that counts 46 countries as members.</p><p>She would like the European Union to toughen its sanctions against Lukashenko&#39;s government over its role in the Ukraine war.</p><p>&quot;I want to explain to the Europeans that they have such strong cards... to help us to release the country,&quot; said Tikhanovskaya.</p><p>The Belarus people want to be &quot;European&quot;, she added, while admitting that its 30 years under Lukashenko&#39;s rule would make it difficult to quickly gain EU membership.</p><p>&quot;A huge shift took place in minds of the people&quot; with the 2020 demonstrations, she said.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s impossible to turn this page of our history.

That’s a reflection of increased polarization and shows that justices within the standard conservative and liberal blocs often splinter in their legal reasoning and approach.</p><p>Roberts’ opinion for the majority in the tariffs dispute was an efficient 21 pages. The principal dissenting opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, stretched to 63 pages. But then four other justices, who’d sided with Roberts, wrote concurring opinions: Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The most expansive came from Gorsuch, at 46 pages. Clarence Thomas added a separate dissenting opinion.</p><p>The writings totaled 164 pages, with another six for the accompanying syllabus.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“I felt very left out in the tariffs case,” Alito told Bursch drolly. “Justice Sotomayor didn’t write and I didn’t write.”</p><p>Rejoined Sonia Sotomayor, as the others chuckled, “Maybe we’ll have a chance here.”</p><p>Quips aside, the competing views in the dispute over Trump’s assertion of unilateral power for tariffs on foreign goods surprised the legal community.</p><p>“I was struck with just how many and how long the separate opinions were,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith. “Justice Gorsuch’s opinion was notable for pointedly throwing down the gauntlet, at his colleagues, which had the effect making all of them feel they had to write more in response.”</p><h3>Why justices are writing more</h3><p>In prior decades, justices tended to write concurring opinions to make clear the limits of a majority ruling, said Galbraith, an international law scholar who earlier served as a law clerk to the late Justice John Paul Stevens.</p><p>“Concurrences these days are often being used for big brush strokes,” she said, “for laying out and defending broad judicial philosophies. That’s what was going on in the tariff opinions.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A portion of the opening text in the US Supreme Court&#x002019;s decision in Learning Resources Inc. v.

He said the court averaged roughly 64 concurrences per 100 majority opinions in 2000–2009, compared to about 80 per 100 opinions in 2019–2024, with a pronounced rise since the mid-2010s.</p><p>For years, Thomas led the court in such supplemental writings as he laid out his distinct conservative approach to the Constitution. The newest justice, Jackson, on the left wing, is now close to rivaling Thomas.</p><p>Since 2022 when she joined the bench, Jackson has authored 29 concurring opinions, Feldman found, topped only by Thomas at 35 concurrences for the same period.</p><p>For comparison, at the other end of the spectrum, the liberal Kagan penned just five concurrences over the past three-and-a-half years. Roberts, who controls many of the court’s most important opinions, wrote only one concurring statement.</p><h3>Justices increasingly spar in the footnotes</h3><p>An otherwise little-noticed January dispute over federal court procedure illustrated Jackson’s tendency. Barrett had the majority in the case, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-440_1b82.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Berk v. Choy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Berk v. Choy</a>, and wrote an 11-page decision signed by all other justices but Jackson.</p><p>Jackson agreed with Barrett’s conclusion that a Delaware affidavit requirement for medical malpractice cases does not apply in federal court. But she strongly disagreed with the Barrett majority over which rules of civil procedure applied.</p><p>Jackson laid out her reasoning, across 13 pages and six footnotes, some of which tussled with Barrett over how each was interpreting (or “contorting”) the rules.</p><p>At one point, Jackson asserted that a Barrett assumption “jumps the gun.” Barrett responded with a footnote asserting, “we do not ‘jump the gun,’ but rather cut to the chase.”</p><p>All seven of the justices who wrote opinions in the tariff dispute last Friday dropped asides in the footnotes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-tariffs-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Roberts trained his fire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Roberts trained his fire</a> on Kavanaugh’s dissent, noting that Kavanaugh had suggested Trump could impose “most if not all” of the disputed tariffs under statutes other than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p><p>Responded Roberts: “We do not speculate on hypothetical cases not before us.”</p><p>Later, as he rejected Kavanaugh’s reliance on a 1981 case, Roberts insisted that the court had stressed the narrowness of that ruling at least five times in its opinion. “That is not quite ‘no, no, a thousand times no,’ but should have sufficed to dissuade” Kavanaugh from using it.</p><h3>Major questions for one another</h3><p>Much of the separate writing in the tariffs case addressed how a legal approach known as “the major questions doctrine” should be applied. The theory holds that if Congress wants to delegate significant economic or political power to the president, it must do so clearly in a statute.</p><p>Roberts concluded that Congress had not granted such tariff power under IEEPA, as Trump had claimed.</p><p>“(T)he President must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,” Roberts wrote.</p><p>Gorsuch agreed with Roberts’ take but then used the occasion to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-major-questions-doctrine-gorsuch-kavanaugh-kagan?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:criticize other justices’ approaches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">criticize other justices’ approaches</a> to interpreting statutes under the major questions doctrine, largely based on their past writings.</p><p>Barrett fired back that Gorsuch was mischaracterizing her position, saying, “he takes down a straw man. I have never espoused that view.”</p><p>Kagan, a critic of the constraints imposed by the “major questions” approach, noted in her separate writing that Gorsuch was “insisting that I now must be applying the major-questions doctrine, and his own version of it to boot. Given how strong his apparent desire for converts, I almost regret to inform him that I am not one.”</p><p>The desire for converts can indeed motivate a lengthy concurrence. As much as the justices were, by turns, relitigating past cases and defending their positions in the dispute at hand, they were laying out the groundwork for future cases.</p><p>As Gorsuch remarked as he closed out his 46 pages, “if history is any guide, the tables will turn….”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

A push for U.S. datacentres to use their own power will boost demand for Wartsila&#39;s more environmentally friendly products and ‌help underpin a &quot;double-digit&quot; percentage increase in hiring of servicing staff over the next two ‌years, the Finnish energy company&#39;s CEO told Reuters.</p><p>The White House said on Wednesday it would meet with tech companies, such as ​<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/microsoft/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Microsoft;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Microsoft</a>, Amazon and Meta, on March 4 to agree a plan to protect consumers from rising power costs tied to surging demand for AI-focused datacenters.</p><p>The issue is proving a hot-button topic ahead of the U.S. mid-term elections later this year, alongside growing concerns around environmental impacts such as water usage and pollution.</p><p>While demand ‌was already strong, Wartsila expects to ⁠grow its delivery capacity for datacentre engines 80% by 2028, and the U.S. moves would provide a further tailwind for its more energy- and water-efficient products, Hakan ⁠Agnevall said.</p><p>&quot;So far we&#39;ve contracted for about 1.2 gigawatts of power for datacentres,&quot; Agnevall said, recalling &quot;one particular situation where it was a very important factor for choosing our technology&quot;.</p><p>Datacentres increasingly rely on gas or diesel generators ​to ​provide backup power to avoid taxing the electrical grid, ​but some can use a lot of ‌fuel and water to keep cool.</p><p>With a closed-loop cooling system, Wartsila&#39;s engine technology consumed &quot;up to 2,000 times less water&quot; than rivals&#39; comparable gas turbines, while its engines create lower emissions and can cut fuel costs by 20-35%, the company said.</p><p>Earlier in February, the Finland-based company, which also sells engines to the marine industry, among others, missed fourth-quarter order forecasts but said datacentres were a bright spot.</p><p>The U.S. market ‌is home to around half the world&#39;s datacentres and growth ​is expected to surge over the next few years as ​companies race to scale computing power, in ​turn fuelling competition for workers.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Agnevall said around half of the company&#39;s revenues currently ‌come from servicing its engines once they are ​installed, and it has ​around 1,000 U.S.-based staff, a figure which could see double-digit growth over the next two years.</p><p>To ensure there are enough staff, though, Agnevall urged an increase in vocational training opportunities in ​the country.</p><p>&quot;Everybody&#39;s looking for that type ‌of talent,&quot; Agnevall said. &quot;There is a strong demand... in the U.S., (but) there has, so ​far at least, been tight supply.

This move will also ensure that NSmen with the relevant cyber skillsets are meaningfully deployed in key operational roles, the ministry added.</p><p>The ministry also announced on Feb 27 that the first phase of the SAF’s digital range will be operational in 2026, with an upgraded Cyber Defence Test and Experimentation Centre (CyTEC) that is able to simulate sophisticated cyber defence scenarios using artificial intelligence.</p><p>Akin to how a live-firing range hones soldiers’ warfighting capabilities, the digital range is meant to be a training environment for cyber defenders.</p><p>Mindef said that the digital range will initially build on the existing CyTEC building.

neighbours at &quot;open war&quot; following months of tit-for-tat clashes.</p><p>AFP reporters in Kabul and Kandahar heard blasts and jets overhead until dawn.</p><p>The operation was Pakistan&#39;s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first airstrikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Near the key Torkham border crossing between the two countries, an AFP journalist heard shelling on Friday morning, and a camp accommodating Afghans returning from Pakistan was hit by the fighting overnight.</p><p>&quot;Children, women, and old people were running,&quot; Gander Khan, a 65-year-old returnee, told AFP in front of rows of tents at the Omari camp.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s latest operation came after Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops on Thursday night in retaliation for earlier air strikes by Islamabad.</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Most of the attacks have been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has stepped up assaults in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s defence minister Khawaja Asif declared an &quot;all-out confrontation&quot; with the Taliban government, posting on X: &quot;Now it is open war between us and you.&quot;</p><p>- Delicate ceasefire broken -</p><p>The overnight strikes mark a &quot;significant and dangerous escalation from earlier clashes&quot;, South Asia expert Michael Kugelman said on X.</p><p>&quot;Pakistan appears to have expanded its targeting beyond TTP to the Taliban regime itself,&quot; he said.</p><div

agreement.</p><p>After repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.</p><p>Iran, which shares an eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, on Friday offered to help &quot;facilitate dialogue&quot;, while Saudi&#39;s foreign minister spoke with his Pakistani counterpart and China said it was &quot;working with&quot; both countries while calling for calm.</p><p>Both the Afghan and Pakistani militaries said they killed dozens of soldiers in recent border violence, which followed multiple strikes by Islamabad on Afghanistan and clashes along the frontier in recent months.</p><p>- Jets overhead -</p><p>In the Afghan capital, AFP journalists heard jets and multiple loud blasts, followed by gunfire over a period of several hours.</p><p>An AFP reporter in Kandahar, where Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada is based, said he also heard jets overhead.</p><p>Streets in Kabul were quiet after daybreak, in keeping with a Friday during Ramadan in the Muslim-majority nation.</p><p>The Taliban government confirmed the Pakistan air strikes, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid saying there were no casualties.</p><p>Hours earlier, Mujahid announced &quot;large-scale offensive operations&quot; at the border &quot;in response to repeated violations by the Pakistani military&quot;.</p><p>The Afghan defence ministry reported eight of its soldiers had been killed in the land offensive.</p><p>At the camp for returnees near Torkham, multiple civilians were wounded in a Pakistan strike, an Afghan official reported.</p><p>&quot;A mortar shell has hit the camp and unfortunately seven of our refugees have been wounded,&quot; said Qureshi Badlun, the information chief in Nangarhar province.</p><p>- Months of border violence -</p><p>Mujahid, the Taliban government spokesman, told AFP that several Pakistani soldiers had been &quot;caught alive&quot;, a claim denied by the prime minister&#39;s office in Islamabad.</p><p>The military operation follows recent Pakistan strikes on Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, which the UN mission in Afghanistan said killed at least 13 civilians.</p><p>Both sides also reported cross-border fire on Tuesday, but without casualties.</p><p>Besides military operations, there has been a series of deadly suicide blasts in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent months.</p><p>They included an attack on a Shiite mosque in Islamabad&nbsp;that killed at least 40 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group.</p><p>The militant group&#39;s regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a restaurant in Kabul last month.</p><p>Friday&#39;s air strikes almost immediately sparked misinformation online, with a video of a large explosion racking up more than one million views within hours.</p><p>AFP fact-checkers found the footage -- shared in English, Indonesian, Greek, Turkish and Arabic-language social media posts -- was taken during the start of the Iraq War in 2003.</p><p>burs-je/fox</p></div></article></div>",

investments.</p><p>After surging for the past two years on a rush into all things linked to artificial intelligence, Wall Street&#39;s Magnificent Seven tech titans have been slow out of the blocks this year amid concerns about extended valuations and profitability.</p><p>Worries about the impact of new tools that many warn pose a risk to a range of companies were compounded by a report on Sunday that signified parts of the global economy that could be at risk from the new gadgets, including credit card and food delivery firms.</p><p>That uncertainty has seen a shift from &quot;downstream&quot; companies that run apps and software to &quot;upstream&quot; firms such as chipmakers, many of which are based in Asia.</p><p>That was highlighted this week by another Wall Street sell-off, despite Nvidia reporting quarterly profits more than doubled, projecting more strong growth for the coming period.</p><p>Analysts said the losses showed firms needed to far exceed even elevated forecasts, making it even harder to please investors who have been piling into tech in recent years.</p><p>&quot;Market expectations were already very elevated and part of the positive results had been priced in,&quot; said City Index&#39;s Julian Pineda.</p><p>&quot;There are also concerns related to stretched valuations and Nvidia’s dependence on capital spending by large technology companies investing in AI infrastructure.</p><p>&quot;If the pace of AI investment moderates due to cost optimisation efforts, it could indirectly affect Nvidia&#39;s growth outlook.&quot;</p><p>Most of Wall Street fell, with the Nasdaq shedding more than one percent.</p><p>Asia started off mixed but went into the home straight on a broadly positive note, with the Supreme Court&#39;s decision last Friday to slap down many of US President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs seen largely benefiting regional economies.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

Wellington all advanced.</p><p>But Seoul sank one percent, having chalked up gains of more than eight percent this week thanks to a surge in market heavyweights Samsung and SK hynix.</p><p>Manila, Mumbai and Jakarta also slipped.</p><p>London opened higher, Paris fell and Frankfurt was flat.</p><p>The yen extended a minor recovery against the dollar after a top Bank of Japan board member again urged officials to continue hiking interest rates.</p><p>However, the case for a pause was boosted by data showing Tokyo&#39;s inflation -- seen as a barometer for the country -- cooled last month.</p><p>The currency came under pressure this week after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi nominated two academics to the BoJ board who are considered policy doves, days after reports said she had told its boss Kazuo Ueda of her concern about tightening further.</p><p>Oil prices rose as investors kept tabs on Iran nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Mediators said the two sides had made &quot;significant progress&quot; in talks Thursday in Switzerland as they look to avert a war in the crude-rich Middle East. Officials agreed to further discussions next week in Austria.</p><p>The Oman-mediated negotiations follow repeated threats from Trump to strike Tehran, with the US president last Thursday giving it 15 days to reach a deal.</p><p>- Key figures at around 0815 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.2 percent at 58,850.27 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.0 percent at 26,630.54 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.4 percent at 4,162.88 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: UP 0.2&nbsp;percent at 10,867.49</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 156.03 yen from 156.11 yen on Thursday</p><p>Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1818 from $1.1799</p><p>Pound/dollar: UP at $1.3493 from $1.3489</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 87.59 pence from 87.47 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: UP 0.8 percent at $65.75 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: UP 0.7&nbsp;percent at $71.22 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP less than 0.1 percent at 49,499.20 (close)</p><p>dan/lga</p></div></article></div>",

traded on the glamour of owning Harrods, the Paris Ritz and luxury yachts, but Mohamed Al-Fayed was at the centre of a dark web of alleged abuse, say French lawyers for women who liken him to US

abuse on French soil.</p><p>&quot;Every time I met Mohamed Al-Fayed, he tried to assault me,&quot; his former personal assistant Kristina Svensson told French police of her two years working at the Ritz.</p><p>Her testimony is all too familiar.</p><p>The alleged crimes of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who died in 2023 aged 94, first came to light in a BBC investigation in September 2024. In it, several young women who worked at his upmarket London department store Harrods accused him of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>British police told AFP that 154 victims have so far come forward to say the former owner of Premier League club Fulham abused them.</p><p>His brother Salah, who died in 2010, is also accused.</p><p>But frustrated by London Metropolitan Police&#39;s investigation of the alleged crimes, which span more than 35 years, some victims have turned to France in the hope of finding justice.</p><p>&quot;In England they&#39;re ignoring the trafficking... They just want to make it about Al-Fayed and Harrods,&quot; said Rachael Louw, a former Al-Fayed employee, speaking for the first time about her ordeal.</p><p>The French investigation, however, is handled by &quot;a unit specialised in human trafficking,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>It is &quot;a relief that our cases are actually being recognised as trafficking&quot;.</p><p>- Consumed &#39;like meat&#39; -</p><p>Louw was 23 when her bosses sent her to Salah Fayed&#39;s yacht on the French Riviera. Now after 31 years she was able to testify about what happened there to French investigators on February 10.</p><p>Louw told AFP she was first &quot;spotted&quot; by Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1993 while working as a sales assistant at Harrods. Shortly after, she was placed on a management training scheme, which required her to submit to a medical exam by a Harley Street doctor before being employed by the chairman&#39;s office in the summer of 1994.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The medical appointment went far beyond a standard checkup, with a pelvic exam and &quot;thorough breast exam&quot;, smear and HIV tests.</p><p>And the results were not kept confidential.</p><p>The report, seen by AFP, was handed over to Harrods, and described Louw&#39;s personal life: her parents&#39; separation when she was young, her father living in the United States and the death of her mother and grandmother.</p><p>The doctor also noted that she took a birth control pill, had a boyfriend and was in &quot;excellent&quot; health.</p><p>The doctor &quot;sent confidential information to arm the rapist&quot;, said French lawyer Eva Joly, who is representing Louw and another former Al-Fayed assistant.</p><p>&quot;These young women were like meat, and they wanted to know if they were fit to consume,&quot; said Caroline Joly, another member of the legal team.</p><p>Several encounters were arranged between Louw and Salah Fayed at his home in London&#39;s glitzy Park Lane, where Louw said she was drugged with &quot;a crack cocaine mix&quot;.</p><p>Louw was then offered a job as an assistant to Salah in France and she was sent there by private jet.</p><p>She said she refused further drugs, &quot;and because he didn&#39;t push anymore, I thought it was okay&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;no&nbsp;reason&nbsp;not to trust&nbsp;this&nbsp;man... this&nbsp;was&nbsp;my&nbsp;first job&nbsp;from&nbsp;university.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;I didn&#39;t feel safe&#39; -</p><p>Staff confiscated her passport as she flew from London&#39;s Luton airport to his yacht. And once she arrived, &quot;nothing&quot; resembled the job she signed up for.</p><p>&quot;I thought I was supposed to be filing paperwork, making arrangements, organising office work,&quot; she said.</p><p>Instead &quot;there was no office, no normal working hours, no time off. I was expected to just be with him&quot;, she said.</p><p>Louw recalled appearing alongside Salah Fayed at dinners attended by elderly, wealthy men with &quot;young girls and lots of touching&quot;.</p><p>When she managed to call her boyfriend, who worked at Harrods, he was fired.</p><p>One night, Louw woke up to find Salah in her bed, claiming he was lonely, she said.</p><p>&quot;I went ramrod straight and the rest of the night I was awake just lying there petrified,&quot; she said, fearing any movement would be an invitation for him to touch her.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know what he would do to me... I didn&#39;t feel safe.&quot;</p><p>She saw other young women in the Fayeds&#39; orbit.</p><p>On a trip to Saint Tropez she encountered a red-headed &quot;young girl&quot;, possibly younger than herself, sunbathing on Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s yacht that was moored just off his villa. </p><p>&quot;Mohamed starts rubbing lotion all over this girl, she&#39;s wearing a bathing suit and then he started to kiss her,&quot; Louw told AFP.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything else&quot; of that day, she said, &quot;so I don&#39;t know if there were drugs, I can&#39;t say for sure whether I was drugged that afternoon,&quot; she added.</p><p>What jolted her to escape was the prospect of being trapped alone with Salah after he bought a speedboat with only one bedroom, telling her &quot;that he would take me to sail around the Italian coast&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I knew that if I went on that boat nothing good would happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Panicked, she booked the first Air France flight out and worked up the courage to ask for her passport back, which she received although it was clear Salah &quot;was very angry&quot;.</p><p>Home again, &quot;I had&nbsp;blocked out&quot; the details of what happened, she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to&nbsp;remember.&quot;</p><p>For decades she feared she was bound by a confidentiality agreement she had signed at her interview, but seeing other victims speak out against Al-Fayed in 2024, she reconsidered.</p><p>&quot;How can I be silent?&nbsp;There has to be a cost to what the perpetrators did. Because if they go unpunished, it emboldens the next man.</p><p>&quot;If we women do not speak up we become complicit in our own oppression... powerful men will never change a system that benefits them.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Organised system&#39; -</p><p>Despite the deaths of the brothers, the women hope investigators can still track down who enabled the trafficking network.</p><p>&quot;There is no such thing as a small piece of information. Every element is useful for the investigation,&quot; Al-Fayed assistant Svensson said, calling on victims and witnesses to speak to police.</p><p>The Swedish woman arrived in France in 1993 and was placed by a temp agency at the Ritz in 1998, then owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed, as his assistant.</p><p>Svensson, aged 30 at the time, was to help him manage his affairs after the death of his son Dodi with Princess Diana in a Paris car crash, perceived as a prestigious assignment.</p><p>During her interview with the Ritz management, the questions posed were &quot;focused&quot; on her appearance and her personal background, she said, even pointing out that she was the &quot;spitting image&quot; of Al-Fayed&#39;s wife.</p><p>The Ritz then sent her to Harrods in London for an interview with Al-Fayed himself, and organised&nbsp;accommodation for her at a luxury residence he owned.</p><p>&quot;I had brought my CV. He wasn&#39;t interested in that. He only asked me personal questions.&quot;</p><p>What followed was a regular pattern of meetings with Al-Fayed. Svensson said she was left in a room alone for hours with no instruction, until he eventually arrived and she would endure sexual assault and attempted rape during which &quot;he&#39;d laugh&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hoped that in time he would see that I wasn&#39;t interested in him and that he would take me seriously,&quot; Svensson told police.</p><p>&quot;I was a foreigner, with no family or network in the country, no knowledge of French labour law, and no one to lean on financially if I quit.&quot;</p><p>In retrospect, Svensson compares herself to a closely watched &quot;luxury product&quot; which Al-Fayed wanted to possess -- &quot;a doll on a shelf&quot;.</p><p>Al-Fayed was born Mohamed Fayed in Alexandria, but later changed his surname to the grander Al-Fayed, while his brother kept the original family name.</p><p>-&nbsp;London investigation &#39;continues&#39; -</p><p>At the Ritz, she recalls that staff warned her that there were &quot;microphones and cameras in every corner&quot;. And at a villa in Saint Tropez, she said a housekeeper suggested that she block her bedroom door at night.</p><p>The Ritz Paris told AFP in a statement that it was &quot;deeply saddened by the testimonies and the allegations of abuse&quot; and that it is &quot;ready to fully cooperate with the judicial authorities. Our teams do not tolerate any form of inappropriate behaviour, which would be a serious breach of our code of conduct.</p><p>&quot;We want to express our deepest respect to the women who spoke out,&quot; it added.</p><p>Harrods said it &quot;continues to support the bravery of all women in coming forward. Their claims point to the breadth of abuse by Mohamed Fayed and again raise serious allegations against his brother, Salah Fayed. The picture that has emerged suggests that this pattern of abusive behaviour took place wherever they operated.&quot;</p><p>They said more than 180 survivors had already received counselling support through its independent advocate. The store also urged survivors to claim compensation through the Harrods Redress Scheme.</p><p>London&#39;s Metropolitan police said its &quot;investigation into those who could have facilitated or enabled Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s offending continues&quot; and urged victims to come forward.</p><p>&quot;The way the Met works has moved on immeasurably, and our teams have transformed the way we investigate rape and sexual offences.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for the two women say their testimony helps sketch the outlines of a &quot;powerful system&quot; of trafficking which resembles the one established during the same period by Epstein.</p><p>&quot;As with Epstein, with the Al-Fayeds there is a frenzied consumption of young women and an organised system to procure them,&quot; said lawyer Eva Joly, a former judge and European parliament member.</p><p>&quot;The pattern is the same: selecting vulnerable young women, transport, accommodation, isolation and money, which is used to intimidate or corrupt,&quot; she said.</p><p>And as with the Epstein case, while the statute of limitations may have expired, an investigation into the Al-Fayeds can still establish the facts and identify any victims whose cases could be still prosecuted.</p><p>&quot;We are only at the beginning of piecing the puzzle together in France,&quot; Joly insisted.</p><p>clw-fbe/giv/fg/jj</p></div></article></div>",
