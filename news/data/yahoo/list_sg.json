Foreign Affairs.</figcaption></div></figure><p>SINGAPORE – Singapore cannot let foreign actors impose their narratives or exploit differences, and decisions about its future must be made solely by Singaporeans, said political office-holders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Feb 27.</p><p>Speaking partly in Mandarin during the debate on her ministry’s budget, Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sim Ann told the House that the first line of defence against foreign influence campaigns is a vigilant and discerning public.</p><p>“Decisions about Singapore’s future must be made by Singaporeans and Singaporeans only, free from external manipulation,” she said.</p><p>At a time of fragmentation when trust and consistency are in deficit, Singapore must continue to be clear-eyed about its national interests, said Ms Sim. It has to assess its options dispassionately and make hard-nosed decisions that are only in Singapore’s interest.</p><p>“Most importantly, we must stand on our own two feet. We cannot rely on others to secure our interests and our destiny,” she said.</p><p>There are situations where Singapore sometimes has to say no, after careful consideration, to partners and friends. Doing so is not easy, and is made more challenging with foreign infiltration in Singapore’s information space, she added.</p><p>She said Singaporeans should be particularly careful when they come across content that highlights or appeals to one particular ethnicity over another.</p><p>“On the whole, we should be vigilant towards online commentaries targeted at Singapore. Some of these could be attempts to undermine our confidence, or exploit our fault lines,” she said in Mandarin.</p><p>With a diverse, digitally connected population, Singapore is an attractive and vulnerable target, she noted.</p><p>Ms Sim added that the development of advanced digital tools has supercharged the ability of foreign actors to seed narratives and even mount hostile information campaigns to advance their interests, and such activities have clearly increased.</p><p>Speaking on the same issue but in Malay, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim said foreign actors may impose their narratives, exploit Singaporeans’ differences and pressure them to see and accept their views.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“But we must remain calm in judgment, clear in principle and direction, and confident in our values. We must stay united and strengthen our social compact.”</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain said Singapore’s national interest is its guiding compass in foreign policy.</p><p>“We must continue to clearly identify and assert our national interests - be it safeguarding our sovereignty or protecting our social cohesion - and use our capabilities to chart the right path,” he said.</p><p>To deal with these external pressures, Singapore must continue to build domestic support for foreign policy, suggested MPs such as Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs.</p><p>MFA has stepped up engagement efforts with Singaporeans, said Ms Sim.</p><p>These include students, youths, businesses, and grassroot leaders, through closed-door dialogue sessions and workshops to help Singaporeans better understand Singapore’s operating context and foreign policy considerations.</p><p>“Foreign policy begins at home,” said Ms Sim.</p><p>“Our ability to stand firm on the world stage depends on having our people’s trust and support, and our ability to remain calm and collected in the face of challenging external circumstances. We can only act with confidence if Singaporeans are united behind us.”</p><h2>Advancing global partnerships</h2><p>Mr Yip and Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) asked how Singapore is advancing partnerships with middle powers in the aspects of geopolitics, trade and technology.</p><p>Ms Sim said that one key strategy is to strengthen and expand Singapore’s partnerships with like-minded countries, including major and middle powers.</p><p>“With this circle of trusted friends, we will forge ahead in both critical sectors like defence cooperation, but also in new and exciting domains such as energy, technology and sustainability,” she said.</p><p>Singapore upgraded its relationships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand, and Vietnam to the level of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2025.

It has supported over 163,000 foreign officials through training and capacity-building programmes, with 60 per cent of SCP’s participants coming from Southeast Asia.</p><p>Even as Singapore is expanding external partnerships, MFA is strengthening consular support for Singaporeans overseas, she said.</p><p>Besides enhancing its eRegister system for Singaporeans travelling overseas, its 24/7 Consular Response Centre provides effective and timely support for Singaporean travellers.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-cannot-let-foreign-actors-exploit-differences-public-must-be-vigilant-and-discerning-mfa?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Singapore has to retain its ability to say “no” to others even if it has to pay a price for staking out its position on issues, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.</p><p>Speaking in Parliament on Feb 27, he noted that the Republic will face more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices in a tumultuous world. On some issues, Singapore’s interests will not always be aligned with the great or middle powers, or its immediate neighbours.</p><p>But as pressure to take sides mounts externally and domestically, the country has to stand firm and say no, Dr Balakrishnan said in a speech that laid out Singapore’s foreign policy stance during the debate on his ministry’s budget.</p><p>“Sometimes we will pay a price for staking out our position,” he said. “But...if we ever lose that ability to say no, then that is the day that Singapore loses its relevance, indeed our independence.”</p><p>It is not about choosing sides, but upholding principles and Singapore’s long term national interests, he added.</p><p>He told the House that a new stable equilibrium will not emerge in 2026, with the world now more dangerous for small countries.</p><p>While the global order that used to underpin Singapore’s success has ended, the country has the agency, resilience and resources to chart its own course, he said, describing the current situation as “not just a small tremor, (but a) geostrategic tectonic plate rupture”.</p><p>Singapore will exercise its agency to articulate its positions – which have not been universally welcomed in the past – that align with its national interests, he said.</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan acknowledged that Singaporeans will have different views on foreign policy issues, though they do not necessarily have to agree on their stances.</p><p>“But we must agree that these are matters to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone,” he said.</p><p>“With increased global contestation, foreign actors will want us to see and accept their views. They will try to seed their narratives. There may be attempts to create fake news or deepen internal division.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Singapore must be aware that geopolitical contestation has become a tussle for hearts and minds, and exercise caution as the diverse population here is vulnerable to becoming polarised and fractured, he added.</p><p>In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan cited past examples where Singapore had consistently called out violations of international law – when <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russias-putin-announces-a-military-operation-in-ukraine\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Russia invaded Ukraine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Russia invaded Ukraine</a> and in relation to the United States’ actions in Venezuela.</p><p>“We took these stands because a world based on ‘might is right’ is more dangerous for Singapore,” he said.</p><p>Singapore has also expressed disappointment with <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/singapore-tariffs-to-stay-unchanged-as-trump-imposes-new-10-global-levies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the US tariffs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the US tariffs</a> that contravened the principles of a rules-based trading system and mechanisms like the most favoured nation principle.</p><p>“Trade is our lifeblood,” said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that the Republic’s total trade is more than three times its gross domestic product.</p><p>“Jobs, investments, and living standards depend on our predictable access to external markets.”</p><p>Singapore also took clear positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-strongly-condemns-terror-attacks-on-israel-calls-for-end-to-violence\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:condemning the Oct 7, 2023 attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">condemning the Oct 7, 2023 attack</a> and stating that Israel’s military response has breached international humanitarian law, he added.</p><p>He reiterated Singapore’s national interests: to safeguard sovereignty, independence and national unity; to secure access to essential supplies and freedom of navigation; to strengthen its role as a global hub for trade and other areas; and to support a rules-based multilateral order wherever possible.</p><p>Going forward, as a small state, Singapore must try to shape its environment and carve out conditions most conducive for its survival and success.</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan said his ministry will do this by engaging all great powers constructively and giving them a stake in the stability and prosperity of the region, as this provides small states like Singapore with room to manoeuvre.</p><p>Several MPs like Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) and Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC) raised concerns about US-China tensions and Singapore’s ability to navigate this, to which Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore wants to work with both countries “where our interests coincide”.</p><p>“And where our interests diverge, we will have to courteously stand up and say no,” he said, adding that there must be an understanding that it is not personal decision, or done as a proxy for either side, but based on a principal assessment of Singapore’s national interests.</p><p>“The reality is that all countries, including Singapore, will have to find creative ways to work with both the US and China,” he said.</p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also work to strengthen a wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability – such as by upgrading partnerships and opening more diplomatic missions – and deepening regional integration for Asean to remain relevant.</p><p>The regional grouping remains a cornerstone of the Republic’s foreign policy, said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that Singapore will assume the Asean chairmanship in 2027.</p><p>“This is a heavy responsibility, but also an opportunity. We will use our chairmanship to pursue deeper integration and promote external partnerships,” he said.</p><p>“We will work to keep the Asean region open for business, open to the world, and committed to peace, stability and cooperation.”</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan said his ministry will also build greater synergy between Singapore and its immediate neighbours.</p><p>Responding to Mr Patrick Tay (Pioneer) on stepping up engagement with Malaysia and Indonesia, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore has resolved longstanding issues with Indonesia and is exploring mutually beneficial projects in energy, food security, education and healthcare.</p><p>With Malaysia, the leaders meet regularly for candid discussions which have led to beneficial regional partnerships.</p><p>“At the same time, we must manage outstanding bilateral issues that are complex and will take time to resolve. We will always be close neighbours so we cannot afford to allow spiky issues to undermine our overall positive cooperation.”</p><p>The minister also agreed with MPs Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) and Lee Hong Chuang (Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC) on the need to continue support for the multilateral system.</p><p>Singapore remains committed to the World Trade Organisation but achieving consensus among 166 members is difficult, he noted.</p><p>Instead, Singapore will aim for high-ambition agreements with like-minded partners that are inclusive so others can join when ready.</p><p>Concluding his speech, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that Singapore is in a far better position today to deal with the various challenges, with the prerequisites for success in place: domestic unity, economic relevance and defence capabilities.</p><p>He noted that domestic unity is a work constantly in progress, especially in the face of forces that seek to divide its people.</p><p>“As long as we can inoculate ourselves from foreign influence, as long as we can disagree maturely and ultimately, still forge a domestic consensus, we will continue to thrive,” he said.</p><p>“We cannot be bought or bullied by anyone.”</p><p>Singapore’s economic vitality and relevance to the world as a “trusted, stable hub” also cannot be taken for granted, and must be preserved, said Dr Balakrishnan.</p><p>“There is a premium in such a world for stability, consistency and respect for the rule of law.”</p><p>Additionally, Singapore’s steady spending on defence - ranging between three to six per cent of GDP for almost six decades - has also allowed the Republic to defend itself.</p><p>“We must preserve this capability, because it keeps us safe - and we are a country that can hope for the best, but also prepare for the worst,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-must-retain-ability-to-say-no-even-if-it-has-to-pay-a-price-for-position-on-issues-vivian?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

a crunch local poll result Friday that heaps pressure on&nbsp;unpopular Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Labour&nbsp;also&nbsp;finished behind the hard-right, anti-immigrant&nbsp;Reform UK party in the by-election for the parliamentary seat of Gorton and Denton in Manchester, as the country&#39;s traditional two-party system fractures.</p><p>The&nbsp;result&nbsp;in a seat that Labour has dominated for decades&nbsp;shows how the party is being squeezed by both ends of the political spectrum and&nbsp;is likely to increase chatter about how much longer the 63-year-old Starmer can stay in office.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons appear more willing to look towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>Labour won the constituency with almost 51 percent of the vote at the July 2024 general election that swept Starmer to power and ousted the Conservatives from 14 consecutive years in office.</p><p>But&nbsp;his&nbsp;government has since been beset by numerous policy reversals and several rows, including over the appointment of Peter Mandelson, an associate of&nbsp;late&nbsp;sex

on lawmakers to address the issue of the monarchy&#39;s survival.</p><p>Only the male offspring of the male side of the family can currently ascend the ancient Chrysanthemum Throne.</p><p>Since Emperor Naruhito, 66, only has one daughter, hopes for continuing the imperial family lie with Prince Hisahito, the teenage son of Crown Prince Akishino.</p><p>Prime Minister Takaichi told parliament on Friday that a panel of experts in 2021 found it&nbsp;&quot;appropriate to limit eligibility to those who are male-line male descendants belonging to the imperial lineage&quot; and she respected their conclusion.</p><p>&quot;The government, and I, myself as well, respect this report,&quot; said Takaichi, the country&#39;s first woman prime minister.</p><p>She previously warned that revising the imperial family&#39;s succession rules was &quot;an urgent matter&quot;, although this would likely involve &quot;adopting&quot; new members.</p><p>Even though tradition dictates only a man can carry on the imperial line -- which goes back 2,600 years according to legend -- opinion polls have shown high public support for a woman taking the throne.</p><p>- &#39;Unbroken imperial line&#39; -</p><p>Japan has debated the royal succession rules for decades, with a key government panel in 2005 recommending that it pass to the oldest child regardless of sex.</p><p>That appeared to pave the way for the emperor&#39;s daughter, Princess Aiko, to rise to&nbsp;the throne. But the birth of Prince Hisahito the following year silenced the debate.</p><p>In 2021, a government-appointed expert panel advised the government to consider allowing the imperial family to &quot;adopt&quot; new male members -- distant relatives who could be brought back into the fold.</p><p>But it is unclear if those men would be willing to give up their careers and freedom to continue the royal lineage.</p><p>The panel also said royal daughters -- currently forced to leave the family after marriage -- could potentially continue their public duties after their nuptials.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Traditionalists have asserted that the &quot;unbroken imperial line&quot; of male succession is the foundation of Japan, and major changes would divide the nation.</p><p>Under the post-war constitution, the royal family holds no political power.</p><p>Historically, women who wed royals have faced intense pressure to produce sons and some family members are regular subjects of online and media gossip.</p><p>Empress Masako, a former high-flying diplomat, struggled for years with a stress-related illness after joining the household, which some have put down to the pressure to have a boy.</p><p>Empress Emerita Michiko, Naruhito&#39;s mother, also suffered stress-induced illnesses.</p><p>Hisahito&#39;s sister, Mako, married her university boyfriend, Kei Komuro.</p><p>She faced intense tabloid reporting over claims that Kei&#39;s family had run into financial difficulties, leading the former princess to develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

traded on the glamour of owning Harrods, the Paris Ritz and luxury yachts, but Mohamed Al-Fayed was at the centre of a dark web of alleged abuse, say French lawyers for women who liken him to US sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>French authorities began investigating the late Egyptian businessman and his brother Salah last year amid allegations of a vast system of sex trafficking and abuse on French soil.</p><p>&quot;Every time I met Mohamed Al-Fayed, he tried to assault me,&quot; his former personal assistant Kristina Svensson told French police of her two years working at the Ritz.</p><p>Her testimony is all too familiar.</p><p>The alleged crimes of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who died in 2023 aged 94, first came to light in a BBC investigation in September 2024. In it, several young women who worked at his upmarket London department store Harrods accused him of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>British police told AFP that 154 victims have so far come forward to say the former owner of Premier League club Fulham abused them.</p><p>His brother Salah, who died in 2010, is also accused.</p><p>But frustrated by London Metropolitan Police&#39;s investigation of the alleged crimes, which span more than 35 years, some victims have turned to France in the hope of finding justice.</p><p>&quot;In England they&#39;re ignoring the trafficking... They just want to make it about Al-Fayed and Harrods,&quot; said Rachael Louw, a former Al-Fayed employee, speaking for the first time about her ordeal.</p><p>The French investigation, however, is handled by &quot;a unit specialised in human trafficking,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>It is &quot;a relief that our cases are actually being recognised as trafficking&quot;.</p><p>- Consumed &#39;like meat&#39; -</p><p>Louw was 23 when her bosses sent her to Salah Fayed&#39;s yacht on the French Riviera. Now after 31 years she was able to testify about what happened there to French investigators on February 10.</p><p>Louw told AFP she was first &quot;spotted&quot; by Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1993 while working as a sales assistant at Harrods. Shortly after, she was placed on a management training scheme, which required her to submit to a medical exam by a Harley Street doctor before being employed by the chairman&#39;s office in the summer of 1994.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The medical appointment went far beyond a standard checkup, with a pelvic exam and &quot;thorough breast exam&quot;, smear and HIV tests.</p><p>And the results were not kept confidential.</p><p>The report, seen by AFP, was handed over to Harrods, and described Louw&#39;s personal life: her parents&#39; separation when she was young, her father living in the United States and the death of her mother and grandmother.</p><p>The doctor also noted that she took a birth control pill, had a boyfriend and was in &quot;excellent&quot; health.</p><p>The doctor &quot;sent confidential information to arm the rapist&quot;, said French lawyer Eva Joly, who is representing Louw and another former Al-Fayed assistant.</p><p>&quot;These young women were like meat, and they wanted to know if they were fit to consume,&quot; said Caroline Joly, another member of the legal team.</p><p>Several encounters were arranged between Louw and Salah Fayed at his home in London&#39;s glitzy Park Lane, where Louw said she was drugged with &quot;a crack cocaine mix&quot;.</p><p>Louw was then offered a job as an assistant to Salah in France and she was sent there by private jet.</p><p>She said she refused further drugs, &quot;and because he didn&#39;t push anymore, I thought it was okay&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;no&nbsp;reason&nbsp;not to trust&nbsp;this&nbsp;man... this&nbsp;was&nbsp;my&nbsp;first job&nbsp;from&nbsp;university.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;I didn&#39;t feel safe&#39; -</p><p>Staff confiscated her passport as she flew from London&#39;s Luton airport to his yacht. And once she arrived, &quot;nothing&quot; resembled the job she signed up for.</p><p>&quot;I thought I was supposed to be filing paperwork, making arrangements, organising office work,&quot; she said.</p><p>Instead &quot;there was no office, no normal working hours, no time off. I was expected to just be with him&quot;, she said.</p><p>Louw recalled appearing alongside Salah Fayed at dinners attended by elderly, wealthy men with &quot;young girls and lots of touching&quot;.</p><p>When she managed to call her boyfriend, who worked at Harrods, he was fired.</p><p>One night, Louw woke up to find Salah in her bed, claiming he was lonely, she said.</p><p>&quot;I went ramrod straight and the rest of the night I was awake just lying there petrified,&quot; she said, fearing any movement would be an invitation for him to touch her.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know what he would do to me... I didn&#39;t feel safe.&quot;</p><p>She saw other young women in the Fayeds&#39; orbit.</p><p>On a trip to Saint Tropez she encountered a red-headed &quot;young girl&quot;, possibly younger than herself, sunbathing on Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s yacht that was moored just off his villa. </p><p>&quot;Mohamed starts rubbing lotion all over this girl, she&#39;s wearing a bathing suit and then he started to kiss her,&quot; Louw told AFP.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything else&quot; of that day, she said, &quot;so I don&#39;t know if there were drugs, I can&#39;t say for sure whether I was drugged that afternoon,&quot; she added.</p><p>What jolted her to escape was the prospect of being trapped alone with Salah after he bought a speedboat with only one bedroom, telling her &quot;that he would take me to sail around the Italian coast&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I knew that if I went on that boat nothing good would happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Panicked, she booked the first Air France flight out and worked up the courage to ask for her passport back, which she received although it was clear Salah &quot;was very angry&quot;.</p><p>Home again, &quot;I had&nbsp;blocked out&quot; the details of what happened, she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to&nbsp;remember.&quot;</p><p>For decades she feared she was bound by a confidentiality agreement she had signed at her interview, but seeing other victims speak out against Al-Fayed in 2024, she reconsidered.</p><p>&quot;How can I be silent?&nbsp;There has to be a cost to what the perpetrators did. Because if they go unpunished, it emboldens the next man.</p><p>&quot;If we women do not speak up we become complicit in our own oppression... powerful men will never change a system that benefits them.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Organised system&#39; -</p><p>Despite the deaths of the brothers, the women hope investigators can still track down who enabled the trafficking network.</p><p>&quot;There is no such thing as a small piece of information. Every element is useful for the investigation,&quot; for Al-Fayed assistant Svensson said, calling on victims and witnesses to speak to police.</p><p>The Swedish woman arrived in France in 1993 and was placed by a temp agency at the Ritz in 1998, then owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed, as his assistant.</p><p>Svensson, aged 30 at the time, was to help him manage his affairs after the death of his son Dodi with Princess Diana in a Paris car crash, perceived as a prestigious assignment.</p><p>During her interview with the Ritz management, the questions posed were &quot;focused&quot; on her appearance and her personal background, she said, even pointing out that she was the &quot;spitting image&quot; of Al-Fayed&#39;s wife.</p><p>The Ritz then sent her to Harrods in London for an interview with Al-Fayed himself, and organised&nbsp;accommodation for her at a luxury residence he owned.</p><p>&quot;I had brought my CV. He wasn&#39;t interested in that. He only asked me personal questions.&quot;</p><p>What followed was a regular pattern of meetings with Al-Fayed. Svensson said she was left in a room alone for hours with no instruction, until he eventually arrived and she would endure sexual assault and attempted rape during which &quot;he&#39;d laugh&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hoped that in time he would see that I wasn&#39;t interested in him and that he would take me seriously,&quot; Svensson told police.</p><p>&quot;I was a foreigner, with no family or network in the country, no knowledge of French labour law, and no one to lean on financially if I quit.&quot;</p><p>In retrospect, Svensson compares herself to a closely watched &quot;luxury product&quot; which Al-Fayed wanted to possess -- &quot;a doll on a shelf&quot;.</p><p>Al-Fayed was born Mohamed Fayed in Alexandria, but later changed his surname to the grander Al-Fayed, while his brother kept the original family name.</p><p>-&nbsp;London investigation &#39;continues&#39; -</p><p>At the Ritz, she recalls that staff warned her that there were &quot;microphones and cameras in every corner&quot;. And at a villa in Saint Tropez, she said a housekeeper suggested that she block her bedroom door at night.</p><p>The Ritz Paris told AFP in a statement that it was &quot;deeply saddened by the testimonies and the allegations of abuse&quot; and that it is &quot;ready to fully cooperate with the judicial authorities. Our teams do not tolerate any form of inappropriate behaviour, which would be a serious breach of our code of conduct.</p><p>&quot;We want to express our deepest respect to the women who spoke out,&quot; it added.</p><p>Harrods said it &quot;continues to support the bravery of all women in coming forward. Their claims point to the breadth of abuse by Mohamed Fayed and again raise serious allegations against his brother, Salah Fayed. The picture that has emerged suggests that this pattern of abusive behaviour took place wherever they operated.&quot;</p><p>They said more than 180 survivors had already received counselling support through its independent advocate. The store also urged survivors to claim compensation through the Harrods Redress Scheme.</p><p>London&#39;s Metropolitan police said its &quot;investigation into those who could have facilitated or enabled Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s offending continues&quot; and urged victims to come forward.</p><p>&quot;The way the Met works has moved on immeasurably, and our teams have transformed the way we investigate rape and sexual offences.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for the two women say their testimony helps sketch the outlines of a &quot;powerful system&quot; of trafficking which resembles the one established during the same period by Epstein.</p><p>&quot;As with Epstein, with the Al-Fayeds there is a frenzied consumption of young women and an organised system to procure them,&quot; said lawyer Eva Joly, a former judge and European parliament member.</p><p>&quot;The pattern is the same: selecting vulnerable young women, transport, accommodation, isolation and money, which is used to intimidate or corrupt,&quot; she said.</p><p>And as with the Epstein case, while the statute of limitations may have expired, an investigation into the Al-Fayeds can still establish the facts and identify any victims whose cases could be still prosecuted.</p><p>&quot;We are only at the beginning of piecing the puzzle together in France,&quot; Joly insisted.</p><p>clw-fbe/giv/fg/jj</p></div></article></div>",
