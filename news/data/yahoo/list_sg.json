Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that there were &quot;many signs&quot; Iran&#39;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was dead, after Israel and the United States launched an attack of unprecedented scale against the Islamic republic.</p><p>The strikes prompted Tehran to fire off a missile barrage that sent people running for cover in cities across the Middle East.</p><p>Iranian authorities urged residents to evacuate the capital, a city of 10 million, while the country&#39;s Red Crescent society said that at least 201 people had been killed in the strikes and more than 700 wounded.</p><p>The Iranian judiciary said one strike that hit a school in the south killed 108 people, although AFP was unable to access the site to verify the toll or the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UAE reported one civilian dead and damage from missiles in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, as blasts from Tehran&#39;s retaliatory salvo and air defences intercepting it also echoed over Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and Kuwait.</p><p>&quot;This morning, in a powerful surprise strike, the compound of the tyrant Ali Khamenei was destroyed in the heart of Tehran... and there are many signs that this tyrant is no longer alive,&quot; Netanyahu said in a televised statement.</p><p>Cheers could be heard on Tehran&#39;s streets after reports of the death, according to witnesses.</p><p>Plumes of black smoke had been seen over Tehran&#39;s Pasteur district, where Khamenei usually resides, with Israel&#39;s Channel 12 network reporting 30 bombs were dropped on the compound.</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had earlier told NBC News that Khamenei was alive &quot;as far as I know&quot;, adding that &quot;all high-ranking officials are alive&quot;.</p><p>Also asked about Khamenei&#39;s health, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told the BBC he was &quot;not in a situation to confirm anything&quot;, but &quot;the whole system, the whole nation is focused on defending (our) national integrity&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

coming days, while Iran&#39;s top security official vowed a fierce reprisal.</p><p>&quot;This morning we eliminated senior figures in the ayatollahs&#39; regime -- commanders in the Revolutionary Guards and senior officials in the nuclear programme -- and we will continue,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p><p>Ali Larijani, head of Iran&#39;s Supreme National Security Council, said: &quot;The brave soldiers and the great nation of Iran will teach an unforgettable lesson to the international oppressors.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Barbaric&#39; -</p><p>Tehran residents had been going about their usual

United States and Israel launched a major joint assault on Iran on Saturday that US President Donald Trump said would devastate the country’s military, dismantle its missile program and ultimately pave the way for regime change, prompting an unprecedented wave of retaliatory strikes from Tehran.</p><p>In a video on Truth Social, Trump accused Iran of rejecting “every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions,” and said the US “can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>Unlike the last time the US and Israel struck Iran, in June, these strikes began in daylight on Saturday morning – the first day of the week in Iran – as millions went to work or school. And whereas the US strikes in June were over within a few hours, sources have told CNN that the US military is this time planning for several days of attacks, suggesting broader objectives.</p><p>In response, the Iranian regime has launched an unprecedented wave of strikes across the Middle East, targeting several countries that host US military bases. Blasts have been heard from the beaches of Dubai to the streets of Doha, in what could be the opening salvos of a war that threatens to engulf the region.</p><p>The extent of the damage in Iran and across the region is still emerging. Here’s what we know so far.</p><h3>How did we get here?</h3><p>The Iranian government has been under severe pressure since the turn of the year. Already weakened by last summer’s war with Israel, which the US briefly joined, the regime has been battling a severe economic crisis which sparked nationwide protests in January.</p><p>After a crackdown left thousands of protesters dead, Trump promised to come to their aid. He warned the US was “locked and loaded” to attack and began moving huge amounts of materiel to the region.</p><p>Despite the military buildup, the US also resumed efforts to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran. The last round of talks ended in Switzerland on Thursday, with Iran agreeing “never” to stockpile enriched uranium. The Omani foreign minister, who has acted as a mediator in the talks, said there had been “significant” progress.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QNnuLQqf1R7KcORqogt6lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3167b742d67966a4e873cbef04243b16><noscript><img alt=\"People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QNnuLQqf1R7KcORqogt6lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3167b742d67966a4e873cbef04243b16 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>People run for cover following an explosion in Tehran, on Saturday, February 28. - Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Why did the US strike Iran?</h3><p>That progress, however, was not enough to prevent the US from taking military action. In his 2.30 a.m. address, Trump said the main objective of the strikes – which the Department of Defense is calling “Operation Epic Fury” – is “to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.”</p><p>Those threats, he said, included Iran’s nuclear program – which the White House claimed to have “totally” obliterated with its strikes in June.</p><p>“It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said, without providing evidence that Iran was any closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon. “They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>The president also repeated his recent claims that Iran is building ballistic missiles which could reach the US mainland. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Trump said Iran has “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America.”</p><p>But these claims are not backed up by US intelligence, CNN has previously reported. An <a href=\"https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Documents/News/golden_dome.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unclassified assessment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unclassified assessment</a> from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) from 2025 said that Iran could develop a “militarily-viable” intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by 2035 “should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.”</p><p>According to two sources, the claim that Iran will soon have a missile capable of hitting the US is not backed up by intelligence. There is no intelligence to suggest that Iran is pursuing an ICBM program to hit the US at this time, the sources said.</p><h3>Why is Israel striking Iran?</h3><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long viewed Iran as Israel’s most dangerous adversary. After crippling Iran’s proxies – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Israel last summer launched a war against Iran itself.</p><p>Although Israel halted the conflict after the US struck Iran’s nuclear sites, analysts had long suspected that Netanyahu would take an opportunity to resume attacks on Iran. With elections due in October, Netanyahu may also see the return to war as a chance to shore up his standing domestically.</p><p>In a video statement Saturday, explaining why Israel was resuming its strikes on Iran, Netanyahu also repeated his claim that the Islamic regime must not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.</p><h3>Are the US and Israel seeking regime change?</h3><p>In their statements, both Trump and Netanyahu were clear about their hopes for regime change in Iran.</p><p>Trump addressed the Iranian people directly, telling them that “the hour of your freedom is at hand.”</p><p>“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be, probably, your only chance for generations,” he said.</p><p>Netanyahu also called on “all parts of the Iranian people” to “cast off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peaceful Iran.” He said the US and Israeli actions “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands.”</p><p>An Israeli military official has, however, emphasized that the main focus of the operation remains on military targets.</p><h3>What has been hit?</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm5z7xcn0000356rmo74ffpk&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Explosions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Explosions</a> were heard in<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm6071dj00003b6sir79z60w&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Tehran’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> Tehran’s</a> Pasteur district, where the highly secure compound housing the residence and office of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is located, Iranian state-affiliated news outlets said.

The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties. That often happens in war, but we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission.”</p><p>CNN has reached out to the Justice Department and White House counsel’s office for comment.</p><p>While only Congress can declare or authorize war, Trump and other presidents have continuously cited the Constitution’s Article II, which says the commander in chief has the power to direct US military forces in engagements necessary to advance American national interests abroad.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In addition, the Supreme Court has been generous in approving Trump’s expansive use of power, most notably in its 2024 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:immunity ruling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">immunity ruling</a>.

Trump, in his video announcing the strikes, described the military campaign as “massive and ongoing.” The US military is planning for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?post-id=cmm611ktx0000356sxgl3ufg4&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:several days of attacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">several days of attacks</a>, according to two sources.</p><p>“The Justice Department has come up with an increasingly dubious series of arguments in attempts to defend such strikes, but virtually all of those arguments have depended on assertions that the strikes were limited and unlikely to lead to a broader conflict,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.</p><p>“Even if that were a legal argument, rather than a policy one, it’s hard to take that remotely seriously here,” Vladeck said.</p><p>Article II powers were cited for President George H.W.

It’s an awful regime.

But please don’t worry,” she wrote.</p><p>A friend of Aghayeva, Sabah Bari, described her as a “highly motivated” and “extremely intelligent” person who is involved in student organizations, academically accomplished and “very funny.”</p><p>Aghayeva is on track to graduate in May, said Bari, a student at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health.</p><p>On social media, Aghayeva offers a glimpse into her world, blending library study sessions with motivational messages and hints of her immigrant journey. “As long as I am alive, I can begin again … There is no end.

The officer “asked multiple times for a warrant, which was not produced, and asked for time to call his boss, which was not given,” she said.</p><p>Shipman emphasized law enforcement officers must present a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the university, including residence halls, classrooms and buildings requiring Columbia University ID card access. An administrative warrant, she wrote, is not sufficient.</p><p>“All law enforcement agencies – including DHS and ICE – are obligated to follow established legal and ethical standards. And we expect those standards to be respected,” she said in a statement following Aghayeva’s release.</p><p>“This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,” she said.</p><h3>DHS claims her student visa was terminated</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7><noscript><img alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>DHS confirmed to CNN that ICE arrested Aghayeva, “whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes.”</p><p>“The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.

identified her as one of several Columbia students targeted for immigration action under the Trump administration’s crackdown on international students involved in protests related to the Israel-Hamas

administration’s continued attack on universities and immigrants,” the American Civil Liberties Union in New York said in a statement to CNN.</p><h3>What can agents legally do?</h3><p>Without a warrant, federal agents can only enter campus areas of Columbia University that are open to the public such as outdoor walkways, according to CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson.</p><p>They have no legal right to enter residences or restricted university buildings without “specific legal authorization,” which would be a judicial warrant signed by an independent judge or magistrate but not an immigration official, Jackson said.</p><p>Immigration officials, he added, typically sign administrative warrants that may note immigration violations and authorize detention but “do not allow searches and seizures on private property.”</p><p>Columbia’s president has specified that an administrative warrant is “not sufficient” to access the university’s non-public areas, and that federal agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena.</p><p>Furthermore, tactics that include misrepresentation to gain access would be illegal and against the Constitution, said Jackson.</p><p>In the case of Aghayeva, it appears the law was “flagrantly violated,” which he says has parallels to the cases of 5-year-old <a

oil-rich region&#39;s wealthy rulers.</p><p>Missiles streaked across clear desert skies as smoke plumed from US bases in Manama and Abu Dhabi and loud thuds shook high-rise windows in Dubai.</p><p>In Qatar, dozens of people fled in panic as a falling missile plunged into a residential neighbourhood, erupting in a fireball as it hit the street.</p><p>Flames and smoke erupted from a luxury hotel on Dubai&#39;s Palm, the landmark, palm tree-shaped development of land reclaimed from the sea, after a loud bang sent passers-by scurrying for cover.</p><p>And in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates&#39; capital, golfers enjoying a quiet round were stunned to see dozens of projectiles flying overhead.</p><p>The Gulf monarchies have worked hard to stay on the periphery of Middle East conflict, relying on their stability to attract business, trade and tourism.</p><p>The staunch US allies have carefully courted Iran, their powerful Shia neighbour. Saudi Arabia, a rival heavyweight, mended ties with Tehran after a seven-year rupture in 2023.</p><p>Given their reputation for calm, Saturday&#39;s sudden attacks on US military bases caused widespread shock among the Gulf&#39;s diverse, expat-heavy populations.</p><p>In Bahrain&#39;s capital Manama, residents were hurriedly evacuated from the Juffair district housing the US navy&#39;s Fifth Fleet, whose base was hit in the attack.</p><p>&quot;When we heard the sounds, we cried out of fear,&quot; said Jana Hassan, a 15-year-old school student, who was visiting a friend in the area.</p><p>&quot;We didn&#39;t know what to do... I will never forget the sound of those loud blasts.&quot;</p><p>In Dubai, the Middle East&#39;s commercial hub with the world&#39;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, residents looked up to see missiles surge through the sky.</p><p>&quot;It was a rumble and then a bang,&quot; one resident told AFP, asking not to be named.</p><p>- &#39;Very scary and very loud&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>An American resident of Qatar&#39;s capital Doha, who also asked not to be identified, heard two blasts as she was driving home, where she &quot;heard several more and the glass was shaking&quot;.</p><p>She said she was &quot;furious&quot; about the instability, after 20 years of living in Qatar. Her teenage sons, she said, are &quot;asking me if we will have to go back home&quot;.</p><p>Qatar was targeted twice last year, when Iran mounted a telegraphed attack on the Al Udeid US base in June and Israel struck a Hamas meeting in Doha in September.</p><p>Those attacks were a Gulf rarity at the time. The UAE had not been troubled since a deadly assault by Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels in 2022, whose attacks on Saudi Arabia have also stopped in recent years.</p><p>&quot;As a Lebanese, I am traumatised,&quot; a 31-year-old expat and mother of two living in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;We came to the Gulf because it&#39;s known to be safer than Lebanon. Now I don&#39;t know what to do or how to think really,&quot; added the woman, who did not want to be named.</p><p>Another Riyadh resident, from Jordan, said: &quot;It was honestly very scary and very loud.</p><p>&quot;I was just walking out with my little boy when we suddenly heard the blast. People around us were looking up at the sky, trying to understand what was happening.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not something you expect in Riyadh.&quot;</p><p>burs-th/ds/dcp</p></div></article></div>",

KENARE)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The US-Israeli strikes launched on Iran Saturday could become an extended operation, with strategic goals both multiple and complex -- aiming to decapitate the Islamic republic and eviscerate its security capabilities.</p><p>In the 12-day war in June last year, the Israelis, backed by the Americans,&nbsp;carried out targeted strikes aimed at destroying key Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>This time &quot;we are embarking on an operation that is unfolding on a completely different scale, more complex and more complicated&quot; than in June, Israel&#39;s army chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir warned.</p><p>Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said US and Israeli installations involved in the operation were &quot;legitimate targets&quot; -- before Iran&#39;s state televison announced a new wave of missiles had been fired at US bases in the Gulf.</p><p>&quot;We are in a large-scale military campaign that, in my opinion, is going to last several days, or even several weeks,&quot; said David Khalfa, co-founder of the Atlantic Middle East Forum research centre.</p><p>- &#39;Existential&#39; phase -</p><p>He described the attacks as a &quot;multi-domain offensive&quot; aimed &quot;both at disrupting the regime&#39;s chain of command, shaking the repressive apparatus at its foundations, and provoking at the very least an internal transition, if not outright regime change&quot;.</p><p>The joint US-Israeli strikes targeted Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- still alive, according to Tehran -- as well as the chief of staff and head of the Revolutionary Guards, the regime&#39;s ideological army.</p><p>On top of that, there have been strikes on Iran&#39;s ballistic missile programme.</p><p>&quot;This is an all-out decapitation campaign and an effort to wear down Iran&#39;s capabilities,&quot; Khalfa told AFP.</p><p>&quot;It is a direct blow to the state&#39;s security architecture and governing apparatus,&quot; said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at British think tank Chatham House.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;This new stage of conflict is existential and clearly about regime survival. It is also unlikely to end quickly.&quot;</p><p>Araghchi appeared to be dampening down an escalation by announcing on US television that he had explained to Gulf capitals that Tehran had &quot;no intention of attacking them&quot; but was targeting US bases on their soil &quot;as an act of self-defence&quot;.</p><p>Although there is currently no communication with Washington, &quot;if the Americans want to talk to us, they know how they can contact me,&quot; the Iranian minister said, adding he was &quot;clearly interested in de-escalation&quot;.</p><p>- Potential conflagration -</p><p>According to Khalfa however, the Iranians are already &quot;in horizontal escalation&quot;.</p><p>At a moment when the regime&#39;s survival is at stake, &quot;they are prepared to regionalise the conflict by targeting American bases in the Arabian-Persian Gulf and by striking Israel as well&quot;, he argued.</p><p>The danger is that Arab countries &quot;might decide to allow the Americans to launch strikes from their bases, or even join the fray themselves because they consider that the Iranian regime has crossed red lines by attacking them on a massive scale,&quot; said Khalfa.</p><p>At the same time, Iran&#39;s proxies could also push for a regional escalation that would prolong the conflict.</p><p>Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah has already called on Saturday for &quot;the states and peoples of the region&quot; to oppose the &quot;aggression&quot; on Iran.</p><p>Washington itself &quot;risks being drawn into a new conflict in the Middle East with no clear way out&quot;, said Brandan Buck, a researcher at the Washington-based Cato Institute.</p><p>President Donald Trump &quot;is repeating the same pattern of strategic self-delusion that trapped his predecessors, promising limited action while paving the way for a protracted conflict&quot;, he said.</p><p>dt-dab/lpt/db/jj</p></div></article></div>",
