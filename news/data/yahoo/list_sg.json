Singapore’s total social spending has increased in Budget 2026 to provide more help for Singaporeans, said Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Feb 26.</p><p>While some have observed social transfers to be smaller than in Budget 2025, support remains substantial and has been broadened in scope, with more given to those with greater needs, he added.</p><p>Even while it helps cushion the cost pressures for households here, PM Wong said the Government’s approach is for steady and sustainable wage growth, which is a more durable solution in the long-term.</p><p>Addressing <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/tackle-inequality-address-cost-of-living-concerns-mps-at-day-1-of-budget-debate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:cost of living concerns that MPs had raised;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">cost of living concerns that MPs had raised</a> across the three days of the Budget debate, PM Wong said data at both the household and individual levels showed that incomes had risen faster than inflation over the past decade across the entire income distribution.</p><p>While spending has risen in dollar terms, Singaporeans are also spending less on essentials such as food, public transport and education across all income quintiles, he added.</p><p>But the lived experience of higher costs does matter, said PM Wong, who noted that while inflation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine has moderated, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-core-inflation-sees-surprise-drop-to-1-in-january\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:price levels remain high;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">price levels remain high</a>.</p><p>For instance, food consumption forms a smaller share of income, but high prices are experienced each time one dines out. “The psychological impact is immediate and visible,” he acknowledged.</p><p>To cushion the spike in inflation, the Government provided more than $10 billion through the Assurance Package.</p><p>Budget 2026 also saw more help given to seniors, who have to cope with higher prices on fixed incomes, said PM Wong. A retired elderly couple will get about $7,600 in transfers from the Budget, while a lower-income household with young children will get about $5,000.</p><p>This is on top of substantial, broad-based subsidies and targeted support for lower-income families, PM Wong said as he rebutted Mr Louis Chua’s (Sengkang GRC) charge that the Government’s primary response has been to rely on one-off handouts.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“He said that last year, and I had clarified the matter,” said PM Wong. “But regrettably, he has repeated this false claim again.”</p><p>The fact is that only about 5 per cent of the overall budget is for one-off measures, which was also the case in Budget 2025, said the Prime Minister.</p><p>Another driver of costs is manpower, and PM Wong acknowledged that labour costs have indeed risen in recent years.</p><p>This was partly due to structural factors such as an ageing population and tighter labour supply, but also the outcome of policies such as the Progressive Wage Model to raise wages at the bottom.</p><p>PM Wong said that is the right thing to do, as it narrows wage gaps and strengthens dignity in work. But when wages rise, costs also increase, and that is the fundamental tension every economy must manage.</p><p>Some countries suppress service wages to keep prices low, but this traps a segment workers in low-paying jobs, he noted. On the other hand, others such as European countries have high wages, but that leads to higher prices, which in turn has to be supported by a large welfare state.</p><p>Singapore is forging its own path, pursuing broad-based wage growth where wage increases are supported by skills upgrading and productivity improvements.</p><p>At the same time, the Government bears a substantial share of the cost of essential services through subsidies and transfers with more support for lower- and middle-income households, added PM Wong.</p><p>“Overall, this balance has delivered good and affordable services to Singaporeans, at a sustainable cost,” he said.</p><p>PM Wong noted that the one category where household expenditure has gone up as a share of income is healthcare, which reflects Singapore’s ageing population.</p><p>This is why the Government has provided significant and growing subsidies for healthcare services and for national health insurance premiums, while also taking steps to rein in overly generous private riders and other practices that drive up medical inflation, he said.</p><p>“We will continue to ensure that healthcare remains affordable in Singapore,” he said. “No Singaporean will be denied the healthcare they need because of an inability to pay. That is our assurance.”</p><p>Noting that members such as Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) and Nominated MP Terence Ho had suggested additional asset-based transfers, the Prime Minister said this has been the approach the Government has long taken.</p><p>It has done so using mechanisms such as Edusave, CPF and its housing policies to enable Singaporeans to accumulate assets, which gives them a concrete stake in the nation’s success, said PM Wong.</p><p>Singapore also has progressive taxes on wealth, such as on properties and vehicles, and the Government will continue to study ways to moderate excessive wealth concentration.</p><p>But redistribution has its limits, as capital and talent are mobile. Redistribution alone also cannot build a strong and resilient society, said PM Wong.</p><p>“If we rely solely on ever, ever higher taxes, eventually the broad middle will also have to shoulder the burden,” he said.</p><p>Instead, Singapore complements it with heavy investments in human capital: through early childhood education, quality schooling and lifelong learning.</p><p>“Upward mobility remains central to our social compact,” he said. “Because here in Singapore, your starting point should never determine your finishing position.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/wage-growth-not-one-off-handouts-key-to-tackling-cost-pressures-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

a deal.</p><p>The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador&#39;s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.</p><p>Oman&#39;s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides expressed &quot;unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions&quot;. He later said the talks had been paused but would resume later in the day.</p><p>UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP, with an Iranian state TV journalist also reporting he was attending.</p><p>Iran&#39;s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not &quot;at all&quot; seeking a nuclear weapon.</p><p>While Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran&#39;s missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region curtailed.</p><p>As part of the dramatic US build-up, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world&#39;s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete on Thursday, an AFP photographer said.</p><p>Washington has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier -- the USS Abraham Lincoln -- nine destroyers and three other combat ships.</p><p>It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers, which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors, in the region.</p><p>The developments follow massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed.</p><p>- &#39;Sinister nuclear ambitions&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of &quot;pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions&quot;, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump also claimed Tehran had &quot;already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they&#39;re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America&quot;.</p><p>The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims &quot;big lies&quot;.</p><p>The maximum range of Iran&#39;s missiles is 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles), according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.</p><p>However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 kilometres -- less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.</p><p>Trump&#39;s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>Ahead of Thursday&#39;s talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran&#39;s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons &quot;a big, big problem&quot;.</p><p>He followed up by saying &quot;the president wants diplomatic solutions&quot;.</p><p>US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump&#39;s threats &quot;seriously&quot;, saying the US leader had a &quot;right&quot; to use military action.</p><p>&quot;You can&#39;t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,&quot; Vance told &quot;America&#39;s Newsroom&quot; on Fox News.</p><p>- &#39;People would suffer&#39; -</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, has called them &quot;a historic opportunity&quot;, adding that a deal was &quot;within reach&quot;.</p><p>The US was to be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump&#39;s daughter Ivanka.</p><p>The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.</p><p>A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests that posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.</p><p>Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.</p><p>Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided on whether there would be renewed conflict.</p><p>&quot;There would be famine and people would suffer a lot.

They resist stains, oil, grease and water, making them a dream come true for consumers who want to spend less time cleaning or caring for their purchases.</p><p>However, even small amounts of PFAS can be toxic, and larger levels have been linked with an array of negative health effects, including cancer, liver and kidney disease, and birth defects.

Vacuum more.</p><p>“Chemicals in your home products — they don’t stay there. They are shed out.

Your multi-stage carbon filter works pretty well, and reverse-osmosis [filtering] is the most effective.&nbsp;It can be a little bit more expensive compared to the other filter types, but the [reserve-osmosis] filters work really well to reduce PFAS.”</p><p>Of course, the fewer items we own with forever chemicals in them in the first place, the better off we’ll be. So, avoid buying products that claim to be “stain-resistant” or “waterproof,” as these claims are most likely made possible by forever chemicals.</p><p>We also chatted with Stoiber about her take on the risks of using scented candles, the recent controversy over black plastic spatulas in the kitchen, and much more.</p><p><strong>Life: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/funniest-women-social-media-posts-2025-2-14_n_699607dfe4b0f4c9ebbc402d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Feb. 14-20);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Feb. 14-20)</a></strong></p><p><strong>Listen to the full episode above or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/1707391801\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wherever you get your podcasts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wherever you get your podcasts</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Make sure to subscribe to “Am I Doing It Wrong?” on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/1707391801\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:whatever podcast platform you prefer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">whatever podcast platform you prefer</a>&nbsp;so you don’t miss a single episode from our brand-new third season.

Decisions made by Singapore’s ministers are carefully recorded, along with their grounds, said Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing.</p><p>This builds up over time into a corpus of knowledge on ministerial discretion, he added, likening it to building up case law.</p><p>He was responding to Workers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), who had asked about the exercise of executive discretion as Parliament debated the budget of the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Ms He wanted to know how ministerial powers, under laws like the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/five-years-of-pofma-how-has-the-law-been-used-to-combat-fake-news\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act</a> and the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, are monitored to ensure they are exercised judiciously.</p><p>She suggested that public bodies should publish periodic reports detailing how their discretionary powers are used, and asked that the legal principles guiding executive discretion be made publicly known.</p><p>This will provide a clear framework for decision-making and reduce public concern about motives, she added.</p><p>In response, Mr Chan said the law intentionally grants discretion to ministers and other officials so that they can exercise their judgment on how best to handle individual cases based on the specific facts, rather than “mechanically applying a rigid rule”.</p><p>The Prime Minister assigns responsibilities, including statutory functions, to ministers, and all of these functions must be exercised strictly in accordance with the law, he said.</p><p>Such powers are subject to parliamentary oversight and safeguards, he added, noting that the rationale behind granting discretionary functions, as well as their scope, limits, and any necessary safeguards, would have been debated in Parliament when the legislation was passed.</p><p>Mr Chan said while each minister is responsible for exercising his or her assigned statutory functions, the most important issues are brought to the Cabinet for discussion before a final decision is made.</p><p>Ultimately, the Cabinet remains collectively responsible to Parliament, he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In his speech, Mr Chan also covered how the public service is preparing for a rapidly changing international and domestic landscape.</p><p>MP Foo Cexiang (Tanjong Pagar GRC) and Nominated MP Sanjeev Tiwari asked how the public service was preparing its officers amid a changed global landscape and Singapore’s economic transformation.</p><p>Mr Chan outlined three core priorities for public officers – understanding the world, understanding the people, and understanding technology – which he said they would have to do well to ensure Singapore remains exceptional.</p><p>Given how small and open Singapore is, and how everything from trade to security and food is affected by global developments, it is crucial for public officers to understand the new world order to make sound decisions for Singapore, he said.</p><p>To help them build up global exposure and connections, the public service has ramped up overseas postings and attachments to international organisations and the private sector, he added.</p><p>As a result, nearly four out of 10 officers in the central leadership development programmes have had structured overseas exposure, he said.</p><p>Mr Chan also stressed the importance of understanding technology as the Government enhances science, technology and engineering capabilities across the entire public service.</p><p>As part of this push, all public officers are <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mandatory-ai-literacy-course-for-all-public-servants-leaders-must-be-open-to-using-ai-dpm-gan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:required to go through digital and AI training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">required to go through digital and AI training</a>, he added, with training for senior leaders accelerating over the past year to ensure readiness at every level, from permanent secretaries down to the newest officers.</p><p>At the same time, the public service is launching supplementary programmes under the Career Fitness Movement to provide targeted support for officers at different career and life stages, he added.</p><p>Mr Chan said the public service has also worked to further strengthen trust with Singaporeans, through initiatives such as the Singapore Government Partnerships Office, which was set up to foster collaboration between the Government and citizens. It received more than 1,600 partnership proposals in 2025.</p><p>“To ensure Singapore is ready for the future, our public service will equip our officers to understand the world, understand our people and understand technology,” he added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ministers-decisions-carefully-recorded-to-build-up-body-of-knowledge-says-chan-chun-sing?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

He could not go to school with White children who played nearby. And only three percent of eligible Black voters in the South were registered to vote.</p><p>Like so many others of his generation, Jesse Jackson’s introduction to public life came through the Black church. There, he learned to lead and to reach the souls of those touched by his voice. He was mentored at the feet of a generation of men who saw the moral imperative of justice. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/us/reverend-jesse-jackson-death?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:His death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">His death</a> signals that their time with us is ending quickly.</p><p>There are so many things that are improbable about Jesse Jackson’s life. Born to an unwed, teen mother in the Jim Crow South, he emerged from that upbringing with a sense of uncommon purpose. He took that drive and embedded himself in the heart of the civil rights movement to become the youngest of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s staffers. In the 1970s, he branched out on his own to launch Operation PUSH.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"American civil rights leader and politician Rev.

With its mission of advancing the economic liberation of Black Americans and the poor, Jackson’s group quickly became a civil rights organization that had few equals in its ability to extract material changes to the practices of the monied power brokers in American society who still sought to keep Black Americans shut out of the nation’s economic life. His economic covenants opened the doors to corporate positions, franchises and real ownership for Black Americans for decades.</p><p>But perhaps the most improbable thing about Jackson’s life is his longevity.</p><p>For most of the six decades that he spent in public life, the spectre of death hung over him as it had for so many prominent Black men who were gunned down in their prime years. King was killed at 39. Medgar Evers at 37. Fred Hampton at 21.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>And yet, despite this reality, and the constant stream of threats he and his family faced, Jackson remained out front.

Jim Crow style barriers to the ballot box are gone. Black Americans can be CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and owners of banks and businesses nation-wide. A Black man has been elected president, and a Black and South Asian woman elected vice president. But without the effort of Jackson and others of his generation, none of that may have come to be.</p><p>There is another lesson in Jackson’s life work and in the work of the civil rights movement that finally forced America to live up to its founding principles. It was never only for the benefit of Black Americans that they marched and sat-in and saw the insides of jail cells. It was for all Americans: women, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and so many others who subsequently benefited from their work.</p><p>In 1984, when Jackson ran for president the first time, his improbable campaign was a warning shot to a political establishment that had for decades accepted the votes of its constituent groups, but had not been willing to fully share power.</p><p>“We are members of the party and we don’t want to leave,” Jackson told his fellow Democrats. “But our self-respect is non-negotiable.”</p><p>He was, without question, powered by the support of ordinary Black Americans. They were the first to see themselves in him – an ordinary man from the South who chose to do extraordinary things. But he offered a path forward for the entire nation that left the divisions of the past behind.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Rev.

America, our time has come,” he said on the stage of the Democratic National Convention in 1984.</p><p>With his 1984 and 1988 campaigns, Jackson altered the fabric of the Democratic Party. Like many outsider candidates, he ran against the establishment. And though he didn’t win the nomination, history shows that in many ways he was prescient in his brand of populist politics and his advocacy of many issues that later became mainstream.</p><p>The Democratic Party that Jackson ran in was one with delegate rules that were meant to keep candidates like him from the nomination. By changing those rules, he created the conditions that Barack Obama utilized <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/27/dnc.main?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:to win the nomination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">to win the nomination</a> in his history-making 2008 presidential bid.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By AJ Vicens, Hina Suzuki and Kentaro Sugiyama</p><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - In the days surrounding Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s February election win, several dozen X accounts linked to a Chinese misinformation campaign attacked her deeply conservative views and hawkish approach to China, said a U.S. research institute focused on national security and foreign ‌policy.</p><p>The 35 accounts, along with nine channels on the microblogging site Tumblr, pushed corruption allegations and portrayed Takaichi as illegitimate and militaristic. The accounts suggest the prime minister ‌is a reckless &quot;cult-backed&quot; leader driving Japan toward war, said Maria Riofrio, a researcher with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy&#39;s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation.</p><p>The accounts, part of a network of at least 327 X and other social media ​accounts, have since December or earlier attacked adversaries of Beijing or pushed pro-China policy positions, and targeted human rights organizations and sought to influence domestic politics in Japan, the United States, the Philippines and Latin America, according to a new analysis by Riofrio.</p><p>A spokesperson for Takaichi said her office is aware of suspicious foreign social media accounts that have posted content related to Japan&#39;s elections.</p><p>&quot;We consider this to be a national security threat that undermines the very foundations of democracy, including the fairness of elections and freedom of the press. We believe that countermeasures must be urgently prioritized.&quot;</p><p>Spokesperson Liu Pengyu for the ‌Chinese Embassy in Washington said the &quot;analysis&quot; by the FDD was &quot;groundless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Chinese ⁠government consistently opposes and combats the use of fake accounts and other tactics to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation,&quot; Liu said in a statement to Reuters.</p><p>&quot;We urge the relevant parties to stop making unfounded accusations and smearing others based on speculation.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Riofrio identified the most recent campaign as a distinct ⁠cluster based on its pro-China narratives that has coordinated on messaging content containing overlapping hashtags and other similarities. The cluster is likely part of long-running Chinese information operations that internet security analysts have dubbed Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, she said.</p><p>Although engagement with the material is low, users do see the content in social media feeds and the operators work algorithms to boost the content. One tweet that accused Takaichi of being in ​a ​cult, for example, received only two likes but was viewed more than 1,000 times.</p><p>The activity demonstrates &quot;China has the ​political will to interfere in Japanese elections and internal affairs,&quot; Riofrio said, ‌noting that the overall cluster has similar operations targeting other countries, including the United States.</p><p>The FDD is a Washington-based nonprofit focused on &quot;strengthening U.S. national security and reducing or eliminating threats posed by adversaries and enemies of the United States and other free nations,&quot; according to its website.</p><p>ATTACKS ON TRUMP, ASIA-PACIFIC NATIONS</p><p>The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier this week on another set of suspected foreign-backed online operations attacking the Japanese elections.</p><p>Riofrio said nearly half of the 327 accounts attacked U.S. President Donald Trump, pushing the narrative that his drug and border policies have worsened America&#39;s fentanyl crisis, reversing gains made during the Biden era, while also deflecting blame from China, according to the FDD analysis.</p><p>In a coordinated sequence of messaging in early February on Trump and fentanyl, six accounts, despite having fewer ‌than 10 followers each, attracted hundreds of likes, retweets and replies and nearly 18,000 views as of February ​12, Riofrio said.</p><p>One account in the network, FentanylFreeA, created in December 2025, Riofrio said, seemingly seeks to emulate the ​U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s Fentanyl Free America campaign, using a similar name and identical ​imagery. The account attacks both the U.S. and India, which it blames as the source of fentanyl precursor drugs.</p><p>Neither the White House or the DEA responded ‌to a request for comment.</p><p>The operations known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge have ​been active since at least 2017 and have ​repeatedly targeted audiences around the world over the years, according to experts.</p><p>A spokesperson for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group said Dragonbridge is the most prolific pro-PRC information operations operator that it tracks as of early 2026 based on “its massive scale and assertive narrative agenda.”</p><p>Dragonbridge, while maintaining a foundational focus on targeting the U.S., overseas dissidents, government critics and international NGOs, ​has become notably more assertive in the Asia-Pacific, the Google spokesperson ‌said, including by targeting the political leadership of Japan, Japan-Taiwan relations, Vietnam over its South China Sea activities, India and the Philippine administration.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/openai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:OpenAI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">OpenAI</a> on Wednesday reported that ​it had disrupted attempts in mid-October by a Chinese law enforcement official to help plan a multi-stage information attack on Takaichi.</p><p>(Reporting by AJ Vicens in Detroit; Additional ​reporting by Kentaro Sugiyama and Hina Suzuki in Tokyo; Editing by Chris Sanders and Tom Hogue)</p></div></article></div>",

global superconnector\" and \"regained its position as the world's leading venue for IPOs\" (Peter PARKS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Hong Kong&#39;s stock exchange reported record profits for the second consecutive year on Thursday, after the finance hub topped the global rankings for initial public offerings in 2025.</p><p>Profit attributable to shareholders rose 36 percent to US$2.3 billion, while total revenue and other income jumped 30 percent to also hit a peak of US$3.7 billion.</p><p>Core business revenue climbed 32 percent from the previous year, thanks to increases in trading and clearing fees driven by record volumes across capital markets.</p><p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) chairman Carlson Tong said the performance was driven by &quot;strong interest and increasing participation of international and Chinese Mainland investors, amid the ongoing dynamic macro backdrop&quot;.</p><p>&quot;In 2025, HKEx reinforced its role as a global superconnector, regained its position as the world&#39;s leading venue for IPOs and set new trading as well as financial performance records,&quot; chief executive Bonnie Chan said.</p><p>The firm expects volatility to &quot;persist amid the prevailing macro landscape in 2026&quot;, she added.</p><p>But she said there was cause for optimism in capital markets as global investors seek diversification and risk management opportunities in Asian and Chinese assets.</p><p>HKEx&#39;s net investment income is expected to be affected in part by interest rate movement and the redemptions from the external portfolio, Herbert Hui, the exchange&#39;s chief financial officer, said Thursday.</p><p>- Behind the surge -</p><p>Hong Kong&#39;s IPO market welcomed 119 new listings and raised a total of US$36.7 billion in 2025, a 226 percent year-over-year increase.</p><p>Dozens of companies from China piled into the city last year to raise overseas capital thanks to policy support from Beijing and optimised listing rules by Hong Kong regulators.</p><p>The renewed interest in Chinese assets is partly because investors are seeking alternatives outside of the US market and are realising &quot;that the performance of some sectors in China aren&#39;t as bad as the feeble wider economy suggest&quot;, China-focused economist Kelvin Lam told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But over exposure to Chinese companies may pose potential risk to Hong Kong&#39;s equity market, as they &quot;can be volatile at times through policy and regulatory changes, sometimes not very transparent,&quot; said Lam, who works for Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p><p>The exchange operator is processing more than 400 listing applications, HKEx&#39;s database shows.</p><p>Amid the surge, Hong Kong&#39;s market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said in late January it had directed 13 IPO sponsors to conduct internal reviews to &quot;rectify serious deficiencies&quot; in preparing listing documents.</p><p>The related behaviours also include sponsors&#39; misconduct and significant mismanagement of resources.</p><p>The contacted sponsors are handling 70 percent of IPO applications in Hong Kong.</p><p>Earlier this month, exchange head Bonnie Chan told reporters the review request was a &quot;friendly reminder&quot; from the regulators.</p><p>She said Thursday that HKEx will continue to roll out listing rules to &quot;support the development of the real economy&quot;.</p><p>HKEx is also dedicated to improving its market&#39;s structure and efficiency, including shortening stock clearing time, she said.</p><p>She added the bourse operator would &quot;carefully consider&quot; market calls to broaden the scope of confidential IPO filings. She did not provide details.</p><p>In his annual budget on Wednesday, the city&#39;s finance chief Paul Chan said the exchange would continue to explore establishing a multi‑asset post‑trade securities platform to cover China and Hong Kong equity and debt markets.</p><p>Shares in HKEx were up 0.78 percent on Thursday.</p><p>twa/lga</p></div></article></div>",
