heads of Korea&#39;s biggest companies on the sidelines of the APEC summit.</p><p>South Korea is home to two of the world&#39;s leading memory chip makers -- Samsung Electronics and SK hynix -- which manufacture chips essential for artificial intelligence products and the data centres that the fast-evolving industry relies on.</p><p>President Lee has also expressed his hope the country can become a leading AI power.</p><p>Nvidia said it was &quot;working with South Korea to expand the nation&#39;s AI infrastructure with over a quarter-million Nvidia GPUs across its sovereign clouds and AI factories&quot;.</p><p>Under Friday&#39;s deal, 50,000 of the graphics processing units will go towards a new &quot;AI factory&quot; being built by Samsung Electronics.</p><p>&quot;By deploying more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs, AI will be embedded throughout Samsung&#39;s entire manufacturing flow,&quot; the Korean tech giant said.</p><p>SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group will also receive 50,000 chips for use in AI facilities.</p><p>NAVER Cloud -- which operates South Korea&#39;s largest search engine -- will receive 60,000 to expand its AI infrastructure.</p><p>A further 50,000 will be deployed across Seoul&#39;s National AI Computing Center and to cloud service and IT providers.</p><p>&quot;Korea&#39;s leadership in technology and manufacturing positions is at the heart of the AI industrial revolution -- where accelerated computing infrastructure becomes as vital as power grids and broadband,&quot; Nvidia CEO Huang said.</p><p>- Chicken and chips -</p><p>Huang has sought to forge closer ties with South Korean tech giants in his visit to the country this week.</p><p>He met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun on Thursday for

Netflix&#39;s megahit &quot;Squid Game&quot; and meaning &quot;friend&quot; -- was intended to highlight the spirit of friendship underpinning their AI and chip collaborations.</p><p>Nvidia in July became the first company to top $4 trillion in market capitalisation, and followed that up by becoming the first to hit $5 trillion following a company event on Tuesday where it announced new ventures building on its AI technology.</p><p>Its chips drive much of the global AI industry and even featured in talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Gyeongju this week.</p><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power AI systems.</p><p>Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Its chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;We did discuss chips,&quot; Trump said after meeting Xi, adding that Huang would speak to Beijing about the dispute.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re sort of the arbitrator or the referee,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>hs-cdl-oho/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

have hoped for an impromptu talk with his old friend Kim Jong Un during a recent trip to Asia, but analysts say the increasingly emboldened North Korean despot had few good reasons to join the photo-op.</p><p>Trump sent repeated overtures to Kim during his barnstorming tour of Asia, saying he was &quot;100 percent&quot; open to a meeting and even bucking decades of US policy by conceding that North Korea was &quot;sort of a nuclear power&quot;.</p><p>But Pyongyang kept mum on the invitation, instead firing off missiles and sending its foreign minister to Russia and Belarus, with whom it has deepened ties in recent years.</p><p>&quot;The brutal reality is that Kim Jong Un had no incentive to participate,&quot; said Seong-Hyon Lee, a visiting scholar at the Harvard University Asia Center.</p><p>&quot;It was a fundamental miscalculation by Washington to believe he would,&quot; said Lee.</p><p>Trump&#39;s repeated overtures instead represented a &quot;victory&quot; for the North Korean leader -- offering him and his nuclear program a massive degree of credibility, Lee said.</p><p>&quot;President Trump gave Kim a massive, unearned concession,&quot; he explained.</p><p>The pair -- who Trump once famously declared were &quot;in love&quot; -- last met in 2019 at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas after the US leader extended an invitation to Kim on Twitter.</p><p>That overture to Pyongyang spearheaded by Trump eventually collapsed over the scope of denuclearisation of the North and sanctions relief.</p><p>Since then, North Korea has declared itself an &quot;irreversible&quot; nuclear state and forged close links to Russia, sending troops to support Moscow in its war on Ukraine.</p><p>Kim is now in a &quot;pretty sweet spot&quot;, Soo Kim, a former CIA analyst, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Russia&#39;s backing is probably one of the most decisive factors strengthening and cementing North Korea&#39;s strategic hand these days,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;He maintains the upper hand, which makes it easier for him to pass on Trump&#39;s invitation,&quot; Kim told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Heading home from South Korea and a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Trump said he had been too &quot;busy&quot; to meet Kim, though he added he could return.</p><p>The scene stood in stark contrast to 2019, when denuclearisation and sanctions relief talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, collapsed in dramatic fashion -- leaving Kim to endure a long train journey back to Pyongyang with no deal in hand.</p><p>Vladimir Tikhonov, Korean Studies professor at the University of Oslo, told AFP that experience had left Pyongyang sore.</p><p>&quot;They don&#39;t want to venture forward too rushingly,&quot; he said.</p><p>Instead, Tikhonov said, Pyongyang may be holding out for more specific proposals from Trump, including formal diplomatic recognition and sanctions relief without denuclearisation.</p><p>- Friends like these -</p><p>And closer alliances elsewhere mean Kim has little reason to chase approval from Washington.</p><p>This week, Pyongyang&#39;s foreign minister Choe Son Hui headed to Moscow, where she and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to strengthen bilateral ties.</p><p>Analysts say North Korea is receiving extensive financial aid, military technology, and food and energy assistance from Russia.</p><p>That has allowed it to sidestep tough international sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programmes that were once a crucial bargaining chip for the United States.</p><p>Freeflowing trade with China -- which soared to its highest level in nearly six years last month, according to analysts -- has also helped ease Pyongyang&#39;s economic isolation.</p><p>Last month, Kim appeared alongside Xi Jinping and Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin at an elaborate military parade in Beijing -- a striking display of his new, elevated status in global politics.</p><p>Kim now has &quot;no reason to trade this new, high-status quo for a photo-op&quot; with Trump, said Harvard&#39;s Lee.</p><p>Kim has a &quot;strategic lifeline from Russia and China, and he sees the US-China competition as a long-term guarantee of his own maneuverability.&quot;</p><p>The North Korean leader is now operating from a &quot;position of strength&quot;.</p><p>cdl/oho/cwl</p></div></article></div>",

SANOGO)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Forest ranger Daouda Bamba is in no doubt about who the apex predator is in Ivory Coast&#39;s Comoe National Park, ravaged by war and unrest between 2002 and 2011.</p><p>&quot;The most dangerous animal here is man,&quot; the lieutenant told AFP, while at the head of a 10-strong patrol on the lookout for hostile intruders.</p><p>Founded as a big game reserve in 1926, Comoe long ranked among Africa&#39;s most beautiful natural parks.</p><p>Tourists flocked by the thousands to catch a glimpse of its elephants, lions, leopards and herds of antelope and hippopotamuses.</p><p>But that status came under threat during Comoe&#39;s lost decade, when the government abandoned the park during the west African country&#39;s two civil wars, leaving its rich fauna and flora at the mercy of looters and poachers.</p><p>Yet while Bamba&#39;s militia still has to guard against the threat of unscrupulous humans, Comoe has made strides towards recovering from its close brush with destruction in the years since.</p><p>On a rare reporting mission to the reserve in Ivory Coast&#39;s far&nbsp;northeast, near the border with jihadist-riven Burkina Faso, an AFP team saw antelopes frolicking, clans of barking baboons and families of warthogs with snouts to the ground across its vast and nigh-on-pristine expanse.</p><p>- &#39;Vultures circling&#39; -</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re seeing lots of animals. The park&#39;s getting better,&quot; said Bamba, one of 160 rangers working for the Ivorian Parks and Reserves Office (OIPR) in Comoe.</p><p>&quot;Since we upped our game in 2016, the animals have been at peace. They don&#39;t run away all the time, which means they&#39;re not being hunted anymore.&quot;</p><p>However, the Kalashnikov slung over Bamba&#39;s shoulder, as well as the truncheons and tear gas grenades hanging from the rangers&#39; belts, are hints that not all is well in paradise.</p><p>&quot;When we catch intruders, it often leads to a brawl,&quot; the lieutenant said.</p><p>&quot;Three major threats hang over the park,&quot; Bamba said, namely &quot;poaching, illegal gold mining and unlawful livestock herding&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Nearby, one of his deputies tinkered with a drone, a useful tool when tasked with detecting human activity across the park&#39;s 11,500 square kilometres (4,440 square miles).</p><p>Often, however, the rangers have to resort to old-school means.</p><p>&quot;Our day-to-day is spent on foot. We&#39;re on the lookout for smoke from a fire, tracks from bicycles or motorcycles, or vultures circling overhead,&quot; said Bamba.</p><p>In 2024, 125 people were arrested in the park, including 105 gold diggers and 18 poachers, according to the OIPR.</p><p>- &#39;Nearly died&#39; -</p><p>Raynald Gilon&#39;s voice trembled as the old bushman remembered Comoe&#39;s glory days.</p><p>&quot;We had a fabulous era here. The wildlife was magnificent,&quot; said the grizzled Belgian, who has spent half a century guarding the park.</p><p>Hyenas and&nbsp;red hartebeest roamed its sun-baked savannahs, while Nile crocodiles and fishing eagles alike plunged into the waters of the Comoe River, which gave the park its name.</p><p>Comoe welcomed &quot;up to 6,000 to 7,000 tourists each season, most of them Europeans who arrived here by plane&quot;, he remembered.</p><p>At the park&#39;s northwest point, the dusty Kafolo Safari Lodge&#39;s crumbling stone entrance and abandoned blue-bottomed swimming pool serve as a reminder of that bygone age, long left to rot.</p><p>When the crisis began in 2002, the park found itself deep within territory controlled by the rebels who were fighting to overthrow then-president Laurent Gbagbo.</p><p>With the rangers forced to flee, the park was left exposed to the whims of the poachers, gold diggers and farmers.</p><p>&quot;It was a massacre, a real ransacking,&quot; lamented Raynald Gilon.</p><p>&quot;Everyone was taking part in the looting, including the rebels who claimed to be protecting it!&quot;</p><p>Within a year of the war&#39;s outbreak, UNESCO added the park to its list of endangered World Heritage sites.</p><p>&quot;The Comoe park nearly died,&quot; he said.</p><p>- &#39;Target of greed&#39; -</p><p>When Ivory Coast&#39;s crisis ended in 2011, the new government worked to fix the damage done, pouring funds into equipping and training up guards tasked with flushing out the poachers.</p><p>&quot;All of this allows us to really monitor the park and restore peace and quiet for the wildlife,&quot; said Commander Henri Tra Bi Zah, one of the park&#39;s managers.</p><p>Those efforts bore fruit. In 2017, UNESCO removed Comoe from its endangered heritage site list, in a first for an African park.</p><p>Three herds of elephants have been spotted, with a total of 200 individuals, while the chimpanzee has made a comeback.</p><p>Although the lion and the African wild dog are both believed to be locally extinct, leopards, spotted hyenas and even the caracal cat are a common sight in Comoe.</p><p>Antelopes and buffalo number by the thousands.</p><p>That said, those hoping to catch a glimpse of the park&#39;s rarer beasts have to venture deep into the savannah, often while braving thick swarms of biting tsetse flies, the AFP team observed.</p><p>While insisting that the &quot;biggest problem&quot; of illegal gold mining has been &quot;contained&quot;, Commander Tra Bi Zah warned that the park &quot;is still the target of greed because it is brimming with resources&quot;.</p><p>- Return of the tourist? -</p><p>Nearby villagers seem to be respecting the park&#39;s boundaries.</p><p>&quot;Hand on heart we can&#39;t enter. If they catch you in there, you&#39;ll go straight to jail,&quot; said a farmer from Bambela, whose hut lies just a few metres from the edge of the savannah.</p><p>The OIPR even has hopes to revive tourism to make the park &quot;a driving force for socioeconomic development&quot; in the Ivorian northeast.</p><p>Those hopes, however, are complicated by the park&#39;s proximity to Burkina Faso, which is locked in conflict with fighters linked to Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group. Western governments have advised against all travel to the region as a result.</p><p>That said, no jihadist has been arrested or even spotted recently in the park, according to security sources questioned by AFP.</p><p>A new hotel has sprung up in Kafolo to welcome humanitarian workers, civil engineers or even the odd foreigner passing through, its walls adorned with hunting trophies from the big game era of yore.</p><p>&quot;The park is struggling to recover from the disaster... The revival is fragile,&quot; said local deputy Abdoulaye Karim Diomande.</p><p>&quot;But the OIPR is making great strides. The future looks bright.&quot;</p><p>hba/pid/sbk/giv</p></div></article></div>",

raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued just before Trump -- who boasts frequently about being a peace president --&nbsp;went into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>Trump&#39;s announcement left much unanswered -- chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>The directive appeared to alarm Iran, whose foreign minister called it &quot;regressive and irresponsible&quot; and a threat to international security.</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>Japanese atomic bomb survivors group Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan on Friday.</p><p>The directive &quot;directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable,&quot; the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group said in the letter obtained by AFP.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly,&quot; but did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><p>The president&#39;s statement &quot;speaks for itself,&quot; Vance told reporters at the White House.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an important part of American national security to make sure that this nuclear arsenal we have actually functions properly, and that&#39;s part of a testing regime,&quot; he added.</p><p>It came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>- Not &#39;a nuclear test&#39; -</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations with Russia and China on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W.

upend efforts on Capitol Hill to bring an end to the weekslong funding impasse.

Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”</p><p>At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.</p><p>But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.</p><p>“Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.</p><p>The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:longest-ever government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">longest-ever government shutdown</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/snap-benefits-food-stamps-explainer?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Critical food aid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Critical food aid</a> for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

31.</figcaption></div></figure><p>GYEONGJU, South Korea – The collective leadership of Apec’s 21 economies is needed to reform and strengthen the World Trade Organisation (WTO) so that it stays effective and relevant, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.</p><p>While the WTO is not perfect, countries should not seek to abandon the trade body, but rather to improve it, he said on Oct 31 at a session of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM), which runs from Oct 31 to Nov 1 in Gyeongju, South Korea.</p><p>Noting that 2025’s meeting was taking place amid multilateralism under pressure and a global economy facing headwinds, PM Wong called on Apec members to support new mechanisms for “outcome-oriented decision-making” at the WTO, as its current consensus principles have become a recipe for paralysis.</p><p>They should also embrace flexible multilateralism, so that like-minded countries can move first to respond to new and emerging issues, while others can join when they are ready, he added.</p><p>PM Wong’s remarks came days after WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called for reform of the trade body’s consensus rule, which requires unanimous agreement among its 166 members to secure global trade deals.</p><p>A new approach is needed, particularly as the global trading system is undergoing its largest disruption in eight decades, Dr Okonjo-Iweala said on Oct 28.</p><p>On Oct 31, PM Wong echoed calls by other Apec leaders to lend their political support to launch the reform process when WTO members meet in Cameroon in March 2026. The meeting, which takes place every two years, is the highest decision-making platform for the 30-year-old trade body.</p><p>“Apec was founded with the mission to champion free and open trade and investments in the Asia-Pacific region,” he noted. “This mission is now more important than ever, and it is our collective leadership that will enable us to achieve this.”</p><p>PM Wong also outlined other ways for Apec economies to shore up the rules-based multilateral trading system.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>For instance, cooperation across different trade groupings should be stepped up to move closer to countries’ longer-term goal of a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific.</p><p>He noted that there are already comprehensive free trade deals like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).</p><p>“These are important building blocks, and we should build bridges between them to promote interoperability,” he said.</p><p>The CPTPP is a free trade agreement first signed in 2018 which now has 12 members, including Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico. It evolved out of a smaller grouping founded by Singapore along with three other Apec nations: Chile, New Zealand and Brunei.</p><p>PM Wong also cited sectoral agreements like the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (Depa) and<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-chile-and-new-zealand-launch-negotiations-for-a-new-green-trade-pact\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the world’s first Green Economy Partnership Agreement (Gepa),;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> the world’s first Green Economy Partnership Agreement (Gepa),</a> which he said can bring about a gradual alignment of standards and rules in these new areas.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"(Seated from left) Chile’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Alberto van Klaveren, Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability and Environment and Minister in Charge of Trade Relations Grace Fu and New Zealand’s Minister for Trade and Investment Todd McClay signing the Gepa on Oct 31.

South Korea joined as the fourth member in 2024, and China is among nine other economies keen to be included.</p><p>Several small, trade-dependent economies like Singapore have also started new platforms, such as the Future of Investment and Trade Partnership.</p><p>Apec can nurture these initiatives and scale up the promising ones so that the region remains open, connected and conducive for trade and investments, said PM Wong.</p><p>Apec economies should also explore practical projects with the private sector in areas like trade facilitation, he added.</p><p>Simplifying and digitising trade processes is a concrete way to remove red tape and reduce business costs, and PM Wong said he looked forward to the establishment of an Apec Centre of Excellence for Paperless Trade.</p><p>“We can transform Apec into a paperless trade region, driving efficiency while accelerating sustainability and integration,” he said.</p><p>While these are uncertain times, PM Wong said Apec can make a difference by embracing cooperation, being pragmatic and staying forward-looking.</p><p>“Doing so will deliver tangible outcomes for our economies, while reinforcing the rules-based global order,” he said. “Singapore looks forward to working with all Apec economies to build an international system that benefits everyone.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/apec-leadership-needed-to-reform-wto-keep-it-relevant-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.</p><p>Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Amiram Cooper was kidnapped in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, and later declared dead by Israeli authorities. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sBBh7P2oxerlWMNX2JENqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/76edca5aa93b6f38aa844f3996978395><noscript><img alt=\"Amiram Cooper was kidnapped in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, and later declared dead by Israeli authorities. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sBBh7P2oxerlWMNX2JENqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/76edca5aa93b6f38aa844f3996978395 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Amiram Cooper was kidnapped in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, and later declared dead by Israeli authorities. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Sahar Baruch was also kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3QXdVmoPAriHlTPdOHpVyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/1d4d7006753a2e739b9aa4e514578efc><noscript><img alt=\"Sahar Baruch was also kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3QXdVmoPAriHlTPdOHpVyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/1d4d7006753a2e739b9aa4e514578efc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Sahar Baruch was also kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. - Courtesy of Bring Them Home Now/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><p>The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional development. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
