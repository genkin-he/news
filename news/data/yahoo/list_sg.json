citing &quot;increasing pressure and risks&quot;.</p><p>The All About Macau Media (AAMacau) news platform, co-founded by late journalist Ng Sio Ngai more than a decade ago, has often been critical of social issues in the Chinese city.</p><p>AAMacau, whose Chinese-language name means &quot;discuss as much as possible&quot;, runs digital and print platforms and also has a social media presence.</p><p>The outlet said this month&#39;s print edition would be its last, with the rest of its operation to end in December.</p><p>It said it had been told by Macau officials that it &quot;no longer meets the statutory requirements to engage in relevant activities&quot; under the Chinese special administrative region&#39;s media law and that its monthly publication registration number has been revoked.</p><p>&quot;Facing resource constraints, mounting external pressures, and the need for our reporters to navigate judicial proceedings, the team found it increasingly difficult to maintain reporting standards,&quot; AAMacau said.</p><p>It said it &quot;had no choice but to make this difficult decision&quot;.</p><p>In April, two AAMacau reporters were detained by police while covering an event in the city&#39;s legislature, which it said was the first case of its kind in Macau.</p><p>It said on Thursday that three of its journalists could face criminal charges over the incident.</p><p>The city&#39;s Government Information Bureau has not yet responded to an AFP request for comment.</p><p>- &#39;Swift deterioration&#39; -</p><p>Macau, which has its own legal system largely based on Portuguese law, enacted national security legislation in 2009 and widened its powers in 2023.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists said the closure of AAMacau is &quot;a blow to press freedom and a highly troubling development&quot;.</p><p>It &quot;marks a swift deterioration&quot; in Macau&#39;s media environment, the advocacy group told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

in a local newspaper in 2010, AAMacau established its website about two years later, followed by the first monthly magazine printed in May 2013.</p><p>In recent years, the outlet has transitioned into a subscription and donation-based funding model.</p><p>AAMacau said its decision came about a year after it started facing restrictions in accessing government events.</p><p>Political scientist and veteran journalist Eric Sautede called the outlet&#39;s closure an &quot;absolute loss&quot;.</p><p>He said AAMacau had &quot;helped foster a measure of accountability among those in power -- both in government and in the private sector&quot;.</p><p>twa/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump landed back in the United States Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued right as Trump was going into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>And it came days after Russia declared it had tested a nuclear-capable cruise missile and a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable sea drone.</p><p>The blunt statement from Trump, who boasts frequently about being a &quot;peace&quot; president, left much unanswered.</p><p>Chiefly, it was unclear whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions -- something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Regardless, the statement amounted to unusual nuclear sabre rattling.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>None of that appeared to be true.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- said China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. &quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the US do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus responded that she would introduce legislation to &quot;put a stop&quot; to any move at restoring live weapons testing in her state.</p><p>And Senator Jacky Rosen, also a Democrat, said on X that Trump&#39;s statement &quot;directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees... who&#39;ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen &amp; is unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>burs-sms/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona is appearing with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.</p><p>Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.</p><p>Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.</p><p>But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep.

His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.</p><p>Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F28%2Fpolitics%2Fnew-jersey-governor-latino-vote-trump-ciattarelli-sherrill&amp;data=05%7C02%7CArlette.Saenz%40cnn.com%7C2b7b13281e57419b770c08de17a07fed%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638974175268010246%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=mcGM5hs%2F3FfbDIi%2B8Njnfkh9m6YvxX62abjvAVDIDCE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Latino vote could be key;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Latino vote could be key</a> to picking the next governor.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Sen.

Gretchen Whitmer.</p><p>“The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/02/politics/cory-booker-democratic-party-trump-redistricting?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:New Jersey Sen.

It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.</p><p>Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.</p><p>Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide#toc-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to</a> the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>“There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.</p><p>“Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.</p><p>“All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.</p><p>China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.</p><p>China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/politics/china-suspected-silo-fields-report?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to the Federation of American Scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to the Federation of American Scientists</a>, and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/china/china-military-parade-analysis-intl-hnk-ml-dst?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a military parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a military parade</a> in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.</p><p>When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”</p><p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”</p><p>The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.</p><h3>A new arms race?</h3><p>Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.</p><p>The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.</p><p>But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.</p><p>“If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.</p><p>Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.</p><p>When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.</p><p>“I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”</p><p>A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”</p><p>The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.</p><p>North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.</p><p>After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/asia/nuclear-testing-china-russia-us-exclusive-intl-hnk-ml?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN reported in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN reported in 2023</a> that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>“There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p><em>CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The comments echoed those he made in August suggesting he might allow a 30% or 50% scaled-down version of Nvidia&#39;s top chip to China.</p><p>But, Fist said, the B30A is a version of the best Nvidia chip in different packaging: China could buy twice as many and get the same result, likely at the same price.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nvidia declined comment on the details about the chip.</p><p>In the paper, published on Saturday, Fist and his co-authors analyzed nine scenarios covering a range of export strategies the administration might take for a downgraded Blackwell chip.</p><p>BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIOS</p><p>In the best scenario, where no powerful chips are exported to China next year, the U.S. would have 30 times the AI computing power of China.</p><p>In the worst, where the U.S. allows the export of the B30A and comparable chips from other U.S. companies, China could surpass the U.S. in terms of how much AI computing power they gain in 2026.</p><p>Even in a median scenario, where a small amount of the chips is exported, the U.S. advantage shrinks to four times China&#39;s computing power, the analysis found.</p><p>&quot;If any meaningful quantities are allowed, it&#39;s a huge change,&quot; said Fist, director of emerging technology policy at the Institute for Progress, a Washington-based think tank. &quot;It&#39;s functionally ending the export control regime that we have today.&quot;</p><p>Chris McGuire, a national security and technology expert who served in the U.S. State Department until last summer, agreed.</p><p>&quot;If this chip is allowed to go, there are effectively no AI chip export controls anymore,&quot; McGuire said. &quot;The reason we have a big advantage on AI is because we have big advantages in computing power and in chips. If we give that away, best case is, it&#39;s like a tie. Worst case, we fall behind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We would be trading China our most advanced technology for soybean purchases,&quot; McGuire said.</p><p>(Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Chris Sanders, Franklin Paul, Daniel Wallis and Deepa Babington)</p></div></article></div>",

frustrating phone call with Joe Biden ahead of her debate with Donald Trump showed her that the former president wasn’t focused on her success – citing it as an example of why she has a “complicated” relationship with Biden.</p><p>“My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself,” she said on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast. “It wasn’t about my performance at the debate.”</p><p>Harris recounted the call, moments before her high-stakes confrontation with Trump, in which Biden told her “a group of people” were speaking poorly of her in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, “because they heard I was saying bad things about him.”</p><p>“I was told that he wanted to call so that I’d be ready,” Harris said. “‘I was so sure it was to buck me up and (say) ‘go get ‘em’ … When I hung up the phone I was just – it was unbelievable, and I was – yes I was angry, and deeply disappointed. It was so unnecessary.”</p><p>The podcast appearance, part of Harris’ media tour promoting her book “107 Days,” marked the former vice president’s latest candid conversation rehashing what happened during her brief and unsuccessful bid for the presidency, as well as the fallout from her loss.</p><p>Harris said she is still friends with Biden, who she said had called her two days earlier for her birthday.</p><p>“I have a great deal of affection for him, and there were times, that I’ve been quite candid about, where he greatly disappointed me and, frankly, angered me,” she said.</p><p>Harris also discussed her perception of Biden’s mental state leading up to his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Trump. Harris said in the interview that she didn’t think Biden actually wanted to hold the early general election debate, but was talked into it.</p><p>“It’s like any competition you go in, whether it’s you’re bidding for something, if it’s sports – you gotta want it, right?” Harris said. “If you don’t want to be in the competition it will absolutely have an impact on your performance, and I don’t think he – I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The former vice president also suggested that she is open to running for president again.</p><p>“I think the case for running again is if I can make a difference,” she said. “If I feel that I can offer something as president of the United States that would be not only uplifting to the American people, but would be about getting us on a correct trajectory.”</p><p>Harris was asked if she thinks she can offer such a message to the country.</p><p>“I mean, that’s why I ran the last time,” she said. “We’ll have to see what happens over the course of these next few months, several months.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
