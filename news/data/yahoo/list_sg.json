a crunch local poll result Friday that heaps pressure on&nbsp;unpopular Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Labour&nbsp;also&nbsp;finished behind the hard-right, anti-immigrant&nbsp;Reform UK party in the by-election for the parliamentary seat of Gorton and Denton in Manchester, as the country&#39;s traditional two-party system fractures.</p><p>The&nbsp;result&nbsp;in a seat that Labour has dominated for decades&nbsp;shows how the party is being squeezed by both ends of the political spectrum and&nbsp;is likely to increase chatter about how much longer the 63-year-old Starmer can stay in office.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons appear more willing to look towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>Labour won the constituency with almost 51 percent of the vote at the July 2024 general election that swept Starmer to power and ousted the Conservatives from 14 consecutive years in office.</p><p>But&nbsp;his&nbsp;government has since been beset by numerous policy reversals and several rows, including over the appointment of Peter Mandelson, an associate of&nbsp;late&nbsp;sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as Britain&#39;s ambassador to Washington.</p><p>- Unpopular Starmer -</p><p>Polls suggest Starmer is the most unpopular British prime minister since surveys began and

on lawmakers to address the issue of the monarchy&#39;s survival.</p><p>Only the male offspring of the male side of the family can currently ascend the ancient Chrysanthemum Throne.</p><p>Since Emperor Naruhito, 66, only has one daughter, hopes for continuing the imperial family lie with Prince Hisahito, the teenage son of Crown Prince Akishino.</p><p>Prime Minister Takaichi told parliament on Friday that a panel of experts in 2021 found it&nbsp;&quot;appropriate to limit eligibility to those who are male-line male descendants belonging to the imperial lineage&quot; and she respected their conclusion.</p><p>&quot;The government, and I, myself as well, respect this report,&quot; said Takaichi, the country&#39;s first woman prime minister.</p><p>She previously warned that revising the imperial family&#39;s succession rules was &quot;an urgent matter&quot;, although this would likely involve &quot;adopting&quot; new members.</p><p>Even though tradition dictates only a man can carry on the imperial line -- which goes back 2,600 years according to legend -- opinion polls have shown high public support for a woman taking the throne.</p><p>- &#39;Unbroken imperial line&#39; -</p><p>Japan has debated the royal succession rules for decades, with a key government panel in 2005 recommending that it pass to the oldest child regardless of sex.</p><p>That appeared to pave the way for the emperor&#39;s daughter, Princess Aiko, to rise to&nbsp;the throne. But the birth of Prince Hisahito the following year silenced the debate.</p><p>In 2021, a government-appointed expert panel advised the government to consider allowing the imperial family to &quot;adopt&quot; new male members -- distant relatives who could be brought back into the fold.</p><p>But it is unclear if those men would be willing to give up their careers and freedom to continue the royal lineage.</p><p>The panel also said royal daughters -- currently forced to leave the family after marriage -- could potentially continue their public duties after their nuptials.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Traditionalists have asserted that the &quot;unbroken imperial line&quot; of male succession is the foundation of Japan, and major changes would divide the nation.</p><p>Under the post-war constitution, the royal family holds no political power.</p><p>Historically, women who wed royals have faced intense pressure to produce sons and some family members are regular subjects of online and media gossip.</p><p>Empress Masako, a former high-flying diplomat, struggled for years with a stress-related illness after joining the household, which some have put down to the pressure to have a boy.</p><p>Empress Emerita Michiko, Naruhito&#39;s mother, also suffered stress-induced illnesses.</p><p>Hisahito&#39;s sister, Mako, married her university boyfriend, Kei Komuro.</p><p>She faced intense tabloid reporting over claims that Kei&#39;s family had run into financial difficulties, leading the former princess to develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

traded on the glamour of owning Harrods, the Paris Ritz and luxury yachts, but Mohamed Al-Fayed was at the centre of a dark web of alleged abuse, say French lawyers for women who liken him to US sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>French authorities began investigating the late Egyptian businessman and his brother Salah last year amid allegations of a vast system of sex trafficking and abuse on French soil.</p><p>&quot;Every time I met Mohamed Al-Fayed, he tried to assault me,&quot; his former personal assistant Kristina Svensson told French police of her two years working at the Ritz.</p><p>Her testimony is all too familiar.</p><p>The alleged crimes of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who died in 2023 aged 94, first came to light in a BBC investigation in September 2024. In it, several young women who worked at his upmarket London department store Harrods accused him of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>British police told AFP that 154 victims have so far come forward to say the former owner of Premier League club Fulham abused them.</p><p>His brother Salah, who died in 2010, is also accused.</p><p>But frustrated by London Metropolitan Police&#39;s investigation of the alleged crimes, which span more than 35 years, some victims have turned to France in the hope of finding justice.</p><p>&quot;In England they&#39;re ignoring the trafficking... They just want to make it about Al-Fayed and Harrods,&quot; said Rachael Louw, a former Al-Fayed employee, speaking for the first time about her ordeal.</p><p>The French investigation, however, is handled by &quot;a unit specialised in human trafficking,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>It is &quot;a relief that our cases are actually being recognised as trafficking&quot;.</p><p>- Consumed &#39;like meat&#39; -</p><p>Louw was 23 when her bosses sent her to Salah Fayed&#39;s yacht on the French Riviera. Now after 31 years she was able to testify about what happened there to French investigators on February 10.</p><p>Louw told AFP she was first &quot;spotted&quot; by Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1993 while working as a sales assistant at Harrods. Shortly after, she was placed on a management training scheme, which required her to submit to a medical exam by a Harley Street doctor before being employed by the chairman&#39;s office in the summer of 1994.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The medical appointment went far beyond a standard checkup, with a pelvic exam and &quot;thorough breast exam&quot;, smear and HIV tests.</p><p>And the results were not kept confidential.</p><p>The report, seen by AFP, was handed over to Harrods, and described Louw&#39;s personal life: her parents&#39; separation when she was young, her father living in the United States and the death of her mother and grandmother.</p><p>The doctor also noted that she took a birth control pill, had a boyfriend and was in &quot;excellent&quot; health.</p><p>The doctor &quot;sent confidential information to arm the rapist&quot;, said French lawyer Eva Joly, who is representing Louw and another former Al-Fayed assistant.</p><p>&quot;These young women were like meat, and they wanted to know if they were fit to consume,&quot; said Caroline Joly, another member of the legal team.</p><p>Several encounters were arranged between Louw and Salah Fayed at his home in London&#39;s glitzy Park Lane, where Louw said she was drugged with &quot;a crack cocaine mix&quot;.</p><p>Louw was then offered a job as an assistant to Salah in France and she was sent there by private jet.</p><p>She said she refused further drugs, &quot;and because he didn&#39;t push anymore, I thought it was okay&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;no&nbsp;reason&nbsp;not to trust&nbsp;this&nbsp;man... this&nbsp;was&nbsp;my&nbsp;first job&nbsp;from&nbsp;university.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;I didn&#39;t feel safe&#39; -</p><p>Staff confiscated her passport as she flew from London&#39;s Luton airport to his yacht. And once she arrived, &quot;nothing&quot; resembled the job she signed up for.</p><p>&quot;I thought I was supposed to be filing paperwork, making arrangements, organising office work,&quot; she said.</p><p>Instead &quot;there was no office, no normal working hours, no time off. I was expected to just be with him&quot;, she said.</p><p>Louw recalled appearing alongside Salah Fayed at dinners attended by elderly, wealthy men with &quot;young girls and lots of touching&quot;.</p><p>When she managed to call her boyfriend, who worked at Harrods, he was fired.</p><p>One night, Louw woke up to find Salah in her bed, claiming he was lonely, she said.</p><p>&quot;I went ramrod straight and the rest of the night I was awake just lying there petrified,&quot; she said, fearing any movement would be an invitation for him to touch her.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know what he would do to me... I didn&#39;t feel safe.&quot;</p><p>She saw other young women in the Fayeds&#39; orbit.</p><p>On a trip to Saint Tropez she encountered a red-headed &quot;young girl&quot;, possibly younger than herself, sunbathing on Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s yacht that was moored just off his villa. </p><p>&quot;Mohamed starts rubbing lotion all over this girl, she&#39;s wearing a bathing suit and then he started to kiss her,&quot; Louw told AFP.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything else&quot; of that day, she said, &quot;so I don&#39;t know if there were drugs, I can&#39;t say for sure whether I was drugged that afternoon,&quot; she added.</p><p>What jolted her to escape was the prospect of being trapped alone with Salah after he bought a speedboat with only one bedroom, telling her &quot;that he would take me to sail around the Italian coast&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I knew that if I went on that boat nothing good would happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Panicked, she booked the first Air France flight out and worked up the courage to ask for her passport back, which she received although it was clear Salah &quot;was very angry&quot;.</p><p>Home again, &quot;I had&nbsp;blocked out&quot; the details of what happened, she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to&nbsp;remember.&quot;</p><p>For decades she feared she was bound by a confidentiality agreement she had signed at her interview, but seeing other victims speak out against Al-Fayed in 2024, she reconsidered.</p><p>&quot;How can I be silent?&nbsp;There has to be a cost to what the perpetrators did. Because if they go unpunished, it emboldens the next man.</p><p>&quot;If we women do not speak up we become complicit in our own oppression... powerful men will never change a system that benefits them.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Organised system&#39; -</p><p>Despite the deaths of the brothers, the women hope investigators can still track down who enabled the trafficking network.</p><p>&quot;There is no such thing as a small piece of information. Every element is useful for the investigation,&quot; for Al-Fayed assistant Svensson said, calling on victims and witnesses to speak to police.</p><p>The Swedish woman arrived in France in 1993 and was placed by a temp agency at the Ritz in 1998, then owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed, as his assistant.</p><p>Svensson, aged 30 at the time, was to help him manage his affairs after the death of his son Dodi with Princess Diana in a Paris car crash, perceived as a prestigious assignment.</p><p>During her interview with the Ritz management, the questions posed were &quot;focused&quot; on her appearance and her personal background, she said, even pointing out that she was the &quot;spitting image&quot; of Al-Fayed&#39;s wife.</p><p>The Ritz then sent her to Harrods in London for an interview with Al-Fayed himself, and organised&nbsp;accommodation for her at a luxury residence he owned.</p><p>&quot;I had brought my CV. He wasn&#39;t interested in that. He only asked me personal questions.&quot;</p><p>What followed was a regular pattern of meetings with Al-Fayed. Svensson said she was left in a room alone for hours with no instruction, until he eventually arrived and she would endure sexual assault and attempted rape during which &quot;he&#39;d laugh&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hoped that in time he would see that I wasn&#39;t interested in him and that he would take me seriously,&quot; Svensson told police.</p><p>&quot;I was a foreigner, with no family or network in the country, no knowledge of French labour law, and no one to lean on financially if I quit.&quot;</p><p>In retrospect, Svensson compares herself to a closely watched &quot;luxury product&quot; which Al-Fayed wanted to possess -- &quot;a doll on a shelf&quot;.</p><p>Al-Fayed was born Mohamed Fayed in Alexandria, but later changed his surname to the grander Al-Fayed, while his brother kept the original family name.</p><p>-&nbsp;London investigation &#39;continues&#39; -</p><p>At the Ritz, she recalls that staff warned her that there were &quot;microphones and cameras in every corner&quot;. And at a villa in Saint Tropez, she said a housekeeper suggested that she block her bedroom door at night.</p><p>The Ritz Paris told AFP in a statement that it was &quot;deeply saddened by the testimonies and the allegations of abuse&quot; and that it is &quot;ready to fully cooperate with the judicial authorities. Our teams do not tolerate any form of inappropriate behaviour, which would be a serious breach of our code of conduct.</p><p>&quot;We want to express our deepest respect to the women who spoke out,&quot; it added.</p><p>Harrods said it &quot;continues to support the bravery of all women in coming forward. Their claims point to the breadth of abuse by Mohamed Fayed and again raise serious allegations against his brother, Salah Fayed. The picture that has emerged suggests that this pattern of abusive behaviour took place wherever they operated.&quot;</p><p>They said more than 180 survivors had already received counselling support through its independent advocate. The store also urged survivors to claim compensation through the Harrods Redress Scheme.</p><p>London&#39;s Metropolitan police said its &quot;investigation into those who could have facilitated or enabled Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s offending continues&quot; and urged victims to come forward.</p><p>&quot;The way the Met works has moved on immeasurably, and our teams have transformed the way we investigate rape and sexual offences.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for the two women say their testimony helps sketch the outlines of a &quot;powerful system&quot; of trafficking which resembles the one established during the same period by Epstein.</p><p>&quot;As with Epstein, with the Al-Fayeds there is a frenzied consumption of young women and an organised system to procure them,&quot; said lawyer Eva Joly, a former judge and European parliament member.</p><p>&quot;The pattern is the same: selecting vulnerable young women, transport, accommodation, isolation and money, which is used to intimidate or corrupt,&quot; she said.</p><p>And as with the Epstein case, while the statute of limitations may have expired, an investigation into the Al-Fayeds can still establish the facts and identify any victims whose cases could be still prosecuted.</p><p>&quot;We are only at the beginning of piecing the puzzle together in France,&quot; Joly insisted.</p><p>clw-fbe/giv/fg/jj</p></div></article></div>",

REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Maria Cheng</p><p>OTTAWA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives in Mumbai on Friday on his first official visit to India, hoping to reset the sometimes fractious relationship with the world&#39;s most populous country as he seeks new global alliances.</p><p>Carney will meet business leaders in Mumbai and start ‌talks on a comprehensive trade agreement, which is expected to be completed by November, his foreign minister told Reuters. He is scheduled to travel on to ‌New Delhi for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><p>Carney has sought closer ties with China and Middle Eastern countries as well as India, as he tries to reduce Canada&#39;s dependence on the United States and forge a ​new global trading order led by what he calls middle-power countries.</p><p>Relations between Canada and India soured several years ago after explosive allegations by then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the Indian government was linked to the assassination of a Canadian citizen who was also a prominent Sikh separatist. India has repeatedly denied any such links.</p><p>Unlike several previous Canadian leaders, including Trudeau, Carney will not make a stop in India&#39;s Punjab region, a major origin of Indian migration to Canada. Sikh separatists have pushed for an independent state in the Punjab and a visit there risks irking ‌Carney&#39;s Indian hosts.</p><p>Analysts say the move signals a more pragmatic foreign ⁠policy that aims to wean Canada away from the United States, spurred by President Donald Trump&#39;s tariff war and annexation threats.</p><p>&quot;The Prime Minister has a laser-beam focus on attracting capital to Canada, not playing to the Indian diaspora back home,&quot; said Goldy Hyder, president of the Business ⁠Council of Canada.</p><p>&quot;This is a business trip aimed at growing the economy to give Canadians more economic sovereignty,&quot; he said, calling the approach a significant shift from the Trudeau era.</p><p>Last month, the European Union and India reached a landmark trade deal to cut tariffs on most goods, raising expectations that India might soon sign a similar deal with Canada. India&#39;s high commissioner to Canada told Reuters ​in ​January that Carney will likely sign a 10-year, C$2.8 billion ($2.05 billion) uranium supply deal and smaller agreements ​on oil and gas, the environment, <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:artificial intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">artificial intelligence</a>, quantum computing, education and ‌culture.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>NO BHANGRA DANCING</p><p>Trudeau was mocked for wearing overly elaborate Indian outfits during a 2018 visit and was publicly criticized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allowing &quot;anti-India activities,&quot; a reference to vocal Sikh separatists living in Canada.</p><p>&quot;Carney has a sense of gravitas and is very strategic,&quot; said Partha Mohanram, a management professor at the University of Toronto. &quot;He&#39;s not going to do a bhangra dance over there.&quot;</p><p>But Carney&#39;s approach to India has drawn criticism from some Sikh groups in Canada.</p><p>&quot;The Carney government has failed to hold India accountable or to create any meaningful safeguards to ensure that Sikh Canadians are protected from foreign interference and transnational repression,&quot; the World Sikh Organization of Canada said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand told ‌Reuters there have been conversations between Canada and India at the highest levels regarding concerns about criminal ​activity with possible links to India. Anand said there were new measures to track criminal money, digital threats ​and surveillance of diaspora communities.</p><p>Anand said Carney&#39;s foreign policy was driven by the ​reordering of global trading relationships and that &quot;no country will ever have a pass in terms of the domestic safety and security of this country.&quot;</p><p>FENDING ‌OFF AMERICAN HEGEMONY</p><p>After India, Carney will visit Australia, where he will ​address parliament and discuss military, trade and defense ​links. En route back to Ottawa, Carney will meet Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and talk about boosting trade in autos, energy and critical minerals.</p><p>Jonathan Kalles, a former adviser to ex-Prime Minister Trudeau, said Carney&#39;s agenda was defined by the new geopolitical order he outlined in his Davos speech, where he called for middle powers ​to adopt a &quot;principled and pragmatic&quot; path to fend off American ‌hegemony.</p><p>&quot;When the world is nice and calm, you can try to change the world and talk about virtues,&quot; he said. &quot;But when you&#39;re living in uncertain times, ​the Prime Minister&#39;s job is to advance the country&#39;s interests and Mark Carney knows very well his job is to diversify our trade and strengthen ​the economy.&quot;</p><p>($1 = 1.3684 Canadian dollars)</p><p>(Reporting by Maria Cheng; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Edmund Klamann)</p></div></article></div>",

Jerry Nadler, the dean of the New York congressional delegation, and Assemblymember Micah Lasher said in a statement they were “disgusted and outraged,” calling the action dangerous and fear-inducing.</p><p>Mamdani, who was in Washington to discuss his housing initiatives with Trump, raised Aghayeva’s detention with the president and urged she be released, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.</p><p>“I shared my concerns about Columbia student Elmina Aghayeva, who was detained by ICE this morning,” Mamdani wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/2027129042432913711?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">on X</a>, shortly after their meeting.</p><p>Mamdani said Trump called him, writing: “He has just informed me that she will be released imminently.”</p><p>Aghayeva later shared on Instagram she had been released, saying she was “safe and okay,” and on her way home. “I am in complete shock over what happened … I need a little bit of time to process everything I will come back soon. But please don’t worry,” she wrote.</p><p>Columbia said <a href=\"https://x.com/Columbia/status/2027130847782977981\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:in a post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">in a post on X</a> that it was “relieved and thrilled” that Aghayeva was released. It said it is working to contact Aghayeva’s family and ensure the student has access to legal support.</p><p>Aghayeva is an international student and senior double majoring in neuroscience and political science, according to the American Association of University Professors.</p><p>She has amassed more than 100,000 followers on social media, regularly posting about her library study sessions, as well as her lifestyle and productivity habits.</p><p>In her statement, Columbia’s president reiterated that law enforcement agencies must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to gain access to non-public areas of the university, including housing, classrooms, and areas requiring key card access.</p><p>“All law enforcement agencies—including DHS and ICE—are obligated to follow established legal and ethical standards,” Shipman wrote in her letter following Aghayeva’s release. “And we expect those standards to be respected.”</p><h3>Columbia students targeted in federal immigration actions</h3><p>Aghayeva’s arrest comes nearly a year after Palestinian activist and Columbia student <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/us/mahmoud-khalil-ordered-released-by-judge?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mahmoud Khalil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mahmoud Khalil</a> was taken into ICE custody on March 8, 2025.

Adriano Espaillat, a former undocumented immigrant, said in a post<a href=\"https://x.com/repespaillat/status/2027060032995549665?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> on X</a> students and faculty “should not fear for their safety in their dorm rooms, the classroom, or anywhere else on campus,” and urged the university to bolster protections.</p><p>“This exhibit of the Trump Administration’s lawless actions — which are rarely supported by legitimate warrants or subpoenas — is yet another reminder that Columbia University and other institutions must enhance the protections and policies they utilize to create a safe environment for those they serve and employ,” Espaillat <a href=\"https://x.com/repespaillat/status/2027060032995549665?s=46\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote.</a></p><p>In a statement, Columbia University <a href=\"https://communications.news.columbia.edu/news/important-additional-updates-columbia-university\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">announced</a> it is taking additional steps to protect students and staff from similar incidents, with extra public safety patrols being deployed to residential buildings.</p><p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p><p>CNN’s Sara Smart, Taylor Galgano, Maria Santana and Katherine Koretski contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
