(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US and European markets mostly fell on Friday with tech stocks suffering,&nbsp;while oil prices jumped as a standoff between Iran and the United States deepened.</p><p>Wall Street&#39;s main indices fell at the start of trading,&nbsp;with tech stocks taking a hit.</p><p>An announcement by financial services firm Block that it would slash its workforce by nearly half and rely heavily on AI to operate more efficiently sparked fresh concerns about the disruptive nature of the technology.</p><p>&quot;Block won&#39;t be the last company making this type of announcement, which is what has the market spooked this morning about growth prospects,&quot; said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O&#39;Hare.</p><p>Stock markets soared to fresh heights last year thanks to investors piling into stocks of tech firms which are piling massive amounts of money into developing and deploying AI.</p><p>But the march higher hasn&#39;t been steady in recent months as concerns about AI disrupting industries occasionally triggers sudden drops in markets.</p><p>Investors have also been occasionally seized by concerns that the share prices of tech giants have risen too high and that AI may not be profitable.</p><p>Expectations of stellar performance have also worked against tech giants.</p><p>Nvidia&#39;s share price slumped 5.5 percent Thursday despite the chip giant announcing that its quarterly profits more than doubled to $43 billion.</p><p>It fell more than two percent as trading got under on Friday.</p><p>That was partly due to investors already having priced in an increase ahead of the announcement, but &quot;there are also concerns related to stretched valuations and Nvidia&#39;s dependence on capital spending by large technology companies investing in AI infrastructure,&quot; said City Index analyst Julian Pineda.</p><p>Trade Nation analyst David Morrison also pointed to investors shifting money from tech to other sectors.</p><p>He pointed out that the S&amp;P 500 is heading towards a 0.4 percent loss for the month of February, while the Dow is set for a 1.2 percent gain.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;This divergence provides further evidence of a clear rotation away from high-growth AI-linked names into more traditional cyclical sectors, even as broader macro risks tied to trade policy and geopolitical tensions linger in the background,&quot; he said.</p><p>Elsewhere on Friday, oil prices jumped more than three percent as Iran said that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its &quot;excessive demands&quot;, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war.</p><p>The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades.</p><p>Trump on February 19 gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran&#39;s missile programme, its ballistic missile capabilities, and its support for militant groups curtailed.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump&#39;s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States.</p><p>&quot;For oil prices, we have seen significant fluctuations as traders weigh up the likeliness of a conflict,&quot; said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.</p><p>- Key

Russian army, and either killed or captured on the battlefield.</p><p>Ghana&#39;s Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa travelled to Kyiv this week to discuss the fate of two Ghanaians taken prisoner on the frontline.</p><p>His Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy Sybiga, told him that more than 1,780 Africans from 36 countries were fighting Ukraine as part of Russia&#39;s forces.</p><p>Ablakwa said on Wednesday that his fellow countrymen were &quot;victims of manipulation, misinformation of criminal trafficking networks&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We were informed that 272 Ghanaians are believed to have been lured into battle since 2022 for which an estimated 55 have been killed and two captured as prisoners of war,&quot; he wrote on X.</p><p>&quot;As a responsible government, we cannot turn a blind eye to these heartbreaking statistics. These are not just numbers, they represent human lives, the hope of many Ghanaian families and our nation.&quot;</p><p>The foreign minister said the government was &quot;committed to tracking and dismantling all dark web illegal recruitment schemes operating within our jurisdiction&quot;.</p><p>&quot;This is not our war and we cannot allow our youth to become human shields for others,&quot; he added.</p><p>- &#39;Directly entangled&#39; -</p><p>The All Eyes on Wagner monitoring project said in early February that the recruitment of African nationals was &quot;the core of a deliberate and organised strategy&quot; by Russia to bolster its dwindling military ranks as the war drags on.</p><p>The biggest contingents come from Egypt (361 men) and Cameroon (335), then Ghana (234), the report said.

Labour Party, fighting to keep control of a seat in its historic heartland, and two outsiders – the hard-right populist Reform UK party, and the new-look progressive Green Party.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t even close.</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and member of the local council, won the seat in Gorton and Denton, near the English city of Manchester, with 14,890 votes, more than 40% of the total votes cast. Reform UK, which has led in most national polls for more than a year, came second with 10,578 votes, while Labour trailed in third, with 9,364 votes – around 25% of the total.</p><p>“I didn’t grow up wanting to be a politician. I’m a plumber,” Spencer said after the results were announced, apologizing to customers for having to cancel work now that she’s moving to Westminster. Spencer, who campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues, said she stood as a candidate after questioning the value of “hard work” in today’s Britain.</p><p>“Working hard used to get you something. It got you a house. A nice life. Holidays,” she said. “But now, working hard – what does that get you? Because talk to anyone here, and they will tell you. The people who work hard but can’t put food on the table. Can’t get their kids school uniforms. Can’t put the heating on… Life has changed.”</p><p>The result is an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is the Labour Party’s electoral backyard, made up of working-class voters, students and a large ethnic-minority population. Andrew Gwynne, the outgoing Labour MP who stood down due to health reasons, won the seat with more than 50% of the vote in the 2024 general election. Now, the Green Party has upended Starmer’s claim that only Labour can stop Reform from becoming the next government – an outcome that many experts have been predicting.</p><p>Spencer’s victory means the Greens now have five lawmakers in a parliament of 650, but more importantly marks the first time the Greens have won a by-election – a major boost to her party ahead of local elections in May, when voters will choose lawmakers for the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elect local council members in England. By-elections – votes held in individual seats between general elections – often have outsized significance, acting as a weathervane for national politics.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“The starting gun has fired on local elections in 70 days’ time,” Zack Polanski, the leader of the Greens, said at a victory rally early Friday morning. “This is an existential crisis for the Labour Party.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zh_QyrinEIKhRiHt_n4kjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/747c41eb43e331f7f6d0cf5eb88d4e57><noscript><img alt=\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zh_QyrinEIKhRiHt_n4kjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/747c41eb43e331f7f6d0cf5eb88d4e57 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Several recent Labour decisions have now been called into question. Among them is the party’s decision to target Reform UK – an upstart party led by Nigel Farage, the architect of Brexit and a friend of US President Donald Trump – as the “real opposition.” Despite winning just four seats at the last general election, Starmer decided early to elevate Reform to the status of Britain’s potential government-in-waiting, hoping that the prospect of Farage as prime minister would encourage voters to back Labour.</p><p>But the Greens’ victory means Labour is now fighting on two fronts. Having proclaimed Reform as the de facto opposition, Labour spent much of its first year in government trying to appeal to right-wing voters by hardening its rhetoric and policy on immigration.</p><p>Analysts questioned the wisdom of that strategy at the time. Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, told CNN that Labour seemed happy to risk upsetting progressive voters with its tougher stance on immigration, since those voters – faced with a choice between Labour and Reform – would ultimately “vote Labour to keep those bastards out.”</p><p>Now, that strategy may have backfired, as Labour realizes that chasing voters to its right has caused it to leak voters to its left.</p><p>“Our politicians have an absolutely appalling mental perception of what a northern voter looks like and thinks like,” Menon said. “This idea that everyone north of Watford is a total oik who’s basically a racist seems to be the common view now in our politics.”</p><p>Spencer’s victory casts doubt on that view. The Greens courted the constituency’s ethnic-minority voters, even publishing pre-election material in Urdu and Bangla. In her victory speech, Spencer criticized “divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society.”</p><p>Her remarks were a thinly -veiled attack on the Reform candidate Matt Goodwin, a former academic-turned-hard-right-activist, who had refused to disown his claim that people born in Britain from ethnic-minority backgrounds are not necessarily British. “It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British,’” Goodwin said during the campaign.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FMkHqqtQXxcsaKIYReIfZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/86c5623a7cd0ef5d55cf29e6e6a1599d><noscript><img alt=\"Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FMkHqqtQXxcsaKIYReIfZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/86c5623a7cd0ef5d55cf29e6e6a1599d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Farage said the result was a “victory for sectarian voting,” and a victory for “cheating in elections,” without providing evidence. Concerns were raised, however, by Democracy Volunteers, a group of independent election observers, about “extremely high” levels of family voting, in which a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else’s vote, for instance by entering a polling booth with them.</p><p>The result has also called into question Labour’s decision to block Andy Burnham, the hugely popular Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester who is seen as a potential leadership rival to Starmer, from standing in the election. Karl Turner, a Labour MP, told the BBC that he had “begged” Starmer not to block Burnham from standing in the election, saying he was “without a shadow of a doubt” that he would have won.</p><p>Labour’s decision to hold the by-election earlier than necessary now also appears to have backfired, since it will boost the Greens ahead of local elections on May 7. Labour MPs have previously told CNN that a disastrous set of results in those elections could prompt the party to oust Starmer as leader.</p><p>Starmer said the result was “very disappointing.” He pointed out that incumbent governments “often get results like that mid-term,” but stressed that he understands voters are “impatient for change.”</p><p>Polanski, whose leadership has re-energized the Green Party, looks set to profit off that impatience.</p><p>“Labour’s electoral stranglehold is over,” he told a crowd in Manchester. “This is a seismic victory. We have torn the roof off British politics. And that’s because people now recognize there is an alternative.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

in the desert of Niger, scientists have unearthed an unknown species of dinosaur, a giant fissvery of its kind in more than a century.</p><p>Around 95 million years ago, the Spinosaurus -- a massive beast with a blade-shaped head crest and interlocking teeth -- roamed the African continent.</p><p>Scientists believe it rivalled the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex in size, measuring around 40 feet long with a 20-inch sword-like crest on its head.</p><p>Researchers dug up fossils that belonged to the Spinosaurus mirabilis -- or &quot;hell heron&quot;, in the words of Paul Sereno, the University of Chicago palaeontologist and lead author of the research published in the journal Science.</p><p>&quot;Look at the length of the skull, the length of the neck, and the length of the hind limb -- you&#39;re in heron territory.&quot;</p><p>Spinosaurus mirabilis lived when forests and rivers covered the now-barren Sahara. Previously, most spinosaurid fossils had been found near coastlines in North Africa.</p><p>Some scientists thought these fish-eating creatures may have been fully aquatic, gliding through deep waters to snare prey.</p><p>But this time, the fossils were discovered further inland, hundreds of miles from what would have been the nearest ocean.</p><p>&quot;I think it was an animal that could have waded easily into the water,&quot; Sereno said.</p><p>&quot;But I do not think it was a diver, I do not think it was a good swimmer.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Earth-shattering site&#39; -</p><p>The search began in 2019 in the Sahara Desert, where French geologist Hugues Faure had said he found a tooth belonging to the giant predator Carcharodontosaurus in the 1950s.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve got a couple of things that Faure could never dream of. We have GPS coordinates, we have drones and better vehicles,&quot; said Sereno.</p><p>The barren sands yielded nothing and the team, disheartened, headed back to their camp.</p><p>But a Tuareg man in a black trench coat approached Sereno&#39;s team on a motorcycle, claiming to know where &quot;big bones&quot; lay.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>After a long journey through the desert, Sereno worried they &quot;had made a mistake&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We jokingly said, are we still in Niger? I mean, we drove for a day and a half until we had no more gas to spare because we wouldn&#39;t get back.&quot;</p><p>But eventually they reached a remote site where the &quot;biggest bones... I have ever seen in my life&quot; emerged from the ground.</p><p>Far out in the desert, the researchers gaped at the six-foot-long femur, the jaw, teeth, and base of the crest.</p><p>In 2022, Sereno returned with a 100-person team and 64 Nigerien guards to excavate the &quot;earth-shattering site&quot;.</p><p>They unearthed a skull, fragments of the hind legs and several crests.</p><p>&quot;The crest was like nothing we&#39;d ever seen before,&quot; said Sereno.</p><p>Some were brought to tears, he said, by the &quot;overwhelming&quot; experience.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s actually like looking at a digital image of your new dinosaur and gawking over it in the tent in the middle of the Sahara.&quot;</p><p>The team realised &quot;it was a new species... and it was going to be a landmark discovery.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s your Jurassic Park moment... one to remember for a lifetime.&quot;</p><p>cgc/bam/rh/rlp</p></div></article></div>",
