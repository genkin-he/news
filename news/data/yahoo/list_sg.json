Diego, California, U.S., November 7, 2025. - Mike Blake/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Transportation Security Administration workers will receive only a portion of their next paycheck, which they are set to receive as soon as Friday, according to a union official. The reduced pay comes as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/politics/department-homeland-security-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:partial government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">partial government shutdown</a> ends its second week with no resolution in sight.</p><p>The impasse could lead to staffing shortages and airport delays for some travelers, especially the longer TSA workers go without pay. (Air traffic controllers, however, are not affected by this partial shutdown.)</p><p>The agency is also making some changes to at least one trusted traveler program, temporarily halting the Global Entry program. Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/politics/shutdonw-tsa-precheck-global-entry-suspended-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program</a> but then reversed that decision.</p><p>However, many DHS workers will continue to be paid, despite the shutdown. Paychecks for sworn law enforcement officers in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Patrol and the US Secret Service, as well as for US Coast Guard military personnel, are being funded by the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” which President Donald Trump signed into law last summer, according to a senior administration official.</p><p>Other positions that work on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and border security priorities, such as technology specialists and attorneys, are also being paid through the president’s domestic policy package, the official said. The legislation provided the agency with a $165 billion infusion, which funneled $75 billion to ICE, alone, and $64 billion to CBP.</p><p>Other DHS employees throughout the agency are set to receive partial paychecks in coming days unless Congress acts. Most affected workers will only be paid for the second week of February in their next checks since the agency’s funding lapsed as of February 14.</p><p>These smaller paychecks will be the last many DHS employees receive until Congress comes to an agreement to fund the agency for part or all of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. The White House and Democrats have been negotiating reforms to the agency’s immigration enforcement operations after two US citizens were fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis in January. Senate Democrats are demanding changes before they’ll support appropriating more money for DHS.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Many TSA employees are already starting to struggle financially, concerned about how they’ll afford their March housing costs and day care, among other expenses, said Johnny Jones, secretary/treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees TSA Council 100, the union representing 46,000 uniformed TSA workers.</p><p>“You’re going to see TSA officers in food bank lines in a couple of days,” he said, adding that several colleagues have taken out payday loans.</p><p>In total, about 61,000 TSA employees must remain on the job at the nation’s more than 430 commercial airports during a shutdown. Many live paycheck to paycheck, Ha Nguyen McNeill, a senior official performing the duties of TSA administrator, said in written testimony for a House subcommittee hearing before the funding lapsed.</p><p>Overall, more than 90% of DHS’ 272,000 employees will continue working during a lapse, according to the agency’s September shutdown plan covering the first five days of an impasse. More than 93% of ICE and CBP workers will remain on the job.</p><p>Only about 44,500 staffers will continue to be paid through other appropriations, according to the shutdown plan.</p><p>During last fall’s shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/tsa-precheck-noem-dhs-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:DHS Secretary Kristi Noem;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">DHS Secretary Kristi Noem</a> said that 70,000 law enforcement personnel, including in CBP, ICE and other divisions, would receive their paychecks thanks to the funding from the “big, beautiful bill.”</p><p>DHS is using funds from the package to pay nearly 58,000 CBP employees, including officers and border patrol enforcement personnel, according to an email sent this week by the National Treasury Employees Union, obtained by CNN.</p><p>Federal employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends, according to a 2019 law.</p><p><em>This story has been update with additional details.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

any wrongdoing (HANDOUT)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former US president Bill Clinton denied wrongdoing Friday to a congressional panel probing his links to Jeffrey Epstein, as Democrats seek to shift focus onto Donald Trump&#39;s own ties to the notorious sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently in the Epstein files but insists that he broke ties well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>&quot;I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,&quot; Clinton said in his opening statement, shared on social media.</p><p>The Republican chair of the House committee probing Epstein, James Comer, said &quot;we believe this was a very productive deposition that President Clinton answered every question -- or attempted to answer every question.&quot;</p><p>Comer&#39;s Republican colleague Nancy Mace alleged there were &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in his testimony without providing specific examples.</p><p>Democrats on the committee have reiterated their call for Trump, who also has well-documented links to Epstein, to be quizzed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be real, we are talking to the wrong president,&quot; said Democrat committee member Suhas&nbsp;Subramanyam, who also emphasized that Clinton had not dodged any questions.</p><p>In his statement, Clinton did not name Trump directly but said &quot;no person is above the law, even presidents -- especially presidents.&quot;</p><p>As for Trump, he repeated his skepticism over the whole process, telling reporters he likes Clinton &quot;and I don&#39;t like seeing him deposed.&quot;</p><p>Being mentioned in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing and Clinton -- like Trump -- has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>Clinton follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday and defiantly called for Trump to appear before the panel.</p><p>The lawmakers should ask Trump &quot;directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors, with Bill Clinton likening the proceedings to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot; The couple has called for them to be open and televised.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Hillary Clinton said she had never known Epstein or visited the properties where he hosted world celebrities and powerful business and political figures -- as well as allegedly trafficking young women and girls.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein but said he never visited the financier&#39;s infamous private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14, but died in a New York jail cell in 2019 before he could be tried on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide but like much else around Epstein is the subject of lurid conspiracy theories.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- &#39;Turned him in&#39; -</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing Bill Clinton reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work.</p><p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein was in the White House 17 times while Bill Clinton was President. We know that Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane at least 27 times. So those are questions that we&#39;re going to ask,&quot; said Comer.</p><p>Clinton said in his opening statement &quot;not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing -- I would have turned him in.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, home to the Clintons, where dozens of journalists and Secret Service officers have converged.</p><p>pel-gw/sms</p></div></article></div>",

Iran for its history of imprisoning US citizens.</p><p>It is the first such designation under an <a

from illegally detaining US citizens and encourage them to release wrongful detainees they have in custody. The announcement from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio comes as the Trump administration is pressing for a new nuclear deal with Iran and has threatened to launch military action against the country.</p><p>“For decades, Iran has continued to cruelly detain innocent Americans, as well as citizens of other nations, to use as political leverage against other states. This abhorrent practice must end,” Rubio said in a statement.</p><p>Rubio warned that if Iran does not stop detaining Americans, “we will be forced to consider additional measures, including a potential geographic travel restriction on the use of U.S. passports to, through, or from Iran.”</p><p>There is such a travel restriction in place for North Korea. The US does not allow its citizens to travel to North Korea on US passports without an approved exception, and in those cases, the State Department issues a “special validation passport.”</p><p>“The Iranian regime must stop taking hostages and release all Americans unjustly detained in Iran, steps that could end this designation and associated actions. We encourage it to do so. No American should travel to Iran for any reason. We reiterate our call for Americans who are currently in Iran to leave immediately,” Rubio said Friday.</p><p>Iran has a history of wrongfully detaining Americans.

Valizadeh, an Iranian-American journalist, had worked in exile for Persian language outlets, including the US-funded Radio Farda. He returned to Iran in March 2024 to visit his elderly parents and was arrested in September of that year.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Concerns have mounted about his well-being in the years since his imprisonment.

No, I don’t think it will, unfortunately. But do I believe it’s helpful? Yes,” he told CNN.</p><p>Another American imprisoned in Iran is Kamran Hekmati, who was arrested last year and sentenced to prison time by Iranian authorities for visiting Israel more than a decade ago for his son’s bar mitzvah, according to family members who spoke to CNN.</p><p>The 70-year-old Hekmati is suffering from bladder cancer and is currently detained in Tehran’s notorious <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/23/world/iran-siamak-namazi-amanpour-interview?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Evin Prison;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Evin Prison</a>.

You can&#39;t just close the case,&quot; said Anton Berg, a ​co-presenter of the podcast, which intends to present the findings using AI gradually.</p><p>So far, Spår has announced no breakthrough in the case. But, pointing to the ability of AI tools to learn and improve, Berg said: &quot;Our hope is that this tool will get so advanced that we can open up the investigation again.&quot;</p><p>PARADIGM SHIFT</p><p>Palme was shot dead at close range on his way home from a visit to the cinema on February 28, 1986.</p><p>Over the years, the finger of blame has been pointed at South Africa&#39;s apartheid-era security services, Kurdish freedom fighters, right-wing extremists within the Swedish state and various lone ‌gunmen.</p><p>One man was convicted, but later freed, and prosecutors closed the ⁠case in 2020. A review last year confirmed the case would remain shut despite the main suspect being absolved.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t know any more than we knew on the day of the murder, essentially,&quot; said Gunnar Wall, who has written several books on the Palme killing.</p><p>On Saturday, the 40th anniversary ⁠of Palme&#39;s death, protesters will hand in a petition to parliament urging authorities to reopen the case. Such calls could get a boost if amateur sleuths are right in believing AI can now do what decades of police work failed to achieve.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The AI engine developed for the Spår crime podcast mimics a team of human investigators to probe evidence, evaluate findings and identify gaps, but can do so much more ​rapidly.</p><p>It ​can analyse the case&#39;s around 30,000 publicly available digital documents in less than a second. Otherwise the entire ​case files - about 500,000 pages - would take a decade just to read, ‌police say.</p><p>From fingerprinting to DNA profiling, forensic technology has reshaped criminal investigations. AI could be another game-changer, experts say.</p><p>In 2018, AI-assisted DNA analysis helped Los Angeles police catch Joseph DeAngelo, known as the Golden State Killer, who had murdered 13 people and raped at least 50 people many years earlier.</p><p>&quot;AI is a paradigm shift,&quot; said Lena Klasen, the former head of Sweden&#39;s National Forensic Centre and now Adjunct Professor in Digital Forensics at Linkoping University.</p><p>&quot;It is going to change how we work in the way that computers did. But this is bigger.&quot;</p><p>CAN AI PROVIDE ANSWERS?</p><p>Swedish police declined to say whether they had used AI in the Palme case, which will not be reopened unless there is good reason to believe that an investigation would lead to an arrest and ‌conviction.</p><p>Even with its data-crunching power, AI may struggle to find Palme&#39;s killer.</p><p>Case files are often heavily redacted and ​vast quantities of material is still unpublished, said Simon Lundell, part of a separate group of amateur investigators ​using AI in the hope of catching Palme&#39;s killer.</p><p>Gaining access to police files takes ​time, with only around 1,000 pages per year released. At this rate, it would take hundreds of years to be able to review all the ‌information.</p><p>Despite such problems, &quot;our goal is to solve the murder,&quot; Lundell said.</p><p>There is ​also no guarantee that the evidence needed to solve ​the Palme case even exists. Three public commissions concluded that police bungled the early investigation. Documents were lost and leads were not followed up.</p><p>&quot;There is no technique that can help with information that isn&#39;t there, and that is a big part of the problem that there are gaps in the information,&quot; said Lennart Gune, Director of Prosecution ​at the Swedish Prosecution Authority.</p><p>The use of AI in investigations also ‌comes with some concerns. The Golden State Killer case caused a fierce debate about privacy after millions of people had their DNA data scanned without their explicit ​consent.</p><p>In 2025, Sweden proposed a law that will allow police to use real-time, AI-powered face-recognition as a tool to fight gang crime, but its use will ​be limited over concerns about privacy and AI surveillance.</p><p>(Reporting by Simon Johnson, Editing by Timothy Heritage)</p></div></article></div>",

After all, she was not the one he had cheated on me with, and I felt no ill will toward her.</p><p>During her pregnancy, Wendy and I frequently bumped into each other in our small downtown. We’d greet each other and make small talk. In May 1985, her daughter was born. Because Wendy was new to our town when she met John, she didn’t know many people, so she asked if I would babysit for her on occasion.

Her emotions were raw as she told me about her husband’s recent health issues.

Her 6-Word Response Completely Broke Me.</a></strong></p><p>A few months later on a chilly winter evening, the three of us sat at a round table in a dimly lit restaurant. The small talk lasted for only a few minutes before we shared similar stories of our marriages to the same man. Being the first wife, I began. Then Wendy opened up. Then Suzy.</p><p>“I didn’t know he had been married <em>twice</em> before!” Suzy revealed. “I was standing in my soon-to-be mother-in-law’s kitchen, and I asked her if I should register for wedding gifts. She said, ‘Well, this is his third marriage.’ Of course, I knew about Wendy, but not you, Frances.”</p><p>As the restaurant began to close, we were still chatting, each of us amazed at the similar themes of betrayal and so many of the same lies that had been strung through each of our marriages. Hugging as we prepared to depart, we made plans for a “to be continued” get-together.</p><p>Never in a million years did I imagine I would be sitting at the same table with two of John’s ex-wives. Sharing our stories validated each of our experiences. It was clear his betrayals weren’t about us. Suzy had remarked, “At least he has good taste in women!” On that we all agreed.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 762px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:121%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy&#39;s daughter&#39;s baby shower.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ttOLNthFnbgSNSU0V1QoXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTAy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/93c91681af93a1ab9945cf209c973681><noscript><img alt=\"The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy&#39;s daughter&#39;s baby shower.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ttOLNthFnbgSNSU0V1QoXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTAy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/93c91681af93a1ab9945cf209c973681 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy's daughter's baby shower. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Frances Scott</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>It had been 30 years since my short marriage to John. During those years, he and I met for lunch a few times. I was always comfortable sitting across the table from him. I realized I had never been in love with him. At 21, I had been grabbing at the chance to save myself, especially after, as a teen, overhearing my father remark about a family friend, “I wonder what is wrong with Ann that she never married.” Ann seemed perfectly fine, but I didn’t want anything to be “wrong” with me. I thought getting married was the only way forward.</p><p>John never apologized for his infidelity, but I didn’t care. I didn’t need his apology.</p><p>Six months after our first gathering, Wendy, Suzy and I sat at Wendy’s dinner table. Our laughter filled the room when she suggested we call ourselves The Triple X’s (***) and that we should open a fine lingerie shop called ***. We made plans to gather again in a few months.</p><p>During our third meet-up, the subject of our ex-husband didn’t come up once. We had other things to talk about: books, music, our work and the going-ons in our community. Suzy asked, “Should we go out dancing next week? There is a good band playing downtown.”</p><p>Eventually we were no longer three women connected by the same ex — we were friends. It’s been 10 years since our first meal together. We now care for one another and enjoy spending time together. We’ve held each other up through hard times: Wendy’s second divorce, Suzy’s stressful job, my cancer. I lived with Wendy for a summer while in between residences. They have both trusted me for their house- and pet-sitting. The first time I dog-sat for Wendy, I felt right at home when I reached into the kitchen cabinet for a plate and found my everyday china from my marriage to John! I started writing this essay while dog-sitting for Suzy.</p><p>When Wendy and John’s daughter got married in 2016, she invited Suzy and me. We had each touched her daughter’s life, and she wanted us there at the beautiful outdoor setting along with her other fun-loving friends, as well as John, his new partner, our ex-mother-in-law and ex-brother-in-law.</p><p>I was excited and honored to be invited and had no concerns about seeing John, but Suzy was nervous. This would be her first time seeing him and his new partner, whom he had divorced Suzy to be with. Wendy and I reassured her we would be there for her. We told her that our mutual ex-husband would witness our connection and see three good choices that ended due to his bad choices.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 488px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:77%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Triple X&#39;s: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John&#39;s daughter in 2016.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1o1orzW.bK6aJ3gnjsuZlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/011a3f753fac4cdac100103ab0dfeb79><noscript><img alt=\"The Triple X&#39;s: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John&#39;s daughter in 2016.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1o1orzW.bK6aJ3gnjsuZlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/011a3f753fac4cdac100103ab0dfeb79 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The Triple X's: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John's daughter in 2016. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Frances Scott</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>On that sunny fall day, John, who, despite his infidelity, was always a good father, gave his daughter away. After the ceremony, the bride’s grandmother — my ex-mother-in-law — spotted me, grabbed me and insisted I find Wendy and Suzy for a photo.</p><p><span>Thirty-five years later, I was experiencing a redemption I never imagined: My ex-mother-in-law had sided with her son during our divorce, but now she was hugging me and asking how I was. She never verbally apologized for how she treated me all those years ago, but her actions were apology enough. </span></p><p><span>As Wendy, Suzy and I smiled into the camera, a piece of each of us was healed. Our ex-mother-in-law had recognized her son’s part in our failed marriages. If there was any bit of us that still felt inferior because of how we had been treated by John, it disappeared that day.</span></p><p><span>Since my marriage to John, I’ve been married two more times, and they both also ended in divorce. I’ve finally come into my own and no longer feel I need a man to be complete. Therapy helped me realize I was never actually afraid of being alone, I was afraid of “something being wrong with me” if I didn’t get married. But there isn’t — and there never was. </span></p><p><span>I love my autonomy and I love my life. Now, at 64, I know it’s my friendships that sustain me, and, really, they always have. I’m grateful for Wendy and Suzy and all that we’ve experienced together despite the unusual circumstances that brought us together, and I look forward to sharing many more years of fun and adventure and support with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Note: Some names and details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.</em></p><p><em>Frances Scott lives in Montana, where she writes essays and memoir.

The officer “asked multiple times for a warrant, which was not produced, and asked for time to call his boss, which was not given,” she said.</p><p>Shipman emphasized law enforcement officers must present a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the university, including residence halls, classrooms and buildings requiring Columbia University ID card access. An administrative warrant, she wrote, is not sufficient.</p><p>“All law enforcement agencies – including DHS and ICE – are obligated to follow established legal and ethical standards. And we expect those standards to be respected,” she said in a statement following Aghayeva’s release.</p><p>“This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,” she said.</p><h3>DHS claims her student visa was terminated</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7><noscript><img alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>DHS confirmed to CNN that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Aghayeva, “whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes.”</p><p>“The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.

identified her as one of several Columbia students targeted for immigration action under the Trump administration’s crackdown on international students involved in protests related to the Israel-Hamas

administration’s continued attack on universities and immigrants,” the American Civil Liberties Union in New York said in a statement to CNN.</p><h3>What can agents legally do?</h3><p>Without a warrant, federal agents can only enter campus areas of Columbia University that are open to the public such as outdoor walkways, according to CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson.</p><p>They have no legal right to enter residences or restricted university buildings without “specific legal authorization,” which would be a judicial warrant signed by an independent judge or magistrate but not an immigration official, Jackson said.</p><p>Immigration officials, he added, typically sign administrative warrants that may note immigration violations and authorize detention but “do not allow searches and seizures on private property.”</p><p>Columbia’s president has specified that an administrative warrant is “not sufficient” to access the university’s non-public areas, and that federal agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena.</p><p>Furthermore, tactics that include misrepresentation to gain access would be illegal and against the Constitution, said Jackson.</p><p>In the case of Aghayeva, it appears the law was “flagrantly violated,” which he says has parallels to the cases of 5-year-old <a

Carrillo)</figcaption></div></figure><p>NASA on Friday abruptly said it was shaking up its Artemis lunar program that has suffered multiple delays in recent years, a bid to ensure Americans can return to the Moon&#39;s surface by 2028.</p><p>That goal remains unchanged, but the US space agency is shifting its flight lineup to include a test mission before an eventual lunar landing to improve launch &quot;muscle memory,&quot; NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said.</p><p>That strategic revision comes amid repeated delays to the Artemis 2 mission, which was originally due to take off as early as February, but now will not launch before April.&nbsp;It is meant to see the first flyby of the Moon in more than half a century.</p><p>Earlier this week that mission faced another setback when NASA rolled back its towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft off the launchpad to investigate problems and make necessary repairs.</p><p>The announced changes mean that Artemis 3, which was meant to send astronauts to the Moon&#39;s surface, will now have the different test goal of &quot;rendezvous in low-Earth orbit&quot; of at least one lunar lander.</p><p>The next phase, Artemis 4, will aim for a lunar landing in early 2028. Isaacman said he hoped that mission could be followed relatively quickly by a second landing within the year.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re not necessarily committing to launching two missions in 2028,&quot; he told a briefing, &quot;but we want to have the opportunity to be able to do that.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Back to basics&#39; -</p><p>The announcement comes two days after NASA&#39;s independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual report that the Artemis 3 Moon landing plan carried &quot;significant risk&quot; including for the number of &quot;firsts&quot; it was attempting.</p><p>The NASA chief said Friday speeding up the cadence of Artemis launches would allow for building more institutional knowledge in the model of the Apollo program, which originally put Americans on the Moon.</p><p>&quot;Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, through the shuttle program -- I don&#39;t think it would surprise many of the folks in the room that our average launch cadence was closer to three months throughout all those programs, not three years,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to start getting back to basics and moving in this direction.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Launching every three years, your skills atrophy, you lose muscle memory.&quot;</p><p>Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Insistute, told AFP at first glance it seemed Isaacman was &quot;making some realistic and necessary decisions.&quot;</p><p>But Clayton Swope of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told AFP it left him with &quot;a lot of question marks,&quot; namely in terms of both the SLS rocket or the SpaceX landing system being ready according to NASA&#39;s timeline.</p><p>Still, with the revised architecture, &quot;you will potentially be buying down some risk that we would have carried all the way to the Moon had we gone straight to the Moon with the original plan,&quot; he said.</p><p>- &#39;Space race&#39;? -</p><p>During his first term President Donald Trump announced he wanted Americans to once again set foot on the lunar surface.</p><p>NASA hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with its own effort, which is targeting 2030 at the latest for a first crewed mission.</p><p>China&#39;s uncrewed Chang&#39;e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026 for an exploration of the Moon&#39;s south pole, and testing of its crewed spacecraft Mengzhou is also set to go ahead this year.</p><p>Queried on the so-called &quot;space race,&quot; Isaacman said Friday that &quot;I think competition is good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re here talking to you about what is a common-sense approach to achieve the objective, whether we had a great rival in the running or not.&quot;</p><p>But delays to space travel are not uncommon -- and could also stem from the progress of NASA&#39;s private partners.</p><p>SpaceX and Blue Origin, the respective space companies of dueling billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, are contracted to develop lunar landers used in the Artemis program.</p><p>Both companies posted praise of NASA&#39;s plans on social media Friday.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re all in!&quot; wrote Blue Origin on X, while SpaceX said it &quot;shares the same goal as NASA of returning to the Moon with a permanent presence as expeditiously and safely as possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Frequent human exploration flights help establish a sustainable presence for humans in space,&quot; SpaceX said.</p><p>mdo-cha/sms</p></div></article></div>",

Ford, approaching the coast of Israel, as he demands Iran agree to sweeping concessions on concerns starting with its nuclear program.</p><p>A day after the United States and Iran held talks in Geneva, Trump said that the cleric-run state was &quot;not willing to give us what we have to have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re not exactly happy with the way they negotiated. They cannot have nuclear weapons, and we&#39;re not thrilled with the way they&#39;re negotiating,&quot; Trump told reporters.</p><p>He later said he wants Iran to have &quot;no enrichment&quot; at all of uranium that could go toward a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies it is pursuing.</p><p>But Oman, which mediated the Geneva talks, offered a much rosier picture and said that Iran had agreed to zero stockpiling of any uranium, making moot the question of the level of enrichment.</p><p>Iran also agreed to degrade current stockpiles into fuel, said Oman&#39;s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, who was in Washington meeting US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>&quot;If the ultimate objective is to ensure forever that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb, I think we have cracked that problem through these negotiations by agreeing a very important breakthrough that has never been achieved any time before,&quot; Albusaidi told CBS News program &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</p><p>&quot;If we can capture that and build on it, I think a deal is within our reach,&quot; he said, estimating that three months would be needed to finalize an accord.</p><p>The renewed US pressure comes weeks after Iranian authorities killed thousands of people as they crushed mass protests.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>As Washington mobilizes forces, Trump said &quot;nobody knows&quot; if a US attack would bring down the Iranian government.</p><p>Iran agreed to restrictions to low-level enrichment in a 2015 deal that Trump ripped up during his first term in office.</p><p>Trump in June had said that Iran&#39;s key nuclear sites had been &quot;obliterated&quot; after the United States joined a major Israeli bombing campaign on the country.</p><p>- Rubio heads to Israel -</p><p>Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to Israel for talks on Iran on Monday, the State Department said.</p><p>In a rare break from decades of precedent, the top US diplomat will travel without reporters on his plane.</p><p>Rubio&#39;s trip comes as the US embassy announced it was allowing non-emergency government personnel and family members to leave Israel &quot;due to safety risks.&quot;</p><p>Germany in a new advisory said it &quot;urgently&quot; discouraged travel to Israel.</p><p>Britain said it was moving diplomatic staff out of Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s economic hub where most countries maintain embassies, to another location in the country as a &quot;precautionary measure.&quot;</p><p>China, a main partner of Tehran, called on its citizens to evacuate Iran &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;</p><p>- Issues beyond nuclear -</p><p>Trump in his State of the Union address Tuesday alleged Iran was developing missiles that could strike the United States.</p><p>Rubio later said it would be a &quot;very big problem&quot; for Iran if it does not discuss its missiles. Iran has insisted that the ongoing talks focus on the nuclear issue.</p><p>Increasing pressure, Rubio on Friday designated Iran a state sponsor of wrongful detentions, a new blacklist, over jailings of US citizens.</p><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday that &quot;success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands.&quot;</p><p>The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that it would hold technical discussions with Iran on Monday.</p><p>The agency called on Iran to cooperate with it &quot;constructively,&quot; according to a confidential report seen by AFP.</p><p>In their capital Tehran, ordinary Iranians expressed distrust of the United States and hoped negotiations would lead to economic relief for their sanctions-hit nation.</p><p>&quot;Whatever the outcome of the negotiations... it should lead to some improvement in people&#39;s economic situation. Not just a little -- it is our right,&quot; Ali Bagheri, 34, told AFP.</p><p>Hamid Beiranvand, 42, said Iran should &quot;not give any concessions&quot; as Washington &quot;breaks promises&quot; -- but that &quot;everyone prefers that a war doesn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p><p>burs-sct/nro</p></div></article></div>",
