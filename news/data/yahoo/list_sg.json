sidelines of an international summit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the sidelines of an international summit</a> in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.</p><p>The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.</p><p>Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.</p><p>“Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.</p><p>The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/11/business/rare-earth-minerals-trump-china-xi?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\"

for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.</p><p>In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.</p><p>Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.</p><p>China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.</p><p>One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.</p><p>On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.</p><p>The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.</p><p>“We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.</p><h3>Troubled trade</h3><p>The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.</p><p>At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.</p><p>Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.</p><p>Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.</p><p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”</p><p>Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.</p><p>Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.</p><p>But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.</p><p>Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.</p><p>The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.</p><p>CNN’s John Liu contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.</p><p>CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system. Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.</p><p>The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.</p><p>Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, where a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.</p><p>Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many account for 90% of the world’s arsenal, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide#toc-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"

nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.</p><p>When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”</p><p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”</p><p>The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.</p><h3>A new arms race?</h3><p>Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.</p><p>The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.</p><p>But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.</p><p>“If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.</p><p>Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.</p><p>When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.</p><p>“I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”</p><p>A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”</p><p>The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear

Kennedy couldn’t get a response from the child and came away from the encounter “shocked.”</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t just senators who heard from Kennedy about what he’d seen. His eldest daughter Kathleen vividly remembered the night he’d returned from Mississippi.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We had sat down to dinner in the dining room, with the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling, the table set with a linen tablecloth and china,” Kennedy told Larry Tie, author of a </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bobby-Kennedy-Making-Liberal-Icon/dp/0812983505\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:bestselling biography of Robert F.

I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation, you can tell from their faces, from their body movements and from their lack of social connection,” RFK Jr. said during a ceremony in Texas where Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ceremonially signed multiple pieces of MAHA legislation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>RFK Jr. is not a doctor, though even if he were one, it’s not clear if it would be possible to diagnose “mitochondrial challenges” by passing people on an airport concourse.</span></p><p><span>One of the new policies Abbott signed, a ban using SNAP benefits for sweetened drinks and candy, is set to take effect next April. Kennedy Jr. suggested the policy could help America return to better days: the time of his youth, when he didn’t know anyone with diabetes or autism, before his uncle and father were murdered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We have more chronic disease than any country in the world, and we know what it is, and we know it’s the food that we’re eating,” he said. “We’re doing something horrible to our children.”</span></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-federal-employees-forced-out_n_690240fce4b0f553c4350aff?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump’s Latest Milestone: Forcing 211,000 People Out Of Their Federal Jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump’s Latest Milestone: Forcing 211,000 People Out Of Their Federal Jobs</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-third-term-update_n_6901841fe4b0522875e88c4c?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;It&#39;s Pretty Clear&#39;: Trump Gives Surprise Update On 2028 &#39;Third Term&#39; Talk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">&#39;It&#39;s Pretty Clear&#39;: Trump Gives Surprise Update On 2028 &#39;Third Term&#39; Talk</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hasnt-been-necessary-more-than-national-guard_n_6901dbcbe4b0a85834080493?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Elaborates On His New Threat And Jabs At Reporter Who Asks About It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Elaborates On His New Threat And Jabs At Reporter Who Asks About It</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-food-stamps-soda-ban-maha_n_6901009ae4b09e9402366e84?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>From a deal to reduce tariffs slapped on China to planned cooperation on ending the war in Ukraine, here&#39;s what Beijing and Washington say was achieved during Donald Trump and Xi Jinping&#39;s first face-to-face talks in six years:</p><p>- Fentanyl -</p><p>The fentanyl trade has long been a sore point in relations between China and the United States: Washington accuses Beijing of turning a blind eye to the illegal trade in the drug, a charge it denies.</p><p>Trump hit China with a 20 percent levy on Chinese imports over complaints about its exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl.</p><p>However, he said after the talks in Busan the tariffs would be reduced to 10 percent -- bringing overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 percent.</p><p>Trump said Xi &quot;agreed that he was going to work very hard to stop the flow&quot; of the powerful opioid, which has killed thousands of Americans.</p><p>&quot;I believe he&#39;s going to work very hard to stop the death that&#39;s coming in,&quot; Trump told reporters on Air Force One.</p><p>- Hill of beans -</p><p>Beijing retaliated against Trump&#39;s fentanyl tariffs with levies against US agricultural products, including soybeans.</p><p>More than half of US soybean exports went to China last year, but Beijing halted all orders as the trade dispute deepened.</p><p>US farmers have been badly hit by the tariff war and are a key source of domestic political support for Trump.</p><p>Trump said China had now agreed to purchase &quot;tremendous&quot; amounts of soybeans, as well as other farm products.</p><p>&quot;That was a very nice gesture,&quot; he said of the talks that he described as a &quot;great meeting&quot;.</p><p>- Rare earths -</p><p>A strategic field dominated by China that is essential for manufacturing in defence, automobiles and consumer electronics, rare earths were expected to occupy a central role in the Busan talks.</p><p>Beijing imposed sweeping export controls on the materials and related technology this month.</p><p>Trump swiftly announced retaliatory tariffs of 100 percent on all Chinese goods, which were originally due to come into effect on Saturday.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But the US leader insisted on Thursday that &quot;that whole situation, that roadblock is gone now&quot;.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no roadblock at all on rare earths -- that will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary,&quot; he said, without giving details.</p><p>China&#39;s commerce ministry confirmed the restrictions on rare earths had been suspended &quot;for one year&quot;.</p><p>Washington in turn agreed to suspend for one year a move imposing &quot;Entity List&quot; export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies in which they had at least a 50 percent stake, a Chinese spokesperson said.</p><p>The United States also agreed to suspend for one year its Section 301 investigation into China&#39;s shipbuilding industry that led to both sides applying port fees against each other&#39;s ships, they said.</p><p>China would suspend its &quot;countermeasures&quot; after the US action, they added, also for one year.</p><p>- Ukraine -</p><p>Trump said the United States and China have also agreed to cooperate more on seeking an end to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>China says it is a neutral party in the conflict, but Kyiv and Western governments have long accused Beijing of providing political and economic support to Moscow.</p><p>Trump told reporters the subject had come up &quot;very strongly&quot; during his talks with Xi.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s going to help us, and we&#39;re going to work together on Ukraine,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>- Chips -</p><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>US chip giant Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Nvidia&#39;s chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;We did discuss chips,&quot; Trump said after meeting Xi, adding that Huang would speak to Beijing about the dispute.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re sort of the arbitrator or the referee,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>Huang is currently in Gyeongju, South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, which Xi is also expected to attend.</p><p>aue-oho-mya/je/hmn</p></div></article></div>",

announcement that previous negotiations had failed.</p><p>The talks come in the wake of the deadliest clashes between the South Asian neighbours since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.</p><p>More than 70 people were killed and hundreds wounded in violence that erupted after explosions in Kabul on October 9, which the Taliban authorities blamed on Pakistan.</p><p>The two sides had held days of talks in Istanbul, until Islamabad said Wednesday that the negotiations had collapsed.</p><p>&quot;On the request of the Afghan Taliban regime, another round of talks between Pakistan and Kabul is likely to take place in Istanbul,&quot; said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the subject publicly.</p><p>Pakistan state broadcaster PTV said Islamabad agreed to resume the talks at the request of the hosts.</p><p>Afghan state-run broadcaster RTA also reported Thursday that the &quot;stalled negotiations... are set to resume in Istanbul under the mediation of Turkey and Qatar&quot;.</p><p>RTA laid the blame for the talks&#39; collapse on &quot;unreasonable demands of the Pakistani side&quot;.</p><p>Afghan officials have not
