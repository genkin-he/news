CNN isn’t able to verify reports from the remote region where the fighting is taking place.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Taliban security personnel and residents search for victims after an overnight Pakistani airstrike hit a residential area at the Girdi Kas village in Bihsud district, Nangarhar province, on February 22, 2026. - AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CRBivLSjSnRnI0Vvz3Lt.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/7d0c624250c00952eccd9350f4f10c75><noscript><img alt=\"Taliban security personnel and residents search for victims after an overnight Pakistani airstrike hit a residential area at the Girdi Kas village in Bihsud district, Nangarhar province, on February 22, 2026. - AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CRBivLSjSnRnI0Vvz3Lt.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/7d0c624250c00952eccd9350f4f10c75 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Taliban security personnel and residents search for victims after an overnight Pakistani airstrike hit a residential area at the Girdi Kas village in Bihsud district, Nangarhar province, on February 22, 2026. - AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Pakistan’s information minister said militants from the Pakistani Taliban attempted to launch drones attacks in the northwest from within the country, which Pakistan’s anti-drone systems thwarted.</p><p>“The incidents have again exposed direct linkages between Afghan Taliban Regime and Terrorism in Pakistan,” Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said.</p><p>Tarar lambasted the Afghan Taliban as an “illegitimate regime,” in a later statement Friday, and claimed it “actively sponsors cross-border terrorism, institutionalizes slavery, and orchestrates the systematic erasure of women and minorities.”</p><p>Afghanistan’s Mujaid said on Friday: “We have always repeatedly emphasized a peaceful solution, and we still want to find a solution through dialogue.”</p><p>The US State Department expressed support for Pakistan’s “right to defend itself” against Taliban attacks, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Allison Hooker said in a social media post.</p><h3>Haven’t we been here before?</h3><p>Yes.

the US oil pipeline it protested, a North Dakota court ordered Friday.</p><p>The decision finalizes this phase of the explosive, yearslong case that has pitted the environmental organization against the company Energy Transfer, opening the door to an appeals process in the closely watched legal saga.</p><p>The Dallas-based energy conglomerate accused Greenpeace of orchestrating violence and defamation during the controversial construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline nearly a decade ago.</p><p>A jury last year took their side, awarding more than $660 million in damages across three Greenpeace entities, citing charges including trespass, nuisance, conspiracy and deprivation of property access.</p><p>Judge James Gion of North Dakota cut those damages in half, determining some damages had been counted twice.</p><p>But the sum remains staggering.</p><p>Greenpeace categorically rejects the accusations, denouncing the proceedings as abusive and a means to silence dissent.</p><p>Legal experts and advocacy groups alike have closely followed the case, given its potentially far-reaching implications for protest mobilization and advocacy movements.</p><p>Greenpeace has indicated its intention to appeal and has repeatedly stated it cannot pay hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>&quot;This legal fight is far from over,&quot; Kristin Casper, Greenpeace International general counsel, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>Marco Simons, another Greenpeace legal official, said &quot;speaking out against corporations that cause environmental harm should never be deemed unlawful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a setback, but the movement to defend people and the planet has always faced setbacks and resistance, and Energy Transfer will fail in its goal of silencing its critics.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer, meanwhile, has objected to the halving of its award.</p><p>Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School&#39;s climate change law center, told AFP the judgment was &quot;devastating.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;It is very bad not only for Greenpeace, but for the global environmental movement,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Global impact -</p><p>The case could have ripple effects worldwide.</p><p>When the initial verdict dropped last year, environmental defenders rallied around Greenpeace, denouncing the verdict as a chilling attack on climate action around the globe.</p><p>&quot;Fossil fuel companies invest billions in new oil and gas while they spread misinformation, lobby against climate policies, and attempt to silence dissent against their destructive business model,&quot; Allie Rosenbluth, the US campaign manager of Oil Change International, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>&quot;They must not be allowed to act with impunity.&quot;</p><p>At the heart of the North Dakota court battle was the Dakota Access Pipeline, where from 2016 to 2017 the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil-fuel protests in US history.</p><p>The demonstrations saw hundreds arrested and injured, drawing the attention of the United Nations, which raised concerns over potential violations of Indigenous sovereignty.</p><p>Despite the protests, the pipeline -- designed to transport fracked crude oil to refineries and on to global markets -- became operational in 2017.</p><p>Energy Transfer, however, continued its legal pursuit of Greenpeace.</p><p>After its federal lawsuit was dismissed, it shifted its legal strategy to the state courts in North Dakota, one of the minority of US states without protections against so-called &quot;Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation&quot; or SLAPPs.</p><p>Throughout the yearslong legal fight, Energy Transfer&#39;s billionaire CEO Kelcy Warren, a major donor to President Donald Trump, was open about his motivations.</p><p>His &quot;primary objective&quot; in suing Greenpeace, he said in interviews, was not just financial compensation but to &quot;send a message.&quot;</p><p>Warren went so far as to say that activists &quot;should be removed from the gene pool.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to AFP&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>Greenpeace maintains that it played only a small and peaceful role in the movement, which was led by Native Americans.</p><p>Greenpeace International in 2025 announced plans to counter-sue Energy Transfer in the Netherlands, where the NGO&#39;s international headquarters are, accusing the company of using nuisance lawsuits to suppress dissent.</p><p>It is seeking compensation for the costs incurred in these legal battles.</p><p>cha-mdo/nro</p></div></article></div>",

State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 24, 2026. - Nathan Howard/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>When President Donald Trump visited Fort Bragg, North Carolina, earlier this month, the commander of the elite Army Delta Force responsible for carrying out the operation to seize Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro made clear there was one man in particular who deserved the highest military honor: Chief Warrant Officer 5 Eric Slover.</p><p>Slover, an Army special operations pilot, was guiding his MH-47 helicopter to a landing in Caracas when the aircraft was “immediately” fired upon by multiple machine guns at close range, according to the citation that would eventually accompany that honor. The cockpit was hit by 15 armor-piercing rounds, four of which hit Slover in the leg.</p><p>Slover maintained control of the helicopter to ensure the safety of the Special Forces soldiers on board as they exited the aircraft to complete the mission.</p><p>The commander told Trump that Slover should receive the Medal of Honor for his actions, according to an official familiar with the matter. Trump was quickly convinced and signaled to the team he was going to do just that, two senior White House officials told CNN.</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Slover, who sustained serious injuries during the operation, stood stoically during the State of the Union address as the recognizable light blue ribbon of the Medal of Honor was secured around his neck, the medal gently placed in the center of the tie on his dress uniform.</p><p>The speed at which the Medal of Honor was approved is highly unusual. Approval for the award can take years due to the intensely bureaucratic process for consideration. There is also sometimes dispute about whether or not to award the medal, a senior White House official said, and in this case, “the president made the decision and the entire team worked together to execute.”</p><p>The award was expedited at the direction of Trump, who was eager to make the announcement at the State of the Union — an address his team had carefully crafted to include inspiring stories to engage the audience, the officials said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Two sources familiar with the situation said that all official paperwork and processes were followed for Slover’s medal, but at a much faster timeline, helped along by military leaders’ willingness to support it and make the recommendations in-person. One of the sources acknowledged the process was “blazing fast” but said verbal approvals and briefings pushed things along as the paperwork caught up. An Army spokesperson said Friday that the service is “incredibly proud” of Slover and also said that “all statutory requirements” for the award were followed.</p><p>A Trump official tasked with expediting the process for Slover worked furiously in the days following the president’s visit to Fort Bragg to rush the paperwork through, the senior White House officials said. The camera-ready moment in which Trump called for the medal to be given to Slover was written into the first draft of his speech, one of the officials said. However, it wasn’t clear until Tuesday, the day Trump was delivering his address, whether the White House could complete the process in time.</p><p>“The White House and the Pentagon were proud to work expeditiously at the President’s direction to ensure this great American hero received the award he most certainly deserves,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN.</p><p>Still, Slover had to agree to be featured in such a public event. The physical toll of the operation to seize Maduro has been significant; Trump said during the address that Slover was hit “very badly in the leg and hip” by armor-piercing rounds that “shred(ded) his leg.” While Slover stood tall while he was being honored, when Trump’s speech began moving on, Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, commander of Joint Special Operations Command, appeared to lean forward and help Slover sit back into a wheelchair sitting behind him.</p><p>The second source familiar with the situation said that his physical recovery pending, Slover wants to continue his career as an operational pilot, though it’s unclear if that will be possible, both physically and as those working with special operations typically take great lengths to avoid being publicly recognized. That calculus undoubtedly weighed on him as a soldier who has spent his career in the shadows, engaged in covert operations, but who was suddenly thrust under a national spotlight.</p><p>Slover is “incredibly humble and stoic,” the second source familiar said, and someone who “has never and would never have the expectation of getting this medal for his actions.” The fanfare, they said, is not something he has sought or, frankly, enjoys.</p><p>“In his eyes this is what he signed up to do,” the source said. “He’s honored to have received this, but this is just what he would have done whether there was a medal at the end or not.”</p><p>There have been discussions about holding another more private ceremony with Trump and Slover’s family and friends, who traditionally participate in events when a Medal of Honor is awarded, the second source familiar with the situation said. Trump also said Tuesday that 10 other soldiers from the mission will receive awards, though it’s unclear what those will be or when that ceremony would be held.</p><p>The White House is holding a Medal of Honor ceremony on Monday honoring service members from several conflicts, though the listed recipients do not include service members who participated in the recent Venezuela operation.</p><p>While details of Slover’s service are scarce, likely given the sensitive nature of the units he has been assigned to and his deployments, the awards he has received paint a picture of a challenging career.</p><p>Slover enlisted in the Army in 2005, and attended Warrant Officer Candidate School and flight school, becoming a Chinook pilot. Army warrant officers are considered the ultimate experts in their craft, and it’s rare for a soldier to make it to the rank of CW5 as Slover has; only three to four percent of warrant officers rise to that level, the Army <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/263117/afc_warrant_officer_achieves_cw5_rank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said in 2023</a>.</p><p>A list of his awards provided by Army Special Operations Command shows that he has received two Distinguished Flying Crosses — one with a valor device and one without — a highly prestigious medal given to service members for heroism in an aerial fight. The “V” for valor device denotes acts of heroism “above what is normally expected,” according to the medal’s criteria, “while engaged in direct combat with an enemy of the United States.”</p><p>Slover has also received the Bronze Star with one oak leaf cluster, a Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and more.</p><p>On January 3, he was flying an MH-47 — the Special Operations variant of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter — during the operation in Venezuela, dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve. According to <a href=\"https://www.cmohs.org/recipients/eric-a-slover\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the official citation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the official citation</a> for his Medal of Honor, Slover “skillfully led the helicopter through a dense jungle valley in a mountainous region” and “near insurmountable surface to air threats.”</p><p>Trump, telling the story of Slover’s heroism at the State of the Union, said that after landing the helicopter safely, Slover told his co-pilot who was also wounded to take over, saying, “I’m about to pass out.”</p><p>“Chief Warrant Officer Five Slover’s heroic actions undoubtedly saved countless America lives and ensured the complete and overwhelming success of the mission,” the citation says. “His gallantry under fire and extraordinary valor are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.”</p><p>The recommendation process for the Medal of Honor, according to flow charts on <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/steps.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:an Army website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">an Army website</a> outlining the details, involve reviews of the valorous action by the service member’s chain of command, a decorations board which determines if the Medal of Honor is warranted or not, consultation with the service chief and service secretary, and finally sending the packet up to the Secretary of Defense who can recommend the award to the president. The president has to give final approval to award the Medal of Honor.</p><p>As the process was expedited with the leaders’ recommendation being taken straight to the president, in person, Slover still had to agree to participate in such a public moment. The second source familiar with the situation said he agreed after speaking with other leaders about it, roughly a week before the State of the Union.</p><p>Every element came together, and on Tuesday evening in the Capitol, Slover stood with the help of a walker and stared straight ahead as Braga, commander of Joint Special Operations Command, placed the nation’s highest medal for military valor around his neck.</p><p>As the crowd applauded and chanted “USA!” Slover nodded and thanked those around him, showing little emotion aside from a brief moment with his wife, when he smiled down at her and squeezed her hand.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Then there’s the fact that Kansas is one of the 36 states that require photo IDs to vote, potentially creating</span><span>&nbsp;new barriers to voting in the months before the upcoming midterm elections.</span></p><p><span>“This law is unnecessary and dangerous. When it comes to identification documents, transgender people use them for the same reasons as anyone else – IDs allow us the freedom to travel, work, and drive. And just like everyone else, our IDs need to match who we are so that we can simply move through our lives without issue,” Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the senior vice president of public engagement campaigns at the Trevor Project, a national LGBTQ+ youth support organization, said in a statement to HuffPost.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-military-drone-attack-reaction_n_69a11411e4b0788617056b5a?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Staggering&#39; Incompetence: Critics Rip Trump Admin After U.S. Shoots Down Its Own Drone;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">&#39;Staggering&#39; Incompetence: Critics Rip Trump Admin After U.S. Shoots Down Its Own Drone</a></strong></p><p><span>“This law is meant to cause fear and confusion, but I want every transgender person in Kansas to know that there is a coalition of leaders, legal experts, and advocates fighting back.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kansas’ first-of-its-kind law represents the culmination of years of conservative lawmakers attacking transgender people and working to erase them from public life. “SB 244 is a sweeping law that has the goal of pushing transgender people out of civil society by making it impossible for them to be themselves in public spaces,” said Seldin.

The new measure can also be enforced by the general public, as it allows individuals to sue for alleged violations.</span></p><p><span>“The point of these laws is to make it impossible for trans people to be themselves and to know what to do to keep themselves safe,” Seldin added.</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gavin-newsom-slams-fox-news-criticism-sat-comments-trump-offensive-remarks_n_69a07c5ee4b059e1adf27971?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Gavin Newsom Obliterates Fox News For ‘Weaponizing’ His SAT Comments While Ignoring Trump’s Offensive Remarks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Gavin Newsom Obliterates Fox News For ‘Weaponizing’ His SAT Comments While Ignoring Trump’s Offensive Remarks</a></strong></p><p><span>The Republican Party is currently in the grip of a faux moral panic about trans people.
