26, 2026. - George Walker IV/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Nine months after Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national who was illegally deported by the Trump administration, became a defendant in one of the government’s marquee criminal cases, prosecutors are on the defensive in court as they try to convince a federal judge that the case wasn’t vindictively pursued.</p><p>The high-stakes hearing at a federal court in Nashville is the latest flashpoint in a sprawling web of court cases Abrego Garcia has found himself in since his hasty deportation last March to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador and the administration’s initial reluctance to bring him back came to symbolize President Donald Trump’s slapdash and contentious approach to immigration enforcement.</p><p>That the proceeding before US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw is happening at all is a remarkable turn of events in a criminal case that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373969491112\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:once described as “strong.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">once described as “strong.”</a> The department has for months tried to avoid being put in the awkward position of having to defend its prosecution of Abrego Garcia but amid the legal wrangling, it’s been forced to turn over some internal communications that further undermined the case.</p><p>Three officials, including Robert McGuire, a top-ranking federal prosecutor who secured the pair of human smuggling charges last year, will answer questions under oath on Thursday about the government’s decision making in the run-up to Abrego Garcia’s indictment.</p><p>Also in the hot seat are two agents from the Department of Homeland Security’s investigatory arm, who are set to testify about the agency’s decision to reopen a criminal probe into Abrego Garcia last year after several courts – including the Supreme Court – ordered the government to work to bring him back from El Salvador.</p><p>The integrity of the case has come under serious doubt by Crenshaw in recent months as he’s assessed Abrego Garcia’s claim that he’s being prosecuted in retaliation for successfully challenging his wrongful deportation, concluding that the Maryland father of three has shown evidence of a “realistic likelihood” that he’s the target of a vindictive prosecution. That conclusion could lead him to soon throw out the case – unless the trio of witnesses can convince him otherwise.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Requests by criminal defendants for judges to toss out charges based on their claim that they’re being vindictively prosecuted face extremely high hurdles in court and are overwhelmingly unsuccessful because of how difficult it can be to connect prosecutors’ decisions to a retaliatory motive.</p><p>But a pair of blockbuster rulings by Crenshaw last year revealed the shaky ground the case was on. The appointee of former President Barack Obama said that the burden was now on the government to fend off a presumption that officials only reopened a years-old probe into Abrego Garcia, and subsequently asked a grand jury to approve charges, to punish him for filing a lawsuit over his deportation.</p><p>“The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego’s success in the Maryland lawsuit and deterring any future efforts in that lawsuit,” Crenshaw wrote in the first ruling, issued in October.</p><p>In that decision, the judge carefully laid out key moments leading up to Abrego Garcia’s indictment that appeared to support his claim that officials only reopened their investigation into him in response to his winning streak in the deportation case. He specifically called out public statements made by Blanche on the day Abrego Garcia was arrested that “directly linked the Maryland lawsuit to the investigation of criminal behavior by Abrego.”</p><p>“At minimum, this suggests the (administration’s) frustration with Abrego, and that his case was not a run-of-the-mill prosecution,” he wrote. “Even assuming the individual motive of Acting US Attorney McGuire was pure, others’ motives, like fruit from a poisonous tree, may taint this prosecution.”</p><p>In a ruling issued in December, Crenshaw brushed aside claims by McGuire that he was the sole decision maker as his office weighed charges against Abrego Garcia, with the judge saying instead that a trove of internal documents “suggest” the prosecutor worked with department officials in Washington, DC, “who may or may not have acted with an improper motivation.”</p><p>Among those officials is Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche and communicated directly with McGuire last spring about the investigation into Abrego Garcia as the US Attorney’s Office in Nashville was considering bringing a case.</p><p>That neither Singh nor Blanche are testifying at the hearing could prove consequential since the judge has already signaled dissatisfaction with the representations made by McGuire about the charging decisions.</p><p>But if Crenshaw decides that the testimony provided Thursday is enough to refute his preliminary finding from last year, it’ll set up another round of court proceedings in which he’ll have to resolve a request from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers for him to summon Blanche and Singh to Nashville to testify at yet another hearing.</p><p>McGuire, who now serves as an assistant US attorney in the office he once temporarily helmed, has previously argued that even if others in the administration “have alleged ill will” toward Abrego Garcia, “there is nothing before the court to establish that such alleged ill will actually motivated the prosecution.”</p><p>He said in a sworn statement last September that he “never received any direction” from officials at DOJ headquarters “that was unethical or inappropriate” and that choosing to charge Abrego Garcia “was the correct legal decision.” Those assertions and others will be under the microscope Thursday as he takes the witness stand.</p><h3>Rare hearing</h3><p>Legal experts said that Crenshaw’s earlier rulings have put the government on notice that the case is quickly unraveling.</p><p>“It is exceedingly rare that, as here, the evidence triggers the presumption of a vindictive prosecution that the government must rebut. This puts the government’s counsel on their heels,” said retired federal Judge John Jones.</p><p>“The government’s witnesses are going to have to try to explain away a determination to prosecute Abrego Garcia that came from Main Justice and only after he was released,” Jones added. “From the defense’s standpoint, this is a lawyer’s dream.”</p><p>Abrego Garcia has been on pre-trial release in Maryland and is simultaneously fighting off efforts by the administration to re-deport him, this time to a country other than El Salvador.</p><p>His initial deportation to that country, which he is from, violated a 2019 court order that expressly prohibited officials from sending him back there because he feared gang violence there.</p><p>After a federal judge in Maryland said the government needed to work to “facilitate” his return, officials resisted complying with her order for months, but eventually partnered with El Salvador to return him in early June. He was arrested on the human smuggling charges when he returned to American soil.</p><p>Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the pair of charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop that was the subject of a federal investigation that closed days before he was deported last March.</p><p>Prosecutors elected to not bring charges following the stop, but in the indictment secured last year, they alleged that the nine Hispanic male passengers who were in the car with Abrego Garcia were being smuggled as part of a yearslong international smuggling ring that he was involved in.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

double trade to offset the damage of his country&#39;s fracturing relations with the United States.</p><p>Carney&#39;s India visit marks the latest effort to reset bilateral ties that effectively collapsed after Ottawa accused New Delhi of orchestrating a deadly campaign against Sikh activists on Canadian territory.</p><p>For Carney, the trip that includes stops in Australia and Japan is part of a broad effort to pivot the Canadian economy away from excessive reliance on its southern neighbor.</p><p>In 2024, before US President Donald Trump returned to office and upended global trade through a flurry of tariffs, more than 75 percent of Canadian exports went to the United States. Two-way trade that year exceeded $900 billion.</p><p>So far Trump broadly adhered to the North American free trade agreement he signed during his first term and about 85 percent of US-Canada trade remains tariff-free.</p><p>But at the same time, he also imposed painful industry-specific tariffs and there are fears that if he scraps the broader trade deal, the Canadian economy will be hit hard.</p><p>Carney has made boosting commerce with Europe and Asia cornerstones of his strategy to backstop Canada&#39;s economy, should free trade with Washington collapse.</p><p>University of Toronto public policy expert Drew Fagan said Carney was wise to pursue other markets, calling for a strategy that seeks to do &quot;more elsewhere, when there&#39;s an opportunity.&quot;</p><p>The prime minister has said he wants to more than double two-way trade with India by 2030, eyeing a target of Can$70 billion ($51 billion) by 2030.</p><p>Fagan cautioned that progress with countries like India cannot mitigate the damage of a US rupture.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not a solution. It&#39;s not a replacement and it never will be,&quot; Fagan told AFP.</p><p>- Transnational repression -</p><p>Carney left Ottawa on Thursday morning en route to Mumbai.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He is expected to meet with business groups in the Indian city over the weekend before heading to New Delhi for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a meeting that will be closely watched.</p><p>Before Carney took office last year, Ottawa accused Modi&#39;s government of direct involvement in the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a naturalized Canadian citizen who advocated for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.</p><p>Former prime minister Justin Trudeau&#39;s government further charged India with directing a campaign of intimidation against Sikh activists across Canada.</p><p>India has denied those allegations.</p><p>Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand was asked Monday if Canadian concerns about transnational repression would feature at the New Delhi talks.</p><p>&quot;Yes, that is always at the forefront of our minds,&quot; Anand told reporters in Ottawa.</p><p>Carney&#39;s hopes for trade growth with Australia and Japan are more modest, but his office said cooperation over critical mineral supply chains will be a priority.</p><p>Advanced economies have made a push to deepen critical mineral cooperation, especially in the processing of rare earth elements essential to power many high-tech products.</p><p>China currently has dominant control of rare earth supply chains, a concern that Canada highlighted throughout its just-concluded G7 presidency.</p><p>bs/aha/md</p></div></article></div>",

Syria last month following the sudden withdrawal of Kurdish forces, witnesses have told AFP.</p><p>An AFP journalist who entered the huge Al-Hol camp on Wednesday found it virtually deserted after the Syrian government decided to evacuate the site.</p><p>Until recently, it housed 23,500 people and was the largest camp for relatives of suspected IS jihadists in northeastern Syria.</p><p>Since the territorial defeat of IS, it had been under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.</p><p>However the SDF swiftly left the camp on January 20, under pressure from Syrian troops which were seizing swathes of the country&#39;s north months after their ouster of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Syrian security forces say they took over control six hours later.</p><p>Thousands of family members of suspected jihadists left for parts unknown.</p><p>As soon as the Kurdish forces left, &quot;it was utter chaos,&quot; Salah Mahmud al-Hafez, who lives in the nearby Al-Hol village, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;The SDF withdrew, and the locals and tribesmen came,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Cars loaded people and drove off,&quot; Hafez said, adding that the camp &quot;remained without security control&nbsp;for three hours.&quot;</p><p>- Toys, food left behind -</p><p>The camp held mostly women and children, the majority of them Syrian or Iraqi.</p><p>However a high-security annex housed more than 6,000 foreigners of around 40 nationalities.</p><p>Access to the camp remains prohibited and checkpoints have been set up on the road leading to it, according to the AFP journalist at the scene.</p><p>The paths of the empty camp are now strewn with rubbish bags, and white tents stretch as far as the eye can see.</p><p>Children&#39;s toys and tricycles have been abandoned in the foreigners&#39; annex.</p><p>Clothes, notebooks and even food were left behind, signs of a hasty departure.</p><p>Last week, Syrian authorities evacuated the remaining families at the camp after determining that the conditions at Al-Hol -- particularly security -- were inadequate.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Syria&#39;s interior ministry confirmed on Wednesday there were mass escapes from the camp, accusing the Kurdish SDF of withdrawing &quot;suddenly, without coordination and without informing&quot; them.</p><p>The SDF responded by saying their withdrawal was &quot;a direct result of the military attack... targeting the camp and its surroundings by forces affiliated with Damascus&quot;.</p><p>The SDF also said the families escaped after Syrian troops took control of the camp.</p><p>Local resident Hafez said that &quot;when the state took over, it gave the people the choice to stay or leave.&quot;</p><p>Morhaf Al-Olayan, a 43-year-old farmer who lives next to the camp, said that after the Kurdish forces departed, &quot;cars came, loaded the families, and left&quot;.</p><p>The father of five said he saw men &quot;wearing camouflage military uniforms&quot; among those transporting the families.</p><p>Farhan Abbas, an 86-year-old who lives near the camp, said that &quot;people fled... in all directions&quot;.</p><p>The detained family members had not been charged with any crime, but many had embraced the idea of living in the Islamic State&#39;s self-declared caliphate.</p><p>- Women and children at risk -</p><p>The foreigners&#39; annex held a large number of people from around the world, including Russia, the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p><p>While the whereabouts of those who left the camp remain unknown, teachers in the former rebel stronghold of Idlib in northwestern Syria told AFP that several children from Uzbekistan have enrolled in their schools since late January.</p><p>In a report earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said that most of Al-Hol&#39;s residents &quot;left in a largely unplanned and chaotic manner&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The way these departures have unfolded has exposed women and children to serious risks, including trafficking, exploitation, and recruitment by armed groups,&quot; the report warned.</p><p>Kurdish forces still control the smaller Roj camp in Syria&#39;s northeast, where more relatives of suspected foreign jihadists including Westerners are detained.</p><p>The Kurds had repeatedly urged countries to take back their citizens but few did, fearing security threats and a domestic political backlash.</p><p>&quot;For years, many governments claimed that difficulties negotiating with a non-state actor in charge of the camps was why they couldn&#39;t repatriate their citizens, but now that excuse won&#39;t hold,&quot;&nbsp;Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in the report.</p><p>For the jihadists themselves, the United States military has transferred more than 5,700 IS suspects from Syrian prisons to Iraq.</p><p>str-lk/nad/dl/ser</p></div></article></div>",

Assessing property tax for owner-occupied properties based on capital value would not be an appropriate approach, said second minister for finance Indranee Rajah during the debate on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) budget on Feb 26.</p><p>“One should adopt the same valuation basis for all residential properties, regardless of whether it is owner-occupied, rented out or vacant,” she said.</p><p>“That is so that there is a common yardstick to assess properties for property tax purposes.”</p><p>Ms Indranee was responding to WP MP Kenneth Tiong (Aljunied GRC) who proposed that the valuation of an owner-occupied residential property for property tax purposes should be derived differently from a non owner-occupied property.</p><p>Mr Tiong raised the possibility of a cut on property tax valuations.</p><p>He also suggested that the valuation for rented properties should be based on annual value (AV), which reflects rental transactions, while owner-occupied properties should instead be based on capital value.</p><p>Capital value represents the total current market worth of a property if sold, whereas AV is the estimated gross yearly rental income a property can generate.</p><p>Ms Indranee said that the use of rental data to determine AV keeps property taxes, which are assessed annually, more stable and predictable for homeowners.</p><p>She noted there are more rental transactions than sale transactions, which provides a more accurate and stable picture of comparable properties to determine the valuation of a given property.</p><p>Rents are also generally less volatile and subject to less variability compared to sale prices, as the rents are locked in by the lease agreements over a period of time, and hence they are less impacted by market sentiments and the property cycle, she said.</p><p>“Just because a neighbour may have a better or a more nicely developed home that commands a higher rental or AV, doesn’t mean that the neighbour who has a simpler home will have the same AV, because obviously, when valuing, adjustments will have to be made to take into account the necessary attributes.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>However, there are different property tax rates for owner-occupied and non owner-occupied properties as a concession to owner-occupied properties, she noted. Property tax rates for owner-occupied properties are lower compared to non owner-occupied properties.</p><p>The Government, from time to time, provides one-off property tax rebates for owner-occupied properties to help cushion the impact of the property tax, she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, shifting to capital value as the basis for property tax assessment doesn’t necessarily lower the assessment.</p><p>When a neighbourhood is revitalised, property values typically rise, leading to higher rents and sale prices or higher AV and capital value, she added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/using-capital-value-to-assess-property-tax-for-owner-occupied-homes-not-an-appropriate-approach?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Kaufman says the 80-year-old is not mentally fit to follow the hearing.</p><p>The lack of evidence of a &quot;causal nexus&quot; between Duterte&#39;s words and alleged crimes &quot;should be sufficient to convince any reasonable bystander... that Rodrigo Duterte is innocent of these charges levelled at him&quot;, said Kaufman.</p><p>Earlier in the week, the prosecution laid out their case: that Duterte played a &quot;pivotal&quot; role in a campaign of extrajudicial killings that saw thousands murdered.</p><p>Duterte personally drew up death lists, incited murders and then boasted about them afterwards, prosecutors alleged.</p><p>They showed multiple videos of the former president threatening to murder alleged drug users and joking about his skills in extrajudicial killing.</p><p>But Kaufman said the prosecution had &quot;cherry picked&quot; speeches, ignoring what he said were dozens of examples of Duterte stressing the need to act within the law.</p><p>&quot;Do not kill if you are not in danger of losing your life,&quot; Kaufman cited Duterte as saying in one speech.</p><p>- &#39;Hearsay&#39; -</p><p>Kaufman also attacked the credibility of the witnesses the prosecution relied upon for its charges against Duterte -- sometimes the direct killers themselves.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The prosecution witnesses are &quot;inherently unreliable because (they are) self-confessed vicious murderers testifying in return for virtual immunity from proceedings at the ICC&quot;, said Kaufman.</p><p>He said there was &quot;something morally repugnant or even questionable from a public policy standpoint to shield not only one but a number of murderers from prosecution at the ICC just in an attempt to nail Rodrigo Duterte&quot;.</p><p>The defence lawyer also alleged that the statements of the witnesses contradicted each other in many key aspects.</p><p>He dismissed statements from prosecution witnesses as &quot;assumption layered upon hearsay&quot; and urged the judging panel to give them &quot;negligible evidentiary weight&quot;.</p><p>Following the week-long &quot;confirmation of charges&quot; hearing, the three-judge panel has 60 days to decide whether to proceed to a full trial.</p><p>A lawyer representing the victims told the ICC on Tuesday that the court was the &quot;last refuge&quot; for loved ones in their search for justice.</p><p>Kaufman stressed: &quot;The defence does not disrespect the soul of any deceased person, nor does it make light of the loss of life.&quot;</p><p>ric/jxb</p></div></article></div>",
