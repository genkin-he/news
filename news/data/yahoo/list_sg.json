area on Saturday.</p><p>A major escalation following months of cross-border violence has seen deadly fighting along the frontier and multiple Pakistani strikes on Afghanistan since Thursday.</p><p>Construction worker Noor Agha, 21, said he was busy tiling &quot;when the Pakistani planes attacked&quot; the site near Takhta Pul village on Saturday.</p><p>&quot;They bombarded the sheds, then we went inside the mountain,&quot; he told AFP, with hills visible in the distance. &quot;Some people were martyred, two or three were wounded.&quot;</p><p>The head of the facility gave a figure of three killed and seven wounded.</p><p>Agha said two strikes hit the site, where a destroyed car sat in front of a building covered in shrapnel marks.</p><p>The Pakistani military did not respond to an AFP request to comment on the incident.</p><p>Construction was underway to support Afghan returnees from Pakistan and Iran, local officials said.</p><p>Around 5.4 million Afghans have entered the country from the two neighbours since late 2023, according to UN figures, largely the result of pushbacks by Tehran and Islamabad.</p><p>Bahawaldin Nazim, the head of the facility, said it

Democrats condemned what they called an illegal aggression.</p><p>&quot;Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions,&quot; including &quot;terrorism,&quot; the murder of Americans and the regime&#39;s sustained nuclear ambitions, Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson said in a statement.</p><p>&quot;We pray for the safety of our brave servicemembers and our allies involved in Operation Epic Fury,&quot; the top Republican in Congress added.</p><p>However, the top Democrat in the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, demanded a briefing to Congress by the Trump administration.</p><p>&quot;The American people do not want another endless and costly war in the Middle East when there are so many problems at home,&quot; he said.</p><p>-

most historic change in the Middle East in a thousand years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It will be violent, extensive and I believe, at the end of the day, successful,&quot; he added in a series of X posts. &quot;The demise of the ayatollah&#39;s regime with American blood on its hands is necessary and more than justified.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a bold, decisive act of strength by President Trump,&quot; hailed senior House Republican Tom Emmer.</p><p>Republicans including Intelligence Committee chairman Tom Cotton, pointed to multiple grievances against Iran, in particular the 1979 hostage crisis and the deadly Beirut bombing of 1983.</p><p>&quot;Iran has waged war against the US for 47 years,&quot; Cotton posted on X. &quot;The butcher&#39;s bill has finally come due for the ayatollahs.&quot;</p><p>Trump has near total control of his Republican Party and dissent is rare.</p><p>Congressman Thomas Massie broke ranks to say: &quot;I am opposed to this war.&quot;</p><div

attack on Iran.</p><p>Senator Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, argued Trump &quot;has thrust our nation into a major war with Iran -- one he never made a case for, never sought congressional authority for, and for which he has no endgame.&quot;</p><p>The administration &quot;has left the American people in the dark about the true costs, risks, and duration of this conflict.&quot;</p><p>Senator Ed Markey slammed Trump&#39;s attack order as &quot;illegal and unconstitutional.&quot;</p><p>Fellow Democratic Senator John Fetterman, among the first to react to the

Afghan security forces said they had downed a Pakistani fighter jet and captured its pilot, which Islamabad denied as &quot;totally untrue&quot;.</p><p>In rural southern Kandahar, construction workers said they were hit by two air strikes, which the manager of the site said killed three people.</p><p>&quot;Everything went dark before our eyes,&quot; said 20-year-old Enamullah, who only gave one name. &quot;I came from Kabul just to earn a piece of bread.&quot;</p><p>Pakistan acknowledged bombing key cities a day earlier including Kabul and Kandahar, which is home to Afghanistan&#39;s supreme leader.

CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Donald Trump&#39;s unleashing of operation &quot;Epic Fury&quot; against Iran has once more underscored the long and bitter struggle between US presidents and Congress over who has the power to decide on foreign military action.</p><p>In his video address announcing &quot;major combat&quot; with the Islamic republic, Trump didn&#39;t once mention any authorization or consultation with the US House of Representatives or Senate.</p><p>In doing so he sidelined not only Democrats, who called for an urgent war powers vote, but also his own Republican party as he asserts his dominance over a largely cowed legislature.</p><p>A US official said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had called top congressional leaders known as the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; to give them a heads up on the Iran attack -- adding that one was unreachable.</p><p>Rubio also &quot;laid out the situation&quot; and consulted with the same leaders on Tuesday in an hour-long briefing, the US official said.</p><p>According to the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war.</p><p>But at the same time the founding document of the United States first signed in 1787 says that the president is the &quot;commander in chief&quot; of the military, a definition that US leaders have in recent years taken very broadly.</p><p>The last official declaration of war by Congress was as far back as World War II.</p><p>There was no such proclamation during the unpopular Vietnam War, and it was then that Congress sought to reassert its powers.</p><p>In 1973 it adopted the War Powers Resolution, passed over Richard Nixon&#39;s veto, to become the only lasting limit on unilateral presidential military action abroad.</p><p>The act allows the president to carry out a limited military intervention to respond to an urgent situation created by an attack against the United States.</p><p>In his video address on Saturday, Trump evoked an &quot;imminent&quot; threat to justify strikes against Iran.</p><p>- Sixty days -</p><p>Yet under this law, the president must still inform Congress within 48 hours.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>It also says that if the president deploys US troops for a military action for more than 60 days, the head of state must then obtain the authorization of Congress for continued action.</p><p>That falls short of an official declaration of war.</p><p>The US Congress notably authorized the use of force in such a way after the September 11, 2011 attacks on the United States by Al-Qaeda. Presidents have used it over the past two decades for not only the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan but a series of operations in several countries linked to the &quot;War on Terror.&quot;</p><p>Trump is far from the first US president to launch military operations without going through Congress.</p><p>Democrat Bill Clinton launched US air strikes against Kosovo in 1999 as part of a NATO campaign, despite the lack of a green light from skeptical lawmakers.</p><p>Barack Obama did the same for airstrikes in Libya in 2011.</p><p>Trump followed their example in his first term in 2018 when he launched airstrikes in Syria along with Britain and France.</p><p>But since his return to power the 79-year-old has sought to push presidential power to its limits, and that includes in the military sphere.</p><p>Trump has ordered strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in Latin America without consulting Congress, and in June 2025 struck Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities.</p><p>Perhaps the most controversial act was when he ordered the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a lightning military raid on January 3.</p><p>Republicans however managed to knock down moves by Democrats for a rare war powers resolution that would have curbed his authority over Venezuela operations.</p><p>Trump has meanwhile sought to extend his powers over the home front. Democrats have slammed the Republican for deploying the National Guard in several US cities in what he calls a crackdown on crime and immigration.</p><p>aue-dk/dw</p></div></article></div>",

oil-rich region&#39;s wealthy rulers.</p><p>Missiles streaked across clear desert skies as smoke plumed from US bases in Manama and Abu Dhabi and loud thuds shook high-rise windows in Dubai.</p><p>In Qatar, dozens of people fled in panic as a falling missile plunged into a residential neighbourhood, erupting in a fireball as it hit the street.</p><p>And in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates&#39; capital, golfers enjoying a quiet round were stunned to see dozens of projectiles flying overhead.</p><p>The Gulf monarchies have worked hard to stay on the periphery of Middle East conflict, relying on their stability to attract business, trade and tourism.</p><p>The staunch US allies have carefully courted Iran, their powerful Shia neighbour. Saudi Arabia, a rival heavyweight, mended ties with Tehran after a seven-year rupture in 2023.</p><p>Given their reputation for calm, Saturday&#39;s sudden attacks on US military bases caused widespread shock among the Gulf&#39;s diverse, expat-heavy populations.</p><p>In Bahrain&#39;s capital Manama, residents were hurriedly evacuated from the Juffair district housing the US navy&#39;s Fifth Fleet, whose base was hit in the attack.</p><p>&quot;When we heard the sounds, we cried out of fear,&quot; said Jana Hassan, a 15-year-old school student, who was visiting a friend in the area.</p><p>&quot;We didn&#39;t know what to do... I will never forget the sound of those loud blasts.&quot;</p><p>In Dubai, the Middle East&#39;s commercial hub with the world&#39;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, residents looked up to see missiles surge through the sky.</p><p>&quot;It was a rumble and then a bang,&quot; one resident told AFP, asking not to be named.</p><p>- &#39;Very scary and very loud&#39; -</p><p>An American resident of Qatar&#39;s capital Doha, who also asked not to be identified, heard two blasts as she was driving home, where she &quot;heard several more and the glass was shaking&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>She said she was &quot;furious&quot; about the instability, after 20 years of living in Qatar. Her teenage sons, she said, are &quot;asking me if we will have to go back home&quot;.</p><p>Qatar was targeted twice last year, when Iran mounted a telegraphed attack on the Al Udeid US base in June and Israel struck a Hamas meeting in Doha in September.</p><p>Those attacks were a Gulf rarity at the time. The UAE had not been troubled since a deadly assault by Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels in 2022, whose attacks on Saudi Arabia have also stopped in recent years.</p><p>&quot;As a Lebanese, I am traumatised,&quot; a 31-year-old expat and mother of two living in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;We came to the Gulf because it&#39;s known to be safer than Lebanon. Now I don&#39;t know what to do or how to think really,&quot; added the woman, who did not want to be named.</p><p>Another Riyadh resident, from Jordan, said: &quot;It was honestly very scary and very loud.</p><p>&quot;I was just walking out with my little boy when we suddenly heard the blast.

New studies show that many of those extensions contain hazardous chemicals. - NickyLloyd/E+/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Almost every Black woman or girl has, at some point, purchased hair extensions for box braids, boho braids, twists or faux locs.</p><p>For many Black women, these “protective styles” are worn year-round to protect and maintain their natural hair. For others, they’re a pre-vacation splurge — an easy way to shield one’s curls from the harshness of salty ocean water or a chlorine-filled pool. Beauty shops feature walls of extension colors — 1b, 30, 27, 24 or maybe even 613 — ready to be purchased and installed by a pro or a patient auntie.</p><p>But a growing number of studies are revealing dozens of potentially dangerous chemicals and carcinogens in these hair extensions: a Consumer Reports study <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/wigs-hair-extensions/braiding-hair-heavy-metals-vocs-follow-up-test-a9549045438/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published this week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published this week</a> found lead in 29 brands of extensions, while a peer-reviewed study <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/hair-extensions-contain-many-more-dangerous-chemicals-previously-thought\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published earlier in February;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published earlier in February</a> found dozens of hazardous chemicals, some of which have been linked with cancer, birth defects and reproductive issues, <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.5c00549\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:across 43 hair samples;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">across 43 hair samples</a>. Some samples in the latter study had chemicals that should have required consumer warning labels under California’s Proposition 65.</p><p>Research has yet to determine whether or not these hair extensions are dangerous or could be causing illness. But both studies indicate how a largely unregulated billion-dollar industry fueled by Black women may also be disproportionately harming them.</p><h3>Hair extensions are still commonly used</h3><p>Elissia Franklin, a research scientist and analytic chemist at the Silent Spring Institute, grew up with “all the Black girl styles,” she said, like box braids, regular braids, relaxed hair and straightened hair. In the past, she’d get rashes on her neck after wearing extensions in her hair, but it wasn’t until she was researching flame retardants in couches as an adult that she realized the same chemicals existed in the hair commonly sold at beauty supply stores.</p><p>Her research, published in February in the American Chemical Society journal Environment &amp; Health, analyzed common brands of both synthetic and human hair purchased online and from local beauty supply stores. Included in those samples: flame retardants, pesticides, organotins (which are linked to skin irritation) and more. More than 80% of the hair samples tested contained chemicals linked to breast cancer specifically, and all but two of the 43 samples tested contained known hazardous chemicals.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034><noscript><img alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Franklin’s work follows a 2025 Consumer Reports study, which made the rounds on social media last year after finding carcinogens in 10 synthetic braiding hair extensions.</p><p>But even as research about these chemicals mounts, business continues as usual in many hair braiding shops across the country.</p><p>The owner of Passion Braiding Salon outside of Austin, Texas said she heard about some chemicals in braiding extension hair on social media a few months ago, but hasn’t heard concerns from clients, most of whom bring hair purchased elsewhere to appointments. When asked if she was worried about her own exposure to harmful products, she said she wasn’t sure.</p><p>Marcy Jones, a braider on the South Side of Chicago, has been braiding hair for seven years. While she has heard of chemicals in hair extensions — some of her clients say they’re “allergic” to the hair, so Jones will pre-wash the extensions — she said she disinfects her tools and isn’t worried about her own exposure.</p><p>One braider at Braids By Queen in Dallas said she wasn’t aware of chemicals in braiding hair, but she always washes any extensions in hot water before use, which she’s done since she was a child in Benin. One Charlotte, North Carolina braider said she hadn’t heard of any risks at all.</p><p>While many people might use hair extensions without obvious problems, irritation is relatively common. Natural hair forums, websites and influencers have for years provided information about these so-called “allergic reactions.” Soaking the hair in apple cider vinegar is a common at-home remedy that may help reduce irritation with mixed results. Still, box braids and other extension styles can start at $200, depending on the length, width and type, and can take up to 10 hours to complete — meaning many Black women have learned to grin and bear the discomfort.</p><p>Hennii Dorsey is a co-owner of The Griyn Thumb salon just outside of Atlanta. She grew up wearing braids with extensions and never had a problem, she said, but that changed about 10 years ago. After braiding her hair with extensions, her head felt like it was covered in red ants, she said, “like they were biting me all over my scalp.”</p><p>“When I looked at my scalp, I noticed it was red, like it was burning,” Dorsey said. “I had to shave it off, that’s how bad the burn was.”</p><p>The braiding hair changed, she said. She began noticing labels like “non-flammable,” making her wonder about the types of chemicals manufacturers treated the hair with. In her own salon, she began warning clients about the potential side effects of hair extensions. Now, she refuses to use hair extensions altogether — synthetic or human.</p><p>Women who want extensions will take the risk no matter what the research says, Dorsey said, “even if they think it’s cancer-causing.”</p><h3>‘What Black hair product is safe?’</h3><p>Though many of the hair braiders interviewed seemed unconcerned by the potential harm they may face, those braiders are the “most vulnerable population,” said Franklin, the researcher. They work with these products day-in and day out, sometimes for decades, seeing multiple clients a week.</p><p>“I do understand where there’s hesitancies,” Franklin said. “What Black hair product is safe? I do think that braiders should be aware, but also so should the manufacturers. It shouldn’t be on the hair braiders to make individual decisions.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517><noscript><img alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>For every Black woman, the calculus around hair safety can feel ever-changing. Relaxers and chemical straighteners, touted for their easy-to-manage outcomes, saw a decline in use as more people learned about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/hair-straightening-formaldehyde-fda-deadline?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde</a>, a key ingredient in relaxer products and a carcinogen.</p><p>Now hair extensions, used by many women as “protective styles” for their natural hair, may also be dangerous, to say nothing of weaves or wigs. And the potential harms exist beyond the hair itself: many brands of gels, glue, edge-control, oil sheen, detangling spray and other everyday products for Black women have been shown to contain <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde-releasing preservatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde-releasing preservatives</a>.</p><p>“Black women use more hair products, and we are doing our hair in these very intense styles, more often than probably any other group of people,” Franklin said. “Those chemicals shouldn’t be in the products.”</p><p>Still, Franklin gets the sense that no one in her circle is shocked anymore, she said. There’s an expectation that some products are hazardous, she said, and there’s no way to really know what product is completely safe. A product considered to be nonhazardous could later prove to be harmful after all.</p><p>Everything carries some sort of risk, Franklin said — our food, our water, even our clothes. Trying to reduce that risk, she said, is all we can do.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

YEFIMOVICH)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Across Israel, city streets stood deserted on Saturday as residents took cover in shelters, while the blasts from Iranian missiles being intercepted reverberated overhead.</p><p>It was the second time in under a year that Israelis were undertaking this grim wartime routine, having first fled Iranian missiles during a 12-day war between the arch-foes last June.</p><p>The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against military targets in Iran on Saturday, sparking a rapid Iranian retaliation towards Israel.</p><p>In the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, Orit Baisa, 42, rushed to an underground car park as soon as he heard the air raid sirens warning of an incoming missile barrage.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t have a shelter, no safe room. The stairwell isn&#39;t a compliant secure room. This (car park) is the safest place there is,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;If this (war) is going to last, then yes, sure, we&#39;ll go back to it, bring the tents, the mattresses, bring all the equipment and live here, like last time&quot;, he told AFP.</p><p>Andrea Siposova, who fled to the same car park, told AFP she had prepared for the shelter in case war broke out.</p><p>&quot;We were already prepared with our emergency backpacks in case this happens. And yeah, so once we got the alert that there is a missile attack, we came to the shelter&quot;, said Siposova, a 31-year-old originally from Slovakia who now lives in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Roi Elba came to the shelter with his dog Gaia to wait out a missile salvo.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s the place to be when it&#39;s unsafe outside. Most of the buildings, most of the apartments in Tel Aviv, in the centre of Tel Aviv, don&#39;t have a safe room, shelter&quot;.</p><p>- Assault rifles and strollers -</p><p>Inside, some people had brought prams, others, who were reservists, their assault rifles while some began praying in a small group.</p><p>Several dogs were there, too, hunkering down with their owners.</p><p>Outside of the car park, white trails scarred the blue sky as Israel&#39;s air defence system launched into action to detonate Iranian missiles before they could land, an AFP journalist reported.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Further north on Israel&#39;s coast, a projectile lifted a large blast of water in Haifa Bay as it exploded in the Mediterranean Sea, water and smoke rising high above a nearby commercial ship, an AFP photojournalist reported.</p><p>After a projectile struck a building in the nearby city of Tirat Carmel, residents were evacuated, according to the same journalist.</p><p>Israel&#39;s first responders agency, Magen David Adom instructed its ambulances to use sirens as little as possible, so as to avoid people confusing the sound for that of air raid sirens, it said in a statement.</p><p>By mid-afternoon on Saturday, it had reported only one mild injury linked to missiles, a 50-year-old man injured by a blast in Israel&#39;s north.</p><p>All other national agencies also sprang into wartime mode, with the education ministry cancelling all classes and the aviation authority halting all flights in and out of the country.</p><p>In Jerusalem, the streets were mostly empty, with residents staying home or close to shelters.</p><p>There too, numerous blasts broke the stillness of the empty streets as barrages came one after the other, sometimes rattling windows as missiles detonated overhead.</p><p>- &#39;Trapped&#39; -</p><p>In the nearby West Bank city of Ramallah, 15 kilometres north of Jerusalem, Palestinians mostly carried on with life as usual, with markets in full swing and conversations only occasionally interrupted by overhead blasts.</p><p>&quot;There have been wars since our great-great-grandparents&#39; time. Nothing concerns us. Our lives must continue as normal&quot;, Ghazala Arar, a resident of the nearby Jalazone camp, told AFP.</p><p>For most, the main inconvenience remained the Israeli military&#39;s closure of many of the hundreds of checkpoints that restrict movement in the Palestinian territory, locking some people out of their homes.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m trying to go to Jenin, but all the checkpoints are closed. The attack happened in an instant -- we are trapped here&quot;, Rajwa Atatra, who had come to Ramallah from the northern city of Jenin to visit her brother, told AFP.</p><p>vid-pho-lba/jd/dcp</p></div></article></div>",

Tehran was moving at its usual pace, taxis and buses were inching through mid-morning traffic and people were running errands.</p><p>Then the routine was shattered by a series of detonations.

with the “failure of diplomacy” stoking tensions in the Middle East and impacting the lives of civilians, said Acting Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Faishal Ibrahim.</p><p>“That these attacks occurred during the holy month of Ramadan deepens the pain felt by many,” he said on Feb 28, adding that the Republic is monitoring events closely and supporting efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/explosion-heard-in-central-tehran-iranian-media-report\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:US and Israel carried out strikes on Iran;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">US and Israel carried out strikes on Iran</a> targeting its leadership on Feb 28, prompting Tehran to retaliate against Israel and US allies in the region, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p><p>Associate Professor Faishal called for calm and wisdom to prevail as he spoke to the media ahead of a community iftar event in Kampong Gelam.</p><p>Besides the ongoing attack initiated by Israel and the US, he also drew attention to the plight of Palestinians, stressing the need for a peaceful resolution in the Middle East.</p><p>He added: “At home, let us remain calm and united, and continue to safeguard the trust and harmony we cherish together.”</p><div

Kang MP Yip Hon Weng said on Facebook that he was “deeply concerned” by the strikes on Iran.</p><p>Mr Yip, who also chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs, said the latest developments “are a stark reminder of how fragile peace can be and how quickly tensions can spiral”.</p><p>He added: “Once again, it is civilians who pay the highest price, through the loss of lives, homes and any sense of safety and normalcy.</p><p>“Here in Singapore, we must never take our peace and harmony for granted. In a world increasingly marked by conflict, our unity across race, religion and nationality is more precious and more vital than ever.”</p><div class=caas-iframely data-embed-anchor=31920fc9-38cd-5bf1-965e-912dfb03b0d4><a data-iframely-url=https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/lFvXHsCg?app=1 data-lazy data-img></a></div><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/strikes-on-iran-and-lebanon-of-concern-to-singapore-faishal-ibrahim?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
