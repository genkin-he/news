Suffice it to say that it’s a threat. We can see that it’s possible.”</p><p>“Beyond just the nuclear program they possess these conventional weapons that are solely designed to attack America and attack Americans, if they so choose to do so. These things have to be addressed,” the top US diplomat said.</p><p>On the nuclear program, Rubio acknowledged that Iran is “not enriching right now,” but said “they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can.”</p><p>However, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff – one of two main US negotiators – claimed in an interview released last Saturday that Iran was “probably a week away from having industrial-grade bombmaking material.” That claim came despite the Trump administration’s repeated assertions that the US had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program in military strikes last year.</p><p>According to a source, intelligence shows that Iran is actively trying to build back its enrichment capability, including installing additional centrifuges, getting back online centrifuges that survived military strikes last year, and rebuilding facilities - many of which were damaged or destroyed - needed to weaponize the enriched uranium.</p><p>However, sources and experts say that work would take far longer than a week. And, according to a source, the work to build back the nuclear program is happening in places that are not likely to be impacted by military strikes.</p><p><em>CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

leader Ali Khamenei, a pillar of its theocratic system since the Islamic revolution, has seen off a succession of crises throughout his rule with a mixture of repression and strategic manoeuvring but now could be facing his biggest challenge.</p><p>The United States and Israel launched strikes against targets in Iranian cities on Saturday, sparking a swift response from the Islamic republic whose Guards announced the launch of a wave of missile and drone attacks at Israel.</p><p>While the scope of the attack on Iran remains to be seen, it could range from the limited to targeting the very apex of the leadership.</p><p>Khamenei, now 86, has dominated Iran for the last three-and-a-half decades since taking on the post for life in 1989 as leader of the Islamic revolution following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>He has remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections, and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.</p><p>He also survived the 2022-2023 &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.</p><p>Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the 12-day war against Israel in June, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.</p><p>But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook the Islamic republic earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.</p><p>- Tight security -</p><p>Khamenei lives under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances are never announced in advance or broadcast live.</p><p>As supreme leader he never sets foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There has long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s right arm is always inert. It was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 authorities have always blamed on the People&#39;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.</p><p>- &#39;I am opposed&#39; -</p><p>Repeatedly arrested under the shah for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei shortly after the Islamic revolution became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the frontline during the Iran-Iraq war.</p><p>He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.</p><p>During the 1980s, Khomeini&#39;s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.</p><p>When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic&#39;s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts met, it was Khamenei who they chose as leader.</p><p>Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, &quot;I am opposed&quot;.&nbsp;But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power has not slackened since.</p><p>Khamenei has now worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures like Mohammad Khatami who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.</p><p>But in the end, Khamenei has always come down on the side of hardliners.</p><p>He is believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, has public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.</p><p>A family dispute has also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><p>Some of their children, including a nephew who is now in France, have become vehement critics.</p><p>sjw/ser</p></div></article></div>",

major attack alongside Israel against Iran, US President Donald Trump is pursuing the goal he once adamantly rejected -- regime change.</p><p>Trump, who has ordered a military buildup in the Middle East unseen since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, made clear in a video address that his goal was to remove the cleric-run state that has long been a US nemesis.</p><p>Trump, who had publicly suggested for weeks a more limited goal of forcing a deal on Iran to end its nuclear program, said that Iran&#39;s missiles will be &quot;obliterated&quot; and said the United States would &quot;annihilate&quot; the Iranian navy.</p><p>Speaking to Iranians, Trump said: &quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This will be, probably, your only chance for generations,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>Indicating coordination, the son of Iran&#39;s late pro-Western shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution, released his own address in which he called for Iranians to wait -- and then seize power.</p><p>&quot;Stay vigilant and ready so that, at the appropriate time -- which I will announce to you precisely -- you can return to the streets for the final action,&quot; said Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the Washington area.</p><p>Trump himself had long criticized US attempts to remake the Middle East.</p><p>In a speech last year in Riyadh, Trump denounced previous US policymakers as failures for seeking to install new systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>&quot;In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,&quot; Trump said in his speech.</p><p>Trump&#39;s close advisor Stephen Miller, in social media posts during the 2024 election, had cast rival Kamala Harris as a warmonger and said &quot;millions die&quot; if she becomes president.</p><p>&quot;Trump said warmongering neocons love sending your kids to die for wars they would never fight themselves,&quot; Miller wrote, posting: &quot;Kamala = WWIII.

sites, and urging Iranians to overthrow their government.</p><p>In a video address after the United States and Israel started bombing Iran, Trump made clear the goal was destruction of the Islamic republic&#39;s military and toppling of the authorities in power since the 1979 revolution.</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally -- again -- obliterated. We&#39;re going to annihilate their navy,&quot; Trump said in the address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform.</p><p>He urged opponents of the Iranian authorities to rise up, saying &quot;the hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>&quot;When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take,&quot; Trump said. This &quot;will be probably your only chance for generations.&quot;</p><p>But in a section of the short speech that was aimed at the US public, Trump acknowledged that &quot;the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost&quot; in what the Pentagon dubbed &quot;Operation Epic Fury.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We may have casualties,&quot; Trump warned.</p><p>Any loss of life on the US side would be politically hazardous for Trump himself, especially after his refusal to seek approval for war against Iran from Congress -- and his own lengthy record of opposing foreign interventions.</p><p>A one-day raid to oust the former strongman leader of Venezuela in January was accomplished without US fatalities. Surgical air strikes on Iran&#39;s main nuclear sites last June also went off without US losses.</p><p>- Bombs &#39;dropping everywhere&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Operation Epic Fury&quot; is on an entirely different scale militarily and politically.</p><p>An attack was widely expected after Trump ordered the biggest military deployment to the Middle East in years. But critical lawmakers have for days been asking why Trump has not addressed the US public or Congress to explain the need for war.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump&#39;s video appeared without warning on his Truth Social site at 2:30 am in Florida, where he was spending the weekend at his luxury golf club.</p><p>Trump, wearing a white baseball cap marked &quot;USA&quot; and no tie with his white shirt and dark jacket, stood at a podium between two flags against a black background.</p><p>He sought to justify the assault on Iran saying: &quot;Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas and could soon reach the American homeland,&quot; he said.</p><p>He urged Iranian forces to surrender, including the elite Revolutionary Guards that is tasked with safeguarding the cleric-run government.</p><p>&quot;To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces, and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity or in the alternative, face certain death.&quot;</p><p>But Trump warned ordinary Iranians that the US bombing would be large-scale.</p><p>&quot;Stay sheltered. Don&#39;t leave your home. It&#39;s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere.&quot;</p><p>Trump on Friday insisted that he had not decided whether to attack, and his envoys on Thursday held talks with Iran&#39;s top diplomat toward a deal on concerns led by Tehran&#39;s nuclear program.</p><p>The top diplomat of Oman, which mediated talks Thursday in Geneva between the United States and Iran, had been optimistic for a compromise.</p><p>He met Friday with US Vice President JD Vance and told CBS News that Iran had agreed to zero stockpiling of enriched uranium that could build an atomic bomb, a goal denied by Tehran.</p><p>bur-sms/jfx</p></div></article></div>",

There, they found a student named Kolton Gray and brought him to the office for questioning.</p><p>Minutes later, Colt Gray began shooting.</p><p>The bizarre, unfortunate name mix-up was revealed in its full extent this week at the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/us/colin-gray-trial-georgia-shooting?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:trial of Colin Gray;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">trial of Colin Gray</a>, the father of the school shooter, on charges of murder and manslaughter.</p><p>The shooting at Apalachee High in Winder, Georgia, on September 4, 2024, left four people dead and nine injured. Colt Gray surrendered to police and has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/us/apalachee-school-shooter-colt-gray-has-waived-arraignment-and-entered-a-not-guilty-plea?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:admitted to the shooting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">admitted to the shooting</a>, according to authorities.

A trial date has not been set.</p><p>Colin Gray, the teen’s father, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/16/us/colin-gray-trial-apalachee-shooting-georgia?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:pleaded not guilty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">pleaded not guilty</a> to charges of murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors say he acted recklessly by buying his son the rifle as a Christmas gift and allowing him access to it despite previous warnings that his son was a danger to others. His defense has said he was unaware his son was planning the shooting and had taken steps to try to get him help.</p><p>The trial has primarily focused on what the father knew about his troubled son and what he did with that knowledge before the attack. But it has also featured dozens of witnesses who have offered key testimony about the day of the attack and the “what-if” moments in which police nearly stopped it before it started.</p><p>In particular, the testimony revealed Colt Gray’s alarming actions and statements prior to the attack: the school’s efforts to locate him that day, the confusion with a similarly named student, and finally the horrific shooting itself.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what we now know about the shooting based on trial testimony so far:</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>Red flags were raised</h3><p>On the morning of September 4, 2024, Colt’s comments and actions raised multiple red flags.</p><p>In his first period class, Colt asked his teacher, Suzanne Harris, if the school had done any active shooter drills, she testified.</p><p>“It was a little bit alarming, and I did send an email to the counselor in regards to that,” Harris testified.</p><p>She noticed Colt was carrying a backpack with a large poster sticking out of the top of it. Shortly after Colt left her classroom, Harris told an administrator she thought he had a gun. “I felt in every fiber of my being that something was wrong,” she testified.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"People attend a vigil following the shooting at Apalachee High School, at Jug Tavern Park in Winder, Georgia, on September 6, 2024. - Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1rKWyFQ0bEk9fug0TT6c8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/687bd6fa335b78c4d5e7bc16a91141bd><noscript><img alt=\"People attend a vigil following the shooting at Apalachee High School, at Jug Tavern Park in Winder, Georgia, on September 6, 2024. - Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1rKWyFQ0bEk9fug0TT6c8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/687bd6fa335b78c4d5e7bc16a91141bd class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>People attend a vigil following the shooting at Apalachee High School, at Jug Tavern Park in Winder, Georgia, on September 6, 2024. - Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>The poster, reading “Happy Mama’s Day,” was wrapped around the part of the firearm that stuck out of the top of the backpack, according to trial evidence.</p><p>At 9:40 a.m., Colt sent several concerning texts to his father that alarmed him, according to phone records.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he wrote to his father. “It’s not ur fault.” Colin Gray, at his construction job, texted him what was wrong, but the teen didn’t respond, text evidence shows.</p><p>Colin Gray then called his estranged wife, Marcee, who called the school guidance counselor, Lisa Butler, at 9:50 a.m. to ask them to check on Colt. Toward the end of that conversation, she told Butler Colt had access to a firearm and had an obsession with school shooters, alarming the counselor, Butler testified.</p><p>Butler relayed the information to Deigh Martin, the assistant principal at Apalachee. Martin and two school resource officers were already searching for Colt Gray based on the teacher’s concerns about his backpack and questions about active shooter training, she testified.</p><h3>Colt Gray vs. Kolton Gray</h3><p>Martin and the officers then went to locate Colt but failed to find him due to a stranger-than-fiction mix-up: another student in the same class was named Kolton Gray.</p><p>At 9:53 a.m., Colt Gray took his backpack and left his second period classroom. His teacher, Katherine Greer, testified he asked to go see a crisis counselor, and she allowed him to do so.</p><p>But instead, Colt took his bag and the weapon inside to the bathroom. There, he texted his mother, “I’m sorry,” and texted his father, “ur not to blame for any of it.”</p><p>At 10:03 a.m., Kolton Gray – seated in the desk next to Colt – got up from his desk and also went to the bathroom.</p><p>At 10:06 a.m., Martin entered the classroom looking for Colt Gray but instead took Kolton Gray’s backpack from the room. A minute later, the two school resource officers entered a nearby bathroom looking for Colt Gray but instead located Kolton Gray and took him to the office for questioning.</p><p>Martin testified they soon realized they had the wrong student and wrong backpack because of their similar names. “We kinda knew that was the mix-up,” she said.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"School shooting suspect Colt Gray exits court after a status hearing in Barrow County, Georgia, on December 9, 2025. - Mike Stewart/Pool/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q9IqkISDLNVkoJoB_hFcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/27825c4418748bfec94d019afe186ef4><noscript><img alt=\"School shooting suspect Colt Gray exits court after a status hearing in Barrow County, Georgia, on December 9, 2025. - Mike Stewart/Pool/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q9IqkISDLNVkoJoB_hFcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/27825c4418748bfec94d019afe186ef4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>School shooting suspect Colt Gray exits court after a status hearing in Barrow County, Georgia, on December 9, 2025. - Mike Stewart/Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>One explanation for the mix-up was that Colt Gray had only attended a few days of school at that point, and school employees did not know what he looked like.</p><p>He did not enroll in any school – online or otherwise – for his entire eighth grade year, school records showed. He missed the first two weeks of his freshman year at Apalachee High, and after that missed more days than he attended leading up to the day of the shooting. His student photo on file with the school was from years prior, so they did not know what he looked like.</p><p>“There was confusion in regards to the name and there was also confusion in regards to Colt Gray himself because he had not been at the school for an extended period of time,” Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Lucas Beyer said. “He was lesser known than Kolton Gray was.”</p><p>Unable to find Colt Gray, Martin said she went to look at the school security cameras to try to figure out what he looked like.</p><p>Meanwhile, Colt Gray remained behind in the bathroom, surveillance video shows. He left the bathroom at 10:21 a.m. wearing yellow gloves, walked toward his classroom and removed the firearm from his backpack, the video shows.</p><h3>Denied entry into his class</h3><p>A female student looked out the door window and saw Colt Gray armed. She alerted Greer, who immediately pressed the emergency button on her badge, locking down the school.</p><p>At 10:22 a.m., unable to enter his own classroom, Colt Gray went to Cassandra Ryan’s nearby algebra class, took three to four steps inside and opened fire for about 10 to 12 seconds, Beyer said.</p><p>“There was gunfire that started happening, and I could feel debris and bullets going over my head,” Ryan said.</p><p>Christian Angulo, a student in the class, was killed, and several other <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/us/colin-gray-trial-apalachee-shooting-testimony?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:students were wounded by gunfire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">students were wounded by gunfire</a>.</p><p>Colt Gray then left the class and walked down the hallway, where he fatally shot teachers Cristina Irimie and Richard Aspinwall and wounded another teacher, David Phenix, according to Beyer. He then fatally shot Mason Schermerhorn, a student who had come out of a bathroom.</p><p>School resource officers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/30/us/apalachee-high-school-officer-church-interview-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Brandon King and Chase Boyd;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Brandon King and Chase Boyd</a> had been searching for Gray when they heard the sound of gunshots, they testified. They sprinted toward the sound and came to a hazy and backlit hallway with limited visibility, they said.</p><p>King saw the outlines of a person standing and loudly said, “Show me your f***ing hands,” he testified. The person immediately got on the ground, lay down in the prone position and put his arms out, he testified.</p><p>Boyd then put the shooter, Colt Gray, in handcuffs. A rifle sat next to him, and magazines were located on his body, he testified.</p><h3>‘I knew it,’ father says</h3><p>Meanwhile, Colin Gray texted his son at 10:23 a.m. – moments after his son had opened fire – and 10:27 a.m., asking him to call and saying he would take the teen out of school, text records show. Colt did not respond.</p><p>At 10:55 a.m., Colin Gray’s daughter Jenni texted him, “I’m scared,” and the father responded, “It’s going to be ok.” She said people had been killed at the high school, and Colin Gray asked how she knew that and whether she had spoken to Colt that day.</p><p>Colin Gray left his construction job at 11:18 a.m. and drove home, arriving at 12:27 p.m., where he saw the Sig Sauer firearm was not in Colt’s room. Police arrived at the home five minutes later to question him, according to body-camera footage.</p><p>“God. I knew it,” he said when they arrived, according to police body-camera footage. “My little girl just texted me – she’s in middle school – she said, ‘We’re in lockdown.’ I’m like, ‘God almighty, please tell me your brother didn’t do something.’”</p><p>CNN’s Nicki Brown, Isabel Rosales, Maxime Tamsett, Chris Youd and Sabrina Castro contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

data-ylk=\"slk:Standard, Plus and Prime classification system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Standard, Plus and Prime classification system</a>, some flats with stricter resale conditions – such as those in Kim Keat Crest, a Plus project – are undersubscribed among first-time applicants.</p><p>This is especially the case for Plus projects in less-than-ideal locations, and three-room flats in Prime projects where other flat types have proven more popular.</p><p>This subdued demand has also contributed to a bigger supply of balance flats.</p><p>Plus and Prime flats are typically closer to the city centre, transport nodes and amenities. As such, they come with stricter resale conditions such as a <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/subsidy-clawback-10-year-mop-for-new-prime-location-hdb-flats-to-keep-them\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) and subsidy clawback,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) and subsidy clawback,</a> with a higher clawback rate for Prime flats.</p><p>This is to limit the “lottery effect” that allows owners of flats in such attractive locations to sell for a substantial profit upon reaching the usual five-year MOP. In contrast, Standard flats have a five-year MOP and no subsidy clawback.</p><p>Prime flats were first rolled out under the Prime Location Public Housing model in November 2021. The current classification system, which introduced Plus flats, was implemented in October 2024.</p><p>In 2021, before stricter resale restrictions kicked in for Prime projects, BTO projects in Bukit Merah, Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Kallang/Whampoa were consistently oversubscribed with around five buyers vying for a four-room flat.</p><p>But in the latest sales exercise, three-room flats at Redhill Peaks in Bukit Merah saw a first-time application rate of below one. This was even though four-room flats in the Prime project were oversubscribed, with more than two first-time applicants per unit.</p><p>At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>And the supply of balance flats could have increased as a result.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zHf415CxU__xPLFKd0FKhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/4ce5920895dc61633d01ec61f85d34bc><noscript><img alt=\"At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zHf415CxU__xPLFKd0FKhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/4ce5920895dc61633d01ec61f85d34bc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>At the previous launch in October 2025, three- and four-room flats in Plus project Oak Ville @ AMK were also undersubscribed among first-time buyers.</figcaption></div></figure><p>In the February sales exercise, some 4,320 balance flats were put up for sale, more than the 3,000 units that the HDB had initially committed to.</p><p>Many of these unsold flats from earlier BTO exercises turned out to be Prime and Plus flats in Bukit Merah, Kallang/Whampoa and Queenstown.</p><p>Checks by The Straits Times showed that 22 Prime or Plus BTO projects were among those that offered balance flats. Of these, 13 projects saw at least one flat type undersubscribed during its initial launch.</p><p>In particular, three-room flats in Prime projects tended to have low application rates.</p><p>Even after the most recent sales exercise concluded on Feb 11, three- and four-room balance flats in Queenstown – which had a mix of Prime and Standard flats – remained undersubscribed among first-time applicants.</p><p>Demand was also muted for Prime and Plus balance flats in Bukit Merah and Kallang/Whampoa.</p><p>In a written parliamentary reply on Feb 25, National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat said HDB currently has close to 900 unselected flats from Sale of Balance Flats exercises. These flats – mostly three-room and larger – are located all over Singapore.</p><p>The softer demand for Prime and Plus flats can be partly explained by HDB ramping up flat supply post-pandemic. Between 2021 and 2025, some 102,400 new flats were launched.</p><p>As a result, application rates for BTO flats have come down since 2020, when the median rate for three-room and larger flats stood at seven, meaning that there were seven applicants for each flat.</p><p>In 2025, the rate dipped to between 1.1 and 1.9.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 2646px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:213%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VV2DWnfhT8u_Jl_P9jnweg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNjQ2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/78631315caed6b2dc33f643eb0ce9556><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VV2DWnfhT8u_Jl_P9jnweg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNjQ2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/78631315caed6b2dc33f643eb0ce9556 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>In the HDB resale market, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-resale-prices-rose-2-9-in-2025-slowest-growth-since-2019\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:resale prices were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">resale prices were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2025</a> – a respite from the continuous quarterly price growth since the second quarter of 2020.</p><p>These figures indicate that housing demand has largely moderated.</p><p>But there are other reasons why some Prime and Plus flats are undersubscribed, just over a year into the new flat classification system.</p><h2>Why the muted demand?</h2><p>First, first-time home buyers are weighing whether stricter resale conditions – in particular, the 10-year MOP – are worth it.</p><p>Speculative buyers are weeded out, while serious buyers who intend to live in their flats for the long run are given a higher chance to book one. This is the intended effect of the policy.</p><p>However, three-room flats may not be popular among young families given the space constraints, as they are typically around 60 to 68 sq m. In comparison, new four-room flats are around 88 to 93 sq m.</p><p>Families are likely keeping in mind the space needed to grow their family in the years after collecting their keys. With a 10-year MOP to contend with, many would opt for a bigger flat to accommodate their children’s needs.</p><p>Over time, this could lead to an accumulation of unsold three-room Prime and Plus balance flats.</p><h2>Some locations not desirable enough</h2><p>A second reason for the weaker demand is that some Plus projects may not be in locations that are desirable enough for buyers to stomach the additional restrictions that will apply.</p><p>For example, property analysts pointed out that Kim Keat Crest in Toa Payoh is a distance from Toa Payoh Central. It is a 20-minute walk or 10-minute bus ride from Toa Payoh MRT station.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 2487px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:200%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RtOUZ6qyCORXt.kOxsEt1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNDg3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/5cca0dac79e0db4f610a39ef047770f6><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RtOUZ6qyCORXt.kOxsEt1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0yNDg3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/5cca0dac79e0db4f610a39ef047770f6 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>Mr Eugene Lim, key executive officer of property agency ERA Singapore, said most applicants who are willing to take on the strict resale restrictions for Plus flats look for advantageous location attributes, such as being within walking distance of an MRT station.</p><p>“Flats that require a longer commute to the MRT are commonly classified as Standard,” he noted. “Hence, they might be discouraged from applying for this project.”</p><p>In contrast, application rates for two Tampines BTO projects – one of which was a Plus project in the heart of Tampines Central – saw high demand, with more than seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.</p><p>The Plus project, Tampines Nova, is a five-minute walk from Tampines MRT station and Our Tampines Hub, and there are three shopping malls and various amenities in the area.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 745px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:60%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MStTU5OCWNv1G3Mnb7qlig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03NDU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ab4f99f12ae0baa9c09010e63fc290b9><noscript><img alt=\"The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MStTU5OCWNv1G3Mnb7qlig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD03NDU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ab4f99f12ae0baa9c09010e63fc290b9 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The Plus project, Tampines Nova, saw high demand, with over seven first-time applicants vying for each of the four-room flats.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at property firm Realion (OrangeTee &amp; ETC) Group, said this is a rare site given the scarcity of land for new development in the Tampines Central area.</p><p>“Projects situated near MRT stations will continue to appeal to buyers, given the convenience (they offer),” she added.</p><p>It is unclear if projects in towns such as Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh fall under the Plus or Prime classification by default, given their proximity to the city centre, or if future projects in such towns may be classified as Standard projects if they are farther from the town centre.</p><p>A clearer picture of how the flat classification system works would help buyers make a more informed decision on the projects to apply for, based on the conditions they are willing to take on.</p><p>This is already the case for BTO launches.</p><p>Alongside each launch, HDB releases the locations of the projects in the following launch. These details allow buyers to decide which launch to apply for, given that applicants with a queue number cannot apply for subsequent sales exercises.</p><p>The muted demand for three-room flats also serves as a signal to HDB on how to adjust future flat supply.</p><p>Mr Chee had previously acknowledged that there is demand for five-room flats in Prime and Plus projects, where such flat types are not available.</p><p>If more five-room flats are built, the trade-off is fewer units of other types, he told reporters in January. But he also empathised with the needs of larger families, saying that he “will see what we can do to build more five-room flats” without reducing supply elsewhere.</p><p>Rather than leaving unsold flats on the market, it might be prudent for the HDB to adjust the three-room flat supply, so as to cater to the demand for four-room and larger flats.</p><p>To be clear, a glut of such unsold flats – reminiscent of what Singapore saw in the late 1990s – is unlikely to happen, given the overall firm housing demand today.</p><p>And a pool of unsold flats is not necessarily a bad thing, as these can be offered as balance flats to those with more urgent housing needs.</p><p>As a whole, the current classification system has made flats in attractive locations more accessible to serious buyers.</p><p>But recent application trends have also pointed to dampened demand in certain locations and among certain flat types.</p><p>Such an outcome is perhaps not the intended outcome of the Build-To-Order system, which is designed such that flat supply is fundamentally driven by demand.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/muted-demand-for-some-plus-prime-hdb-flats-as-first-time-buyers-weigh-stricter-resale-conditions?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

expressed frustration at Iran&#39;s stance in negotiations over its nuclear and missile programmes.</p><p>Trump said Washington&#39;s goal was &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot; from Iran, and Israel&#39;s defence minister Israel Katz described the action as a &quot;preventive strike&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The United States&#39; military began major combat operations in Iran,&quot; Trump said in a video message posted on his social media site while he spent the weekend at his Florida golf club.</p><p>&quot;We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally, again, obliterated. We&#39;re going to annihilate their navy,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>He offered the Iranian military &quot;immunity&quot; or &quot;certain death&quot; and told Iranians the &quot;hour of your freedom is at hand&quot;.</p><p>Iranian state television reported that President Pezeshkian was &quot;safe and sound&quot; and the Fars news agency said &quot;seven missile impacts were reported in the Keshvardoost and Pasteur districts&quot; of Tehran.</p><p>&quot;I saw with my own eyes two Tomahawk missiles flying horizontally toward targets,&quot; an office worker told AFP on condition of anonymity. &quot;At first we heard a dull noise and thought it was a fighter jet.&quot;</p><p>In Tehran, AFP journalists heard blasts and saw two large columns of smoke rising over the city centre. The health ministry said ambulances had been dispatched but there was no immediate confirmation of casualties.</p><p>Iran, Iraq and Israel all closed their airspaces to civilian traffic once the strikes were underway, and the US embassies in Qatar and Bahrain urged US citizens to take shelter.</p><p>Sirens sounded in Jerusalem and Israeli authorities issued a cellphone warning for citizens.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump had ordered the biggest military build-up in decades in the Middle East, with the world&#39;s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R.
