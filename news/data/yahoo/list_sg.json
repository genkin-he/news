Roger Wicker of Mississippi) said Friday. The Trump administration has not publicly released the basis for its growing offensive, but there have reportedly been internal struggles over whether the strikes are justifiable, and fears of being seen as arguing otherwise among government lawyers. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who led the U.S. Southern Command, retired earlier this month after clashing with Hegseth over the legality of the attacks, according to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>CNN</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Among those monitoring the situation is Harrison Mann, a 13-year Army officer now with the progressive group Win Without War. Mann. Mann quit his last military job at the Defense Intelligence Agency over U.S. support for Israel’s devastating offensive in Gaza, which itself appeared to violate U.S. and international law, and has in recent weeks helped organize a national campaign of billboards and other outreach called “Not What You Signed Up For?” to inform U.S. soldiers about resources for legal counseling and community support as the Trump administration has used the military in unprecedented ways abroad and domestically. It’s “a frightening and isolating experience” to receive orders that may be unlawful and try to assess how to react and it’s “increasingly a possibility,” Mann said, so the effort seeks to help individuals avoid violations.</span></p><p><span>HuffPost discussed developments around Venezuela with Mann on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56><noscript><img alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America. <span class=\"copyright\">OUTFRONT Media</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><strong>Thinking back to being on the inside at a moment like this, with the U.S. spiraling into conflict and a pretty unclear mission, whether narcotics or regime change, how would you be feeling about it — and how do you imagine folks being asked to carry out these orders in Latin America are? What are their options? And what’s your sense of whether legal efforts, like court challenges against the Trump administration’s domestic deployment of troops, will be fast enough to catch up, given how quickly the actual deployments are moving?</strong></p><p><span>A lot of them are probably hoping that they don’t get asked to do something illegal. When we look at all the strikes on boats that have happened so far, that’s dozens, probably hundreds, of uniformed service members in terms of how many it takes from getting an order to actually dropping a bomb or doing a drone strike on one of these boats who participated in something that they were quite confident was not legal. That’s still a small minority of all of the troops who have now been deployed to the region, between the Air Force and the growing number of Navy ships that we have outside of Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-adelita-grijavla_n_69052e61e4b0060501ac5325?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay</a></strong></p><p><span>In government in general, at higher echelons you have lawyers who are assigned to you who are meant to be your counsel, JAGs if you’re in the military. But as you go further down the ranks, you don’t have legal consultation. If you’re a more junior officer or a junior enlisted, you’re taking it on good faith that the orders you’re receiving have been run through some kind of legal review and are going to be lawful, and I think that assumption is increasingly in question with how this administration has deployed the military both in the Caribbean and in American cities. Our campaign put a billboard [near] SOUTHCOM but we started with National Guard deployments and the broader issue of the administration trying to use the military in illegal ways… which has both moral implications and legal implications for the people who choose to give those orders and the people who choose to carry them out.</span></p><p><span>I hope that legal challenges carry the day, but I don’t think it’s wise to expect that or have total faith that that’s gonna happen. In terms of domestic deployments, if the president invokes the Insurrection Act, then he can put both Guard and active-duty troops basically anywhere he wants. And when we’re talking about overseas strikes and the potential war in Venezuela, the legal constraints to that were really abandoned a long time ago with Congress abandoning its role in constructing and containing foreign policy. In some ways the boat strikes are crossing new red lines in terms of illegal use of the military but a lot of folks have pointed out that the legal justifications for these strikes are not dramatically flimsier than the justifications for a lot of bombings around the Middle East for the past 10-plus years over multiple presidents. There was already a precedent that the president could blow up anybody who he said was a terrorist to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The scariest part from an American perspective about the strikes in the Caribbean so far is that at the same time that members of the Trump administration are calling a broad swath of Americans terrorists, via [</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:National Security Presidential Memorandum 7;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>National Security Presidential Memorandum 7</span></a><span>] and via public statements by people like Stephen Miller, they’re also asserting their right to drone strike anybody the president calls a terrorist.</span></p><p><strong>We’re at this moment after chaos in Hegseth’s office, the firing of a lot of top commanders, skipping over some to appoint those perceived as loyal, and removing an independent press corps at the Pentagon. Is the U.S. military establishment in a position to be managing this kind of operation and how concerned are you about transparency and the chain of command now?</strong></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-times-trump-prediction_n_690507c2e4b0b48d8a1c6705?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump</a></strong></p><p><span>Are they administratively capable of continuing to bomb people?

What we don’t know is whether the officers who take their place are going to feel the same way. What I can’t tell you is how much solidarity there is at the flag officer rank… or if that replacement is going to learn the lesson that Hegseth is trying to teach them, which is “get in line or I’ll fire you.” It remains to be seen what behavior we’re going to see from our upper echelon in military leadership.</span></p><p><strong>Presidents finding creative legal justifications to kill people abroad and Congress letting them do it is not new. Looking at the escalation now and the limited guardrails against it, are you thinking about lessons that could have been learned from the post-9/11 War on Terror? And specifically lessons from U.S. intervention in Latin America for decades? How is that history being overlooked and what could we take from it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>We should understand these events as continuation of the War on Terror – we never rejected that logic. We pulled some troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the idea we should be unilaterally bombing without a clear connection to how that makes Americans safer and the contention that anybody you call a terrorist is somebody you can then bomb or detain or otherwise mistreat outside of the law was never really challenged.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The lesson I would hope we learned from America’s history in Latin America is that setting aside the moral objections to regime change in countries in the region, it’s also disastrous for us politically and economically. Whatever you think of Venezuela now, turning it into a warzone is not going to make it more stable, solve the economic crisis there or stem the refugees that are flowing into neighboring countries and contributing to burdening some of the resources of countries in the region. The lesson that folks like [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio learned is that we just didn’t try hard enough in the 1980s and now we finally have an opportunity to finish the job. Their theory is that if you regime-change Venezuela, that will cut off their oil to Cuba, so then you can regime-change Cuba. These people learned no lesson of not giving up on the foreign policy of 50 or 60 years ago.</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-snap-food-stamps_n_6904f12de4b00c26f071625a?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits</a></strong></p><p><strong>The anti-war movement generally faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Some have felt that with Trump’s “America First” line and MAGA base, which questioned intervention against Iran alongside Israel, those conservatives could be helpful. How are you thinking about organizing around this?</strong></p><p><span>In</span><span>execution, “America First” seems to have led to a lot of foreign interventions. I am encouraged when Americans from every political affiliation oppose dangerous and unnecessary foreign intervention; it’s to me too soon to see whether that has translated into an actually more rational foreign policy. The trend you’re talking about certainly exists … but it’s way too soon to say that it’s really going to restrain the foreign policy of the president or of his party. I wish it did, I hope it does, but it certainly seems that the death of the neocons has been highly exaggerated.</span></p><p><span>One aspect of Trump’s second term is that he’s performing exaggerated versions of policies that we’ve had for 20 years and he’s doing it without attempting to justify it in moral terms, and that makes it easier for a lot of people to understand why this kind of interventionism is wrong. On Capitol Hill, some representatives who were not interested in pushing back against foreign interventions are getting a little more interested. In part because of the awakening effect of U.S. support for the genocide in Gaza, there’s certainly a lot more Americans who are paying attention to how the U.S. comports itself abroad. I’ve been heartened to see at least in the Democratic Party pretty consistent positions against these interventions without a lot of equivocating, and to see some Republicans start at least rhetorically moving against them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ll have to see what votes come out for a war powers resolution against intervention in Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My organization sees this as a moment to explain to people in this country and to elected leaders why they have to pay attention to the connection between foreign policy and our lives here at home. And I think putting the National Guard in our streets while we start blowing up random people in boats makes it a lot easier to explain that what we do overseas doesn’t stay there.</span></p><p><strong>Sufficient pushback, a climbdown by Venezuela or just Trump volatility are probably our ways out of this, or maybe it’s some combination of all three. In terms of damage and danger until that happens, what barometers will you track to understand this situation, in terms of human life, violations of U.S. and international law and broader instability going forward?</strong></p><p><span>Domestically I’ll be looking at how many members of Congress and other institutions speak out against it and try to prevent it. I’m personally thinking about what echelons of our military leadership acquiesce versus push back against what could be patently unlawful orders... we shouldn’t assume the first strike is gonna be on a Venezuelan military base. It could be something the administration thinks is a drug lab but turns out to be somebody’s house; it could be civilian or political leadership. If and when this begins, there’s already been a massive economic refugee outflow from Venezuela in part because of sanctions we’ve applied. I’ll be looking at not just the loss of life but the number of people who have to flee.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ve seen Trump personally be satisfied with showy actions that he can call a win. Iran fits that bill, to a lesser extent the Gaza ceasefire [in January] did. I don’t know whether that will work in Venezuela given the success so far of his hawks, which in this case includes both [Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor] Stephen Miller and Marco Rubio.</span></p><p><em><span>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/snap-websites-are-hitting-back-at-the-gop-by-giving-them-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine_n_6904ecb8e4b0b48d8a1c505f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-the-view_n_69047b34e4b0d05408abd167?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rand-paul-slams-trump-strike-venezuela-drug-vessel_n_68b989f3e4b0e20f601acde8?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-venezuela-escalation-war_n_69052bc3e4b0060501ac52e2?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

She told Fox News in 2024 that her parents&#39; Hindu religion helped make them &quot;really good people.&quot;</p><p>Vance was raised as an evangelical in a chaotic and sometimes deprived upbringing that he described in his memoir &quot;Hillbilly Elegy.&quot;</p><p>The couple met at Yale Law School and married in 2014.</p><p>Since Vance&#39;s conversion to Catholicism five years later, he has frequently spoken about how his faith has informed his conservative political views.</p><p>dk/aha</p></div></article></div>",

Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.</p><p>A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.</p><p>The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.</p><p>Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.</p><p>By contrast, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and neighboring Myrnohrad was tightening.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk.

The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.</p><p>Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.</p><p>Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.</p><h3>Pipelines blown up</h3><p>As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.</p><p>On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.</p><p>“The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine</figcaption></div></figure><p>It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting.

We last talked around the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when nuclear threats were also in the news.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Our conversation about the developments this week, conducted by email and edited for length and style, is below:</p><h3>What do Putin and Trump mean by ‘nuclear test’?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Both Trump and Putin referred to nuclear tests this week, but neither the US nor Russia is supposed to have tested nuclear weapons since the ‘90s. What did you make of Russia’s test and the US response? Is this the kind of coercive diplomacy you’ve written about or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> It’s firstly important to clarify what we mean by a “nuclear test.” Russia has tested missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. But, in the traditional sense, a nuclear test is a denotation of a nuclear explosive device. Think of the July 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert that you may have seen depicted in the 2023 film “Oppenheimer” (although after the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, most nuclear explosive tests were done underground rather than in the atmosphere). This is not what Russia has done, and I don’t believe this is what the US is threatening to resume, either.</p><p>There are two main reasons why countries test military technologies. The first is to see whether a weapon works as designed. The second is to send a political message to other countries. I think there’s a certain amount of signaling attached to Russia’s recent missile tests. Although it’s difficult to decipher Moscow’s intentions, in testing these technologies, the Kremlin may be implicitly saying to the United States and NATO: Back off in Ukraine — look what we might do if you continue to interfere.</p><h3>More worried about a nuclear crisis today than four years ago</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Do you generally think the threat of a nuclear standoff has increased in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>I’m more worried about the possibility of a serious nuclear crisis today than I was at the end of 2021. This is in large part because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the possibility that Moscow may continue to brandish its nuclear arsenal to help it prevail in that war. But it’s not just that. The possibility of a US-China nuclear standoff over Taiwan is not trivial, especially if one side misinterprets the other’s resolve to fight. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are expanding too, and there is the potential for disaster on the Korean Peninsula arising from an accident or miscalculation. Not to mention the perennial possibility of a nuclear-tinged crisis between India and Pakistan. This doesn’t mean that the probability of a standoff is high. Actually, I still think it’s relatively low. But given the stakes involved, even a small increase in the risk — say, 2% — is cause for concern.</p><h3>Do US missile defenses work?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Coincidentally, there’s a movie on Netflix about the 30 minutes it would take for an intercontinental ballistic missile to reach the US and the difficulty of intercepting such a missile. The Pentagon felt the need to produce a memo responding to the film. Are missile defense systems any better than the coin toss suggested by the movie?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’ll leave that question to technical experts who understand the intricacies of missile defense systems better than I do. I will say that, from a strategic standpoint, there’s value in convincing your adversaries that your missile defense systems are impenetrable. This can strengthen deterrence: If adversaries believe their missiles won’t get through, they may be less likely to fire them.</p><h3>Would Trump’s Golden Dome solve the nuclear threat?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Trump (taking cues from Project 2025) has called for a new “</strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/golden-dome-missile-test-election?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Golden Dome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong>Golden Dome</strong></a><strong>” missile defense shield. Is it worth the cost and would that do anything to solve the nuclear threat?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>That’s a complicated question. On the surface, missile defense sounds great – and in some ways it is. Consider, for example, the relatively high rate at which Israel successfully shot down missiles fired by Iran in their war over the summer. However, in the long run, developing these systems can encourage your adversaries to develop technologies that circumvent your defenses, or to develop missile defenses of their own. In the end, you may get a costly arms race that leaves both sides worse off. The United States and the Soviet Union recognized this during the Cold War, which is one reason they agreed to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p><h3>Will the expiring Obama-era nuclear treaty be renegotiated?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: The US and Russia have a nuclear arms treaty that expires in February. New START, negotiated during the Obama administration, limits the size of the countries’ nuclear stockpiles. Will it be renegotiated?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The prospects currently look bleak. As long as there is tension over the war in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine Russia agreeing to a new arms control deal with the United States. If that tension is alleviated, the prospects for a deal would improve.</p><h3>What about China?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Should China or other countries be a part of that process?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>Many US policymakers would like to include China as part of an arms control deal with Russia. The problem is that China’s nuclear capabilities currently lag behind Russia and the United States. Countries usually don’t like to negotiate from a position of weakness. As China’s nuclear arsenal expands — a trend that is happening — a trilateral deal becomes more likely, especially if Beijing achieves parity with the other two countries.</p><h3>Bring back the test ban treaty?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the 1990s but failed to get the US Senate to ratify it. Trump isn’t talking about reviving it, but if he could get the handful of nuclear powers that have likewise not ratified the test ban treaty — including China, Russia, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel — to ratify it, would he be a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The US Senate vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999 was a setback for global nonproliferation. There are obstacles to bringing the CTBT into force in the current political environment. If the Trump administration was able to get this done, it would be a major foreign policy achievement.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Jersey and Virginia</a> are heading into the final weekend in a slightly stronger position than Kamala Harris was at the same time last year.</p><p>In New York City, <a

data-ylk=\"slk:Zohran Mamdani’s base;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Zohran Mamdani’s base</a>.</p><p>CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.</p><p>Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.</p><h3>New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage</h3><p>In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.</p><p>Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.</p><p>Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.</p><h3>New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up</h3><p>Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).</p><p>That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.</p><p>Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.</p><p>This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.</p><p>Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.</p><p>The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.</p><p>Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.</p><h3>Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position</h3><p>While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.</p><p>The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.</p><p>Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.</p><p>And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as <a href=\"https://vote.arlingtonva.gov/Early-Voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Arlington;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Arlington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/early-voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fairfax;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Fairfax</a>.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Those moments remind me how fragile and imperfect these early pronouncements really are — and how much pain they can cause when we cling to them too tightly.</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>That grief is real — but it’s also a hurt I can attempt to prevent for myself and for this baby by not getting attached to a tidbit of information that may or may not line up with who they truly are. By choosing not to know, I’m giving them a little more space to arrive in this world without everyone’s projections already waiting for them — space to simply </span><em><span>be</span></em><span>, before the world starts telling them who they’re supposed to be.</span></p><p><span>And given how <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:small the percentage of trans people is;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">small the percentage of trans people is</a>, this choice is less about predicting whether I will have a trans kid or not and more about committing to a practice of generational change, one where we allow children to explore who they are beyond the limitations of the binary, on their own timeline, with their own voice.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/husband-hearse-death-halloween-decoration_n_68f7bf30e4b0dbac45915c5d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Screamed When I Saw What Was Parked In Our Driveway.

Then I Learned My Husband Had Bought It.</a></strong></p><p><span>When those kids grow up and realize those expectations don’t fit, they have to do the hard work of disentangling who they are from who the world told them to be. I know I can’t protect my own child from every expectation, but I can choose not to start the narrative for them before they’re even born.</span></p><p><span>That doesn’t mean it’s easy. There’s a part of me that is wildly curious — who wouldn’t be? There’s a reason gender reveals are so popular (despite the fact that what’s being “revealed” is really just anatomy). We crave certainty. Pregnancy can feel like nine months of questions, so knowing even one thing feels like a lifeline.</span></p><p><span>When the tech asked us to close our eyes, I squeezed my husband’s hand. I felt the tug of wanting to know, of wanting to imagine who this baby is going to be. But then I reminded myself that knowing the sex wouldn’t really answer that question. It would just give me a category, one our culture fills in with a thousand assumptions.</span></p><p><span>When people find out we’re not finding out, their reactions range from nostalgic to a little anxious.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pelvic-organ-prolapse-40s-women-poop-symptoms_n_68fba9eee4b004dff450f0ec?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Developed A Condition In My Mid-40s That Made It Impossible To Poop Normally — And It Gets Even More Embarrassing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">I Developed A Condition In My Mid-40s That Made It Impossible To Poop Normally — And It Gets Even More Embarrassing</a></strong></p><p><span>Older generations often smile and tell me how wonderful they think it is. “We never used to know,” they say, “and life has so few true surprises left.” They seem genuinely delighted that we are letting this be one of them.</span></p><p><span>It’s the Gen Xers and millennials who are most likely to say things like, “You are so brave!” or my other favorite: “I could never do that — I’m such a planner.”</span></p><p><span>I usually laugh and reassure them that I still have a plan: for diapers, wipes, a safe car seat and a stocked freezer. Not knowing the sex doesn’t mean I’m unprepared. It just means I’m prepared for whoever this baby turns out to be. </span></p><p><span>I’ll admit I feel a certain amount of pressure to keep my credibility — I am a gender specialist, after all — and I also see this as an opportunity to gently challenge the people in our lives. The ones who have struggled the most with what to buy this “unknown” baby are often the ones who might project the strongest gendered assumptions onto them. I’d rather give them the gift of practicing something different before the baby even arrives.</span></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=\"caas-blockquote caas-pull-quote\"><span class=\"quotemark icon\"><svg width=42 height=29 viewBox=\"0 0 20 14\"><path d=\"M15.5222734,14 C18.5215054,14 20,12.4159021 20,9.76146789 C20,7.23547401 18.7327189,5.90825688 16.3248848,5.73700306 C16.8740399,3.93883792 17.8456221,2.01223242 18.9016897,0.29969419 L18.9016897,0 L14.3394777,0 C12.6075269,2.6116208 10.8333333,6.03669725 10.8333333,9.03363914 C10.8333333,12.2446483 12.3963134,14 15.5222734,14 Z M4.70948012,14 C7.6529052,14 9.16666667,12.4159021 9.16666667,9.76146789 C9.16666667,7.23547401 7.82110092,5.86544343 5.46636086,5.73700306 C6.01299694,3.93883792 6.98012232,2.01223242 8.0733945,0.29969419 L8.0733945,0 L3.53211009,0 C1.80810398,2.6116208 0,6.03669725 0,9.03363914 C0,12.2446483 1.5558104,14 4.70948012,14 Z\" /></svg></span><p>Choosing not to find out is more than a preference — it’s practice.</p></blockquote></div><p>When a colleague asked if I was going to do the “sad beige” thing, where every item in the nursery is cream, tan, or muted gray, I laughed and said I’m doing the exact opposite.

Her Response Changed My Life.</a></strong></p><p>As a parent, I will spend years making decisions about how to protect this child’s autonomy, how to let them express who they are, and how to resist the pressure to force them into boxes that don’t fit. Not finding out the sex is my first chance to practice setting boundaries about how much of my child’s identity I share with the world.</p><p>It’s also my chance to sit with uncertainty, which is something parents of trans kids have to do all the time. Will my child be comfortable in their gender? Will they need support in exploring it? I can’t know those answers yet, and I don’t need to. My job isn’t to have a plan for every possibility — it’s to create the kind of family where every possibility is safe.</p><p>This pregnancy has already been an exercise in acceptance. After months of fertility treatment, I learned over and over that I could not control the outcome — only how I showed up for the process. More than anything, I am just grateful to be pregnant, grateful to get the chance to meet whoever they are.</p><p>The truth is, I don’t need to know the sex of my baby to know they are already a whole person. They are someone who does somersaults after I eat ice cream, tap dances dramatically when I try to fall asleep on my left side, and saves their strongest kicks for the middle of my therapy sessions — almost as if to affirm what’s being said.</p><p>This child is already teaching me patience, flexibility and humility. They are already making me laugh. They are already someone I love fiercely — and none of that depends on the sex printed on an ultrasound report.</p><p>One day, I will meet this baby and learn more about who they are. I will learn what makes them laugh, what soothes them when they cry, and what they notice first when we go outside. And over time, they will reveal themselves to me in ways no ultrasound ever could.</p><p>That, to me, is the real reveal — not a moment at 20 weeks, but a lifetime of getting to know each other.</p><p>I’m not suggesting everyone should make the same choice I did. But I do hope more parents pause before they start writing the story of who their baby will be. Whether or not you find out the sex, you still get to decide how rigidly you cling to gendered expectations.</p><p>You get to decide whether your child’s closet will only be filled with blue onesies and dinosaurs or pink dresses and bows — or whether it will hold a little bit of everything. You get to decide whether you tell them who they are, or let them tell you.</p><p>For me, not finding out the sex is one way of saying:<em> I’m ready to meet you, whoever you are — as you discover that in your own time, and on your own terms. </em></p><p><em>Rebecca Minor, LICSW, is a queer clinician, consultant, and educator specializing in trauma, gender, and sexuality.

old ties at an Asian summit from which US leader Donald Trump was largely absent.</p><p>The talks on the sidelines of the APEC gathering came on the final day of Xi&#39;s first trip to South Korea in more than a decade and a day after his meeting with Canada&#39;s premier reset damaged ties.</p><p>Trump flew to South Korea for the summit but promptly jetted home on Thursday after sealing a trade war pause with Xi, the pair agreeing to dial down a dispute that has roiled markets and disrupted global supply chains.</p><p>His departure left the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where he framed Beijing as a responsible power against the chaos unleashed by the United States on the international order.</p><p>Lee welcomed Xi at a grand opening ceremony complete with soldiers wearing traditional garb.</p><p>The visit was the Chinese leader&#39;s first since 2014 and comes after years of strained ties over everything from trade to cultural disputes.</p><p>Lee told Xi he had &quot;long looked forward to meeting you in person&quot; and framed his trip as a reset in relations.</p><p>&quot;As our two countries move from a vertical structure of economic cooperation to a more horizontal and mutually beneficial one, we must work together to build a relationship that delivers shared prosperity,&quot; Lee told Xi, whose vast economy represents South Korea&#39;s largest trading partner.</p><p>Xi, in turn, described China and South Korea as &quot;important neighbours that cannot be moved and also partners that cannot be separated&quot;.</p><p>He told Lee that the two countries should &quot;respect each other&#39;s societal differences and development paths...

FASSBENDER)</figcaption></div></figure><p>China said on Saturday it will exempt some Nexperia chips from an export ban that was imposed over a row with Dutch officials and has alarmed European businesses.</p><p>Anxiety over chip shortages began when the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government.</p><p>China, in response, banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s Chinese CEO.</p><p>Beijing blamed what it said on Saturday was &quot;the Dutch government&#39;s improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises&quot; for leading to &quot;the current chaos in the global supply chain&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,&quot; a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement, without offering specifics.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Those talks on Friday were &quot;a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on... the introduction and implementation of export controls&quot;, Gill said in a statement on Saturday.</p><p>The discussions covered &quot;controls on rare earth elements introduced or proposed by China, as well as an update on controls and developments on the EU side&quot;, he said.</p><p>The statement did not mention Nexperia specifically.</p><p>Separately, Berlin welcomed Beijing&#39;s move as a &quot;positive sign&quot; on Saturday.</p><p>&quot;The latest reports from China are positive initial signs of an easing of tensions,&quot; an economy ministry spokesman told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He stressed that &quot;a final assessment&quot; of the implications of Beijing&#39;s announcement was not yet possible.</p><p>- Automaker anxiety -</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>Its chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components, as well as consumer and mobile electronics such as refrigerators.</p><p>The company makes them in Europe before sending them to China for finishing and then re-exporting them back to European clients.</p><p>European carmakers and parts suppliers had warned of shortages of chips supplied by Nexperia that would force stoppages at production lines in Europe.</p><p>The chipmaker supplies 49 percent of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry, according to German financial daily Handelsblatt.</p><p>The European auto lobby ACEA warned last month that production would be seriously hit.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s chips, while widely used, are not &quot;unique&quot; in terms of technology and therefore &quot;easily substitutable&quot;, French parts maker OPmobility said.</p><p>However, suppliers must get the new products approved by automakers, which takes time.</p><p>Beijing suggested on Saturday that some shipments would resume.</p><p>Companies experiencing difficulties could contact the commerce ministry or local authorities, the Chinese spokesperson said.</p><p>ll-mya/mtp/pbt</p></div></article></div>",
