So he’s taking a dominant action to pull rather than stop and do a normal handshake,” Wood noted.</p><p>“He’s taking his left hand and arm and patting his back. There’s two symbols: Patting can be an affectionate move or it can show ‘I’m in charge’ ...

And it’s super rare for the shake to continue until reporters begin asking questions, which is what happened in Trump and Xi’s exchange.</p><p><strong>Life: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sports-betting-apps-addictive-psychology_n_68fa378be4b039323453fcc4?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why Sports Betting Apps Are So Addictive, According To Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Why Sports Betting Apps Are So Addictive, According To Experts</a></strong></p><p>“You see that Xi Jinping is ready for it to end. Part of what signals that nonverbally, he is leaning slightly away, both his shoulder and his head are leaning slightly away, he is orienting and responding face-on toward the journalist. Trump is slightly oriented toward Xi Jinping and just holding on,” Wood said. “A normal handshake is equal distance between two people. But when Trump pulls the hand and holds it in front of him, he’s showing, ‘I’m the one in charge, I have dominance, I’m going to win.’”</p><p>Wood, who studies greeting rituals and their symbolic significance, noted that the ritual of the handshake is traditionally meant to be a gesture of peace. Literally, it is meant to demonstrate you do not have a weapon in your hand or up your sleeve (that’s what the shaking is for). It’s meant to initiate the beginning of the “game” —&nbsp;and to acknowledge the equal footing of the two parties that are meeting.</p><p>“What Trump is signaling is the antithesis of the normal handshake, which is equality,” Wood notes. “It says, ‘We’re both safe here and we’re both equal here.’ Instead of the ritual, this is: ‘I want to show you that I’m going to win, that I have power and I’m not letting you go.’”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 814px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:129%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pose for a photo at a world leaders&#39; summit on ending the Gaza war in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, 2025. \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JcPfIQTWOdoGldz268cG9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNjA1/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/017986e5b2a92c1a556a44754d3b8429><noscript><img alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pose for a photo at a world leaders&#39; summit on ending the Gaza war in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, 2025. \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JcPfIQTWOdoGldz268cG9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNjA1/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/017986e5b2a92c1a556a44754d3b8429 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pose for a photo at a world leaders' summit on ending the Gaza war in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, 2025. <span class=\"copyright\">Suzanne Plunkett/Pool Photo via AP</span></figcaption></div></figure><h2><strong>The exchange ends on a less-than-dominant closer.</strong></h2><p>While his initial dynamic with Xi points to Trump maintaining his dominance, Wood notes that the handshake post-negotiation might tell a different story.</p><p><span>“After the negotiation, Trump does something that I’ve seen him do more often, he whispers in the ear. All of us want to know what he’s saying, but what that does symbolically is that they have a secret,” Wood said. “We don’t know what’s true, but symbolically, it looks to us that Trump is telling him something. That they have a secret between themselves.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wood noted that, having analyzed hundreds of these exchanges, this isn’t inherently weird — and often after the ritual of handshakes, leaders will part ways with a laugh or a joke or a clear moment where the tension has lifted and they can revert to being “themselves” again.</p><p><span>“Typically, it’s almost like two buddies, a laughing response,” Wood said, “while Trump, in that ending handshake, has a forced grin.”</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30, 2025, in Busan, South Korea. \" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3tq7VM5eWrgqkEMqt55N_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/83ed5f989866ad59fd86613af822251b><noscript><img alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30, 2025, in Busan, South Korea. \" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3tq7VM5eWrgqkEMqt55N_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/83ed5f989866ad59fd86613af822251b class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30, 2025, in Busan, South Korea. <span class=\"copyright\">Andrew Harnik via Getty Images</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>From there, the dominance display also starts to lose its power. One thing to know, Wood says, is that these sorts of televised meetings between leaders on the world stage are fairly formalized. There are people who brief all parties on protocol and where they are meant to go throughout the event. They also typically have time to practice or are given that explicit direction.</p><p>In Trump’s case, he ended up asking for directions and eventually walking Xi to his car.</p><p>“Usually, they will come down to that neutral point at the bottom of the stairs and go their separate ways,” Wood said. “It’s odd because it would symbolically show less power by Trump. To me, that was odd, and it symbolically looked like he had less power because he walked to the car and got lost; he just didn’t know where to go.”</p><p><span>“Again, because I’ve read so many of these: Usually they practice ahead of time or are told ahead of time and remember which way to go. So that’s odd. I guess it’s just important to say that’s not normal.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>And that whimper of an ending, despite all attempts at a bang, is notable from a nonverbal communication perspective, too.

The signing was witnessed by PM Wong, Mr Boric and Mr Luxon.</p><p>Singapore is proud to partner Chile and New Zealand in this endeavour, PM Wong said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“We may be three small countries, but we have a proven track record of pioneering innovative agreements together.”</p><p>The trio, along with Brunei, started the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership which evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).</p><p>They also started the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (Depa), he noted.</p><p>The CPTPP is a free trade agreement first signed in 2018 which now has 12 members including Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>The Depa, which facilitates digital trade, was signed in 2020. South Korea in 2024 joined as the fourth member, and China is among nine other economies keen to also do so.</p><p>Both pacts continue to receive interest from other aspiring economies – a sign of the value which others see in them, PM Wong said.</p><p>“Now, we are applying that same collaborative spirit to the green economy,” added PM Wong.</p><p>All three leaders spoke about their common goals in establishing the agreement.</p><p>Mr Boric said the three countries are like-minded and share common values. Chile has promoted various initiatives to foster the green economy and now 70 per cent of its electricity comes from cleaner sources, he noted.</p><p>“I am confident that this process will bring more opportunities and benefits to our people,” he added.</p><p>Mr Luxon also emphasised the shared approach the three countries share to global trade.</p><p>“We have worked together many times before in support of open and rules-based trade.”</p><p>He noted that it is fitting that negotiations launch this year as it is a significant year for bilateral relations between New Zealand and both Singapore and Chile.</p><p>Earlier in October, Singapore and New Zealand upgraded their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p><p>“The drive for this new agreement is our recognition that there is a global shift towards more resilient, durable, greener economies that is underway and to meet climate and environmental goals, and that does bring challenges, as well as significant economic opportunities for us all,” said Mr Luxon.</p><p>In a statement announcing the launch, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said this marks the culmination of a year of collaborative work by the three countries in the Joint Working Group on Trade and the Green Economy which was established in November 2024 at the sidelines of the Apec meet in Peru.</p><p>The working group considered proposals for a possible new instrument to enhance plurilateral cooperation on trade-related issues in the green economy, it added.</p><p>PM Wong added that he looks forward to a substantial outcome by the next Apec meeting.</p><p>He also encouraged officials from the three countries to look beyond conventional approaches, embrace new ideas and draw on private sector insights as they develop the Gepa.</p><p>“I am confident that by joining hands, we can turn trade into a force for good, catalysing economic growth while doing our part for the environment and for global climate action.”</p><p>PM Wong is in Gyeongju for the Apec meet till Nov 1. He will then travel to the capital Seoul for an official visit at the invitation of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, where they are slated to upgrade relations between the two countries to a strategic partnership.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-chile-and-new-zealand-launch-negotiations-for-a-new-green-trade-pact?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Janet Mills (D), who was “heavily recruited” by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to run for Senate. If Mills triumphs in the election, she will become the oldest freshman senator ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This is the new candidate, OK? She shouldn’t be running for Senate.

Santiago/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>The Justice Department is investigating whether leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.</p><p>In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.</p><p>It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.</p><p>Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.</p><p>One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.</p><p>The foundation said it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-90-million-finances-8a80cad199f54c0c4b9e74283d27366f\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:took in over $90 million in donations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">took in over $90 million in donations</a>, following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.</p><p>Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-finances-mansion-dc28cf47e3724c31d5791c90555b5b75\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a $6 million Los Angeles-area property;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a $6 million Los Angeles-area property</a> that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.</p><p>Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”</p><p>“We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/trayvon-martin\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trayvon Martin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Trayvon Martin</a> in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.</p><p>Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.</p><p>Leaders of the foundation <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-race-ethnicity-philanthropy-black-lives-matter-5bc4772e029da522036f8ad2a02990aa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022</a>, revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.</p><p>The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/federal-prosecutor-disqualified-los-angeles-trump-669a6ba5c4a5cd6368033f1e31fa931f\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:disqualified from several cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">disqualified from several cases</a> earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.</p><p>Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.</p><p>As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-87721d94bae126c54af917d296aa2563\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a BLM mural in Martinez, California;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a BLM mural in Martinez, California</a>.</p><p>At the time, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/george-floyd-black-lives-matter-murals-b8a13f73650f734cf1600335d5b2d702\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways</a> in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”</p><p>The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.</p><p>At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.</p><p>In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reportd. Many of those who live in Black River are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15-feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.</p><p>The heat and humidity are adding another layer of complexity to the recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.</p><p>In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”</p><p>Authorities have yet to reach the worst-affected areas. So far, four bodies have been found in St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday.</p><p>Three people also died during storm preparations, but the government has not provided a death toll since the hurricane battered the island on Tuesday.</p><p>Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjis.gov.jm%2Fgovernment-establishes-website-to-mobilise-support-after-hurricane-melissa-passes%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CSophie.Tanno%40cnn.com%7Ce02d55974552412c479c08de1790eda8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638974108682955445%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2xX0%2FDCf3bAzbbXFGQFYka4JMx54bA8xZeq3zAPFO8s%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">statement</a>.</p><p>Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government said.</p><p>Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a><noscript><img alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.</p><p>Schools around the Jamaican capital, Kingston, on the eastern side of the island, are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.</p><h3>‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba</h3><p>Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday.

The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.</p><p>Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><p>The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional development. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
