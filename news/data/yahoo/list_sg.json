Last December, she reported being <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/10/politics/nancy-mace-says-she-was-physically-accosted?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:“physically accosted”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">“physically accosted”</a> on Capitol grounds.</p><p>One officer said in their report: “Any other person in the airport acting and talking the way she did, our department would have been dispatch (sic) and we would have addressed the behavior.”</p><p>CNN has reached out to Mace’s office for comment. Mace’s Director of Operations Cameron Morabito <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/nancy-mace-airport-police-security.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:told The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">told The New York Times</a>, “Apparently, simply arriving at an airport now makes headlines if you’re leading the race for governor.”</p><p>“We are forced to take the congresswoman’s safety extremely seriously,” Morabito told the Times. “After the world watched Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the threats against her have only intensified. Our security procedures are based solely on legitimate safety concerns, and any attempt to politicize this reality is both dangerous and reckless.”</p><p>Mace also briefly spoke with the Times, saying she did complain to the airport because she is concerned about her safety given recent death threats against her. “We all get frustrated when it’s not taken seriously,” she told the outlet.</p><h3>Mace ran late, arrived in different vehicle</h3><p>Two Charleston County Aviation Authority police officers were informed at 6 a.m. they would need to escort Mace from the curb to her flight, according to an incident report filed by the officers. They were told she would arrive at 6:30 a.m. in a white BMW, the report says.</p><p>At 6:20 a.m., three officers went to the ticketing curb area and waited for her car, the report said. They were informed at around 6:35 a.m. she was running 15 minutes late and kept waiting for the car, they said, not seeing a white BMW.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Security video provided to CNN by the airport shows Mace arriving at a sidewalk entrance area at 6:50 a.m. in a dark gray sedan. No other people were visible in the video. Airport officials said they had no further comment.</p><p>A little before 7 a.m., officers were told Mace was waiting at the Transportation Security Administration known crewmember entrance, and the officers made their way over “in less than a minute,” the report said.</p><p>When officers met Mace to escort her, they said she was “very irate” and “began loudly cursing and making derogatory comments to us and about the department.”</p><p>“She repeatedly stated we were ‘f**king incompetent,’ and ‘this is no way to treat a f**king US Representative’,” one officer said in his report. “She also said we would never treat (US Sen.) Tim Scott like this.”</p><p>A different security video provided to CNN by the airport shows the TSA security checkpoint with Mace speaking with two airport officials at the known crewmember entrance. It appears an airport employee made a call to an unknown person, and approximately three minutes later the two officers arrived to escort Mace. It took about seven minutes from the time Mace appears at the known crewmember entrance and starts interacting with airport employees to when the escorting officers arrive, according to the video.</p><p>Mace allegedly continued cursing at the officers and into her phone while they walked with her to the gate, according to the account of one officer. After she boarded her flight, an airline employee and several other TSA agents said they were shocked and upset by her behavior, the officer said.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Data compiled by property analysts showed Sentosa Cove’s resale market softened in 2024 and 2025.</figcaption></div></figure><p>SINGAPORE – In July, a condominium unit at Marina Collection in Sentosa Cove was resold for $4.95 million, over 40 per cent below the price paid in 2008.</p><p>The seller had bought the 3,272 sq ft unit from the developer at $8.63 million.</p><p>While the latest data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed Singapore’s overall private residential prices continuing to rise, Sentosa Cove prices have moved the other way.</p><p>Data compiled by property analysts shows that Sentosa Cove’s resale market softened in 2024 and 2025, with more than half of the deals changing hands at a loss.</p><p>In 2024, about 59 per cent of landed and non-landed resale transactions in Sentosa Cove were loss-making. So far in 2025, this proportion rose to about 66 per cent, noted data from the research and market intelligence unit of property agency ERA Singapore.</p><p>Prices for non-landed homes in Sentosa Cove fell 18.7 per cent, from $2,125 per sq ft (psf) at the 2023 peak to about $1,792 psf in 2024 and $1,728 psf in the first nine months of 2025. Landed home prices on the island also dropped – by about 13.1 per cent, from $2,210 psf in 2023 to $1,842 psf in 2025, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) figures showed.</p><p>In comparison, overall median prices of resale condominium units in the Core Central Region (CCR) on the mainland rose from $2,081 psf in 2023 to $2,111 psf in 2024 and $2,186 psf from January to September 2025.</p><p>The URA’s release on Oct 24 showed that the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hdb-resale-price-growth-in-q3-near-5-year-low-private-home-prices-driven-by-new-launches\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:overall private residential property price index rose 0.9 per cent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">overall private residential property price index rose 0.9 per cent</a> from the second to the third quarter of 2025. Prices of landed properties increased by 1.4 per cent, while those of non-landed homes rose by 0.8 per cent.</p><p>The outlier performance underscores how the waterfront enclave, which has 2,160 private homes, remains driven by a niche, lifestyle-oriented buyer pool, said property analysts.</p><p>Asked why Sentosa Cove prices diverged from the mainland’s, property analysts pointed to the absence of new projects to set pricing benchmarks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>ERA Singapore’s key executive officer, Mr Eugene Lim, said the lack of fresh launches in Sentosa Cove has left the resale market without reference points, noting that the last Sentosa residential plot was sold in 2008.</p><p>“In contrast, mainland Singapore continues to see a steady stream of new sites through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme, which has helped support residential price growth amid rising land costs,” said Mr Lim.</p><p>He added that “a smaller supply of homes on Sentosa also meant that transaction volume is lower compared with the mainland”, reinforcing softer pricing.</p><p>Figures from URA show that sales volume islandwide rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2025 as developers ramped up launches to 4,191 private residential units, excluding executive condominiums. Developers sold 3,288 units islandwide from July to September, and 4,116 private residential units also changed hands in the resale market.</p><p>Currently, all transactions on Sentosa are resale units, and resale prices usually do not move as fast as new properties, noted Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist of property firm Realion (OrangeTee &amp; ETC) Group.</p><p>Demand is another factor, and foreign buyers traditionally play a significant role in supporting the Sentosa property market, she said.</p><p>Since the hike in additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) to 60 per cent in April 2023, “there has been a noticeable drop in the number of private homes bought by foreigners, which may have impacted properties in Sentosa Cove more than other areas”, added Ms Sun.</p><p>Citing URA caveats, she highlighted that the median price of resale condominium units in Sentosa Cove was also higher, at above $3 million in both 2024 and 2025, compared with the $1.6 million to $1.7 million islandwide.</p><p>Sentosa’s higher price quantum also narrows the buyer pool, while the relative lack of schools and everyday amenities make the location less compelling for many local families, said Ms Sun.</p><p>Sentosa Cove, which began as a residential zone in 2006, is the only enclave where foreigners can buy landed property, subject to approval.</p><p>Foreign buyers reportedly snapped up landed homes between 2009 and 2011, which led to a spike in prices. The median price psf for non-landed properties in Sentosa Cove rose to $2,110 in 2011.</p><p>In 2012, SC Global Developments’ Seven Palms set a record of $4,200 psf for a 99-year leasehold development when Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart paid $57 million for two units.</p><p>However, after the ABSD was introduced in December 2011 – applying to foreigners buying any residential property and Singaporeans buying their third and subsequent properties – to moderate demand for homes, the median price psf fell below $2,000 in 2012.</p><p>For almost the next decade, it hovered around $1,500 psf and $1,600 psf.</p><p>But the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a turnaround for Sentosa Cove homes. Prices for non-landed homes there started rising in 2021, hitting a median of $2,125 psf in 2023, supported by the sale at Cape Royale.</p><p>The upscale development, completed in 2013, hit the market only in 2022, nine years after the project was completed. The units were sold at between $2,000 psf and $2,300 psf. The developer held back units after sale prices fell following two rounds of property cooling measures in 2013.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 1207px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:97%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2wYGrWSq49HEb6wjsxOI3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjA3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c274a076c1663f0643787f36482bc507><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2wYGrWSq49HEb6wjsxOI3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMjA3/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c274a076c1663f0643787f36482bc507 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>With Cape Royale excluded, URA data shows the median psf price for a resale 99-year leasehold condo unit in Sentosa Cove to be $1,577.</p><p>In April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/prices-of-unsold-units-at-the-residences-at-w-singapore-sentosa-cove-slashed-by-nearly-half?ref=inline-article\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unsold units at The Residences at W Singapore Sentosa Cove were relaunched for sale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unsold units at The Residences at W Singapore Sentosa Cove were relaunched for sale</a> at more than 40 per cent off their initial 2010 launch price, with prices starting from $1,648 psf.</p><p>Mr Mohan Sandrasegeran, head of research and data analytics at real estate agency Singapore Realtors, said the adjusted price points could <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/waterfront-dream-sentosa-cove-condo-prices-hit-1648-psf-is-it-too-good-to-miss\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:open a window for buyers who had been waiting to enter the enclave.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">open a window for buyers who had been waiting to enter the enclave.</a></p><p>Mr Lim said set against CCR prices on the mainland, Sentosa offers relative value for buyers who prioritise waterfront living and space over connectivity and convenience.</p><p>Ms Sun said that in the longer term, limited stock on Sentosa may continue to appeal to investors looking for properties that are exclusive and rare.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sentosa-cove-property-prices-buck-mainland-uptrend-as-loss-making-deals-rise?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

None of them could say how they’re addressing air and land routes.”</p><p>Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said following the briefing on Thursday that administration officials confirmed that they do not necessarily know the individual identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it.</p><p>“They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” Jacobs said, adding that the administration did not want to detain or try survivors in court, “because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden.” The US military briefly held and then repatriated two survivors of one of its strikes earlier this month.</p><p>Military officials also told lawmakers on Thursday that the strikes were targeting cocaine, not fentanyl.</p><p>President Donald Trump told a collection of senior military brass assembled during an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/30/politics/hegseth-speech-culture-standards?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:unusual event in Virginia last month;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">unusual event in Virginia last month</a> that the strikes were primarily targeting fentanyl transporting ships.</p><p>“These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs too,” he said. “Every boat kills 25,000.”</p><p>Fentanyl killed more than double the number of Americans than cocaine did in 2023, according to <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:US government data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">US government data</a>. By Trump’s math, the campaign against alleged drug boats thus far should prevent roughly 375,000 deaths, or slightly more than the total population of Cleveland.</p><p>Jacobs said the briefers insisted that cocaine is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl but it was not a satisfactory answer for most of us.”</p><p>“None of them could say what they’re doing for fentanyl,” said the source familiar with the briefing. “Fentanyl is the real problem here, and they’re actually not addressing fentanyl in any of these operations.”</p><p>Democrats and Republicans also want a better explanation of the legal justification for the strikes, but military lawyers have been conspicuously absent from recent congressional briefings. The legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to brief lawmakers on Thursday but pulled out after it became clear that lawyers from the defense secretary’s office were given a “pass” at attending, sources told CNN. Without the lawyers there, Democrats said the briefers could not fully answer their questions about the legality of the strikes.</p><p>“They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said after the briefing. “They canceled at the last minute.”</p><p>Hegseth told reporters on Friday while traveling in Asia that he had engaged with Congress on a bipartisan basis about the strikes. But also on Friday, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, publicly released two letters they’d written to Hegseth over the last month seeking clarity on the operations, both of which have gone unanswered, the lawmakers said.</p><p>The letters requested the execute orders for the US military strikes on the boats, and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that CNN has reported the administration is leaning on to legally justify the strikes. Some Republican senators were shown the OLC memo by administration officials during a briefing on Wednesday, infuriating Democrats who were not invited to the briefing and have still not seen document.</p><p>Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional details.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

of the APEC (Asia-Pacific Cooperation Organisation) summit, held this year in the city of Gyeongju.</p><p>On Thursday, Xi met with Trump in the nearby city of Busan, with the two agreeing to dial down

summit in which he has framed Beijing as the defender of the multilateral order against &quot;hegemonism&quot;.</p><p>Xi met on Friday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the meet -- the first formal talks between the two countries&#39; leaders since 2017.</p><p>He told the Liberal leader he was determined to work together to get relations back on the &quot;right track&quot; and invited Carney to visit China.</p><p>Xi also sat down with Japan&#39;s premier Sanae Takaichi for the first time since she was appointed last month.</p><p>She said she told Xi that she wanted a &quot;strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between Japan and China&quot;.</p><p>But she told reporters that she also raised a number of thorny issues with the Chinese leader, saying that it was &quot;important for us to engage in direct, candid dialogue&quot;.</p><p>The Chinese leader now turns his attention to the South Korean President in what will be their first sit-down

federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/snap-benefits-november-judge-ruling?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:food stamp benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">food stamp benefits</a> for tens of millions of Americans in November.</p><p>The rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.</p><p>Hours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys “do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.”</p><p>“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115471065919157533\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:posted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">posted</a> on Truth Social Friday evening. “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”</p><p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges’ orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.</p><p>“There is no doubt that the … contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program’s operation.” US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. “The shutdown of the government through funding doesn’t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.”</p><p>During proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure some benefits could be distributed starting November 1.</p><p>McConnell’s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Though Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.</p><p>“This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds … to avoid any reductions,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26209680-boston-snap-ruling/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Talwani said in a 15-page order.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Talwani said in a 15-page order.</a></p><p>The Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.</p><p>Even with Trump’s directive and the judge’s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.</p><p>In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.</p><p>The Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.</p><p>As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.</p><p>The administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, “We’re looking at all the options.”</p><h3>Delayed payments</h3><p>States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.</p><p>Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.</p><p>Talwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.</p><p>“We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
