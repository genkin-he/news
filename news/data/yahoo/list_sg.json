website.</p><p>The image had been hosted in the department’s online repository of Epstein-related files uploaded in late January under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><p>At one point, the original page containing the photograph on Justice.gov returned an error message, though a version captured by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine on January 31, 2026, <a

that were flagged for nudity. The batch of thousands of images was pulled for review and is being uploaded with necessary redactions on a rolling basis. No files are being deleted.”</p><p>Lutnick has not commented on the image. The Commerce Department and Lutnick did not return repeated requests for comment from CNN. The White House did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Friday.</p><p>But several members of Congress — including at least one Republican on the House Oversight Committee — are pressing for answers about the temporary removal of the image.</p><p>On X <a href=\"https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/2027354498201509958\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on Thursday,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">on Thursday,</a> Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican member of the House Oversight Committee, wrote of the photo, “Howard Lutnick should take questions from the Oversight committee.”</p><p>On Friday, President Donald Trump told reporters today that Lutnick would testify to Congress about his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>“Howard would go in and say whatever he has to say,” Trump told CNN’s Kristen Holmes. “He’s a very innocent guy, he’s doing a good job.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Lutnick <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/11/politics/trump-epstein-files-lutnick-bondi-hearings-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:testified;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">testified</a> before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, during which he was pressed about his interactions with Epstein. Communications revealed in the latest release by the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/10/business/howard-lutnick-jeffrey-epstein-island?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:undercut;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">undercut</a> Lutnick’s previous claims of cutting off ties with Epstein in 2005, before Epstein was under investigation for and later convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>During his testimony, Lutnick said he had in fact visited Epstein’s private island for lunch with his family while on vacation in 2012.</p><p>Numerous other <a href=\"https://x.com/RepJimmyGomez/status/2027174014305607760\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:members;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">members</a> of Congress have also raised questions about the recently-surfaced photo.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu <a href=\"https://x.com/tedlieu/status/2027242949210169418\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said</a> the initial removal of the photo implied the Justice Department is involved in the “stupidest cover up in history.” Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, said the Justice Department <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2027138232761074014\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:should explain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">should explain</a> the decision-making behind the removal.</p><p>“I’m sure there’s a good reason for this. DOJ needs to tell Congress who pulled this file down so we can ask them,” Massie said.</p><p>A day earlier — following the House Oversight Committee’s deposition of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — the panel’s chairman, Rep. James Comer, said it is “very possible” that he could bring in Lutnick for questioning. It was not immediately clear whether Comer had seen the photograph at the time he made those remarks.</p><p>Rep. James Walkinshaw, a Democrat on the committee, also said Thursday Lutnick has been “lying to the country” about his relationship with Epstein and said the Commerce secretary should answer further questions about his past contact with Epstein.</p><p>On Friday morning, Rep. Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, accused Lutnick of “blatantly lying to the American people,” and said there was bipartisan support to bring Lutnick in for questioning.</p><p>“Quite frankly, he should resign or should be removed from office,” Garcia said during an appearance on “CNN Newsroom.”</p><p>During his previous testimony before the Senate committee, Lutnick was asked about messages suggesting he’d visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little Saint James.</p><p>“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,” Lutnick told a congressional committee. “We had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour, and we left with all of my children with my nannies and my wife… I don’t recall why we did it.”</p><p>But Lutnick denied that he and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-epstein-files-02-10-26?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Epstein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Epstein</a>, who met when they lived in neighboring houses in New York, had deeper ties.</p><p>“Of these millions and millions of documents, there may be 10 emails connecting me with him… over a 14-year period,” Lutnick told senators. “I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with that person.”</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8_s4Z2TQAE&amp;list=PLHY8kGYAi5RLEf4OwozbCSlyF3wJoqcOB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:an interview last year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">an interview last year</a> with the New York Post’s “Pod Force One”, Lutnick said that after a 2005 encounter at Epstein’s home, he grew uncomfortable and vowed that he would “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”</p><p>Lutnick said he saw a massage table in the middle of the home and that Epstein told him he got a massage “every day.”</p><p>“And then he like gets, like, weirdly, close to me and he says, ‘And the right kind of massage,’” Lutnick said.</p><p>Lutnick said that after that interaction, “I was never in the room with him socially for business or even philanthropy. If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/15/politics/howard-lutnick-epstein-ties-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previous CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previous CNN</a> review of the Epstein documents show numerous interactions between the two men, including an invitation from Lutnick to attend a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in 2015, a $50,000 donation from Epstein for a 2017 dinner honoring Lutnick, a 2013 business venture both invested in, and multiple emails in which Lutnick set up a 2012 visit to Epstein’s infamous Caribbean island with his wife, nannies and children.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Suffice it to say that it’s a threat. We can see that it’s possible.”</p><p>“Beyond just the nuclear program they possess these conventional weapons that are solely designed to attack America and attack Americans, if they so choose to do so. These things have to be addressed,” the top US diplomat said.</p><p>On the nuclear program, Rubio acknowledged that Iran is “not enriching right now,” but said “they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can.”</p><p>However, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff – one of two main US negotiators – claimed in an interview released last Saturday that Iran was “probably a week away from having industrial-grade bombmaking material.” That claim came despite the Trump administration’s repeated assertions that the US had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program in military strikes last year.</p><p>According to a source, intelligence shows that Iran is actively trying to build back its enrichment capability, including installing additional centrifuges, getting back online centrifuges that survived military strikes last year, and rebuilding facilities - many of which were damaged or destroyed - needed to weaponize the enriched uranium.</p><p>However, sources and experts say that work would take far longer than a week. And, according to a source, the work to build back the nuclear program is happening in places that are not likely to be impacted by military strikes.</p><p><em>CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

recent weeks as a power-sharing deal between rival generals, Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, has unravelled.</p><p>Turk said the situation had deteriorated further in January, with a 45-percent surge in rights violations and abuses compared to the previous month.</p><p>Last month alone, he said his office had documented that 189 civilians had been killed and many more wounded.</p><p>The UN high commissioner for human rights said he was &quot;horrified&quot; to learn of a massacre last weekend by government forces and allied militia on a village in Ayod County in Jonglei.</p><p>&quot;Witnesses told my colleagues that troops ordered residents to gather, and then opened fire on the crowd, killing 21 unarmed civilians including women and children,&quot; Turk said.</p><p>&quot;Military discipline appears to have collapsed&quot; on both sides of the conflict, with troops demonstrating &quot;a near-total disregard for civilian protection&quot;, he said.</p><p>- Pressure &#39;intensifying&#39; -</p><p>Turk said his team had recorded more than 5,100 people killed and wounded in the conflict in 2025 -- a 40-percent increase compared to 2024.</p><p>Denouncing what he said was rampant sexual violence, he said his team had documented &quot;a disturbing increase to 550 in the number of civilians abducted by opposition forces and their allies in 2025&quot;.</p><p>Turk voiced particular concern at hate speech and incitement to violence targeting entire communities and ethnic groups.</p><p>&quot;In one audio recording authenticated by the UN mission, a senior military official urged his forces to spare no lives, and to destroy civilian homes, livestock, and property,&quot; he told the council.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

shocks -- at a time when the UN&#39;s capacity to help is drying up due to funding cuts.</p><p>&quot;Without security, reliable services and sustained investment in infrastructure and recovery, South

to the Moon&#39;s surface by 2028.</p><p>That goal remains unchanged, but the US space agency is shifting its flight lineup to include a test mission before an eventual lunar landing to improve launch &quot;muscle memory,&quot; NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said.</p><p>That strategic revision comes amid repeated delays to the Artemis 2 mission, which was originally due to take off as early as February, but now will not launch before April.&nbsp;It is meant to see the first flyby of the Moon in more than half a century.</p><p>The changes mean that Artemis 3, which was meant to send astronauts to the Moon&#39;s surface, will now have the different test goal of &quot;rendezvous in low-Earth orbit&quot; of at least one lunar lander.</p><p>The next phase, Artemis 4, will aim for a lunar landing in early 2028. Isaacman said he hoped that mission could be followed relatively quickly by a second landing within the year.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re not necessarily committing to launching two missions in 2028,&quot; he told a briefing, &quot;but we want to have the opportunity to be able to do that.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Back to basics&#39; -</p><p>The NASA chief said speeding up the cadence of Artemis launches would allow for building more institutional knowledge in the model of the Apollo program, which originally put Americans on the Moon.</p><p>&quot;Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, through the shuttle program -- I don&#39;t think it would surprise many of the folks in the room that our average launch cadence was closer to three months throughout all those programs, not three years,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to start getting back to basics and moving in this direction.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Launching every three years, your skills atrophy, you lose muscle memory.&quot;</p><p>Earlier this week, in a setback for Artemis 2, NASA rolled back its towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft off the launchpad to investigate problems and make necessary repairs.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Space race&#39;? -</p><p>During his first term President Donald Trump announced he wanted Americans to once again set foot on the lunar surface.</p><p>NASA hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with its own effort, which is targeting 2030 at the latest for a first crewed mission.</p><p>China&#39;s uncrewed Chang&#39;e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026 for an exploration of the Moon&#39;s south pole, and testing of its crewed spacecraft Mengzhou is also set to go ahead this year.</p><p>Queried on the so-called &quot;space race,&quot; Isaacman said Friday that &quot;I think competition is good.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re here talking to you about what is a common-sense approach to achieve the objective, whether we had a great rival in the running or not.&quot;</p><p>But delays to space travel are not uncommon -- and could also stem from the progress of NASA&#39;s private partners.</p><p>SpaceX and Blue Origin, the respective space companies of dueling billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, are contracted to develop lunar landers used in Artemis.</p><p>Both companies posted praise of NASA&#39;s plans on social media Friday.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re all in!&quot; wrote Blue Origin on X, while SpaceX said it &quot;shares the same goal as NASA of returning to the Moon with a permanent presence as expeditiously and safely as possible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Frequent human exploration flights help establish a sustainable presence for humans in space,&quot; SpaceX said.</p><p>mdo/msp</p></div></article></div>",

they are set to receive as soon as Friday, according to a union official. The reduced pay comes as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/politics/department-homeland-security-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:partial government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">partial government shutdown</a> ends its second week with no resolution in sight.</p><p>The impasse could lead to staffing shortages and airport delays for some travelers, especially the longer TSA workers go without pay. (Air traffic controllers, however, are not affected by this partial shutdown.)</p><p>The agency is also making some changes to at least one trusted traveler program, temporarily halting the Global Entry program. Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/politics/shutdonw-tsa-precheck-global-entry-suspended-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">suspend the popular TSA PreCheck program</a> but then reversed that decision.</p><p>While some DHS workers are continuing to be paid, many other employees throughout the agency are also set to receive partial paychecks soon unless Congress acts. Most affected workers will only be paid for the second week of February in their next checks since the agency’s funding lapsed as of February 14.</p><p>These smaller paychecks will be the last many DHS employees receive until Congress comes to an agreement to fund DHS for part or all of the fiscal year, which ends September 30. The White House and Democrats have been negotiating reforms to the agency’s immigration enforcement operations after two US citizens were fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis in January. Senate Democrats are demanding changes before they’ll support appropriating more money for DHS.</p><p>Many TSA employees are already starting to struggle financially, concerned about how they’ll afford their March housing costs and day care, among other expenses, said Johnny Jones, secretary/treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees TSA Council 100, the union representing 46,000 uniformed TSA workers.</p><p>“You’re going to see TSA officers in food bank lines in a couple of days,” he said, adding that several colleagues have taken out payday loans.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In total, about 61,000 TSA employees must remain on the job at the nation’s more than 430 commercial airports during a shutdown. Many live paycheck to paycheck, Ha Nguyen McNeill, a senior official performing the duties of TSA administrator, said in written testimony for a House subcommittee hearing before the funding lapsed.</p><p>Overall, more than 90% of DHS’ 272,000 employees will continue working during a lapse, according to the agency’s September shutdown plan covering the first five days of an impasse. More than 93% of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection workers will remain on the job.</p><p>Only about 44,500 staffers will continue to be paid through other appropriations, according to the shutdown plan.</p><p>DHS has other resources to draw on, including a $165 billion infusion from last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which funneled $75 billion to ICE, alone, and $64 billion to CBP.</p><p>The president’s signature policy bill gives DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wide-ranging power to move money around to carry out the agency’s operations.</p><p>DHS is using funds from the package to pay nearly 58,000 CBP employees, including officers and border patrol enforcement personnel, according to an email sent this week by the National Treasury Employees Union, obtained by CNN.</p><p>Last fall, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/tsa-precheck-noem-dhs-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Noem;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Noem</a> said that 70,000 law enforcement personnel, including in CBP, ICE and other divisions, would receive their paychecks amid that shutdown.</p><p>Civilian Coast Guard workers will receive about half their paycheck on or around March 2, according to a FAQ posted by the division. Military Coast Guard members received a full paycheck on February 15, the FAQ said.</p><p>Noem said Coast Guard members would continue to be paid, according to a spokesperson for Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from New York, who had raised concerns with President Donald Trump last week. Military personnel are scheduled to get their next paycheck on Friday. (It’s unclear whether civilian employees will also continue to receive full paychecks.)</p><p>DHS referred questions on pay to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Federal employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends, according to a 2019 law.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Guthrie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Savannah Guthrie</a>, has stretched into a fourth, anguished week, with mounting pressure on investigators and a family grappling with uncertainty.</p><p>Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31, before she was <a

kidnapped;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">apparently kidnapped</a>, disappearing from her secluded home in Arizona’s Catalina Foothills without her phone — or critical medications.</p><p>The days since she vanished have been marked by disturbing twists: purported ransom notes demanding millions of dollars, an intensive investigation, emotional video pleas from Nancy Guthrie’s children begging for the return of their mother, and video of an armed, masked person tampering with the doorbell camera at her Tucson home.</p><h3>The latest on where things stand</h3><p>• <strong>Guthrie family offers a million dollars reward:</strong> After nearly a week of silence, Savannah Guthrie posted an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:emotional new

mother’s recovery.</p><p>• <strong>No leading theory:</strong> Authorities say they believe Nancy Guthrie was removed from the home against her will. But investigators still have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-15-26?post-id=cmlom18s200003b6rgicohos8&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:no leading theory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">no leading theory</a> about a motive, according to a source. They have not ruled out the possibility more than one person may have been involved, the sheriff said Friday.</p><p>• <strong>Doorbell footage from two dates: </strong>The masked person seen on the doorbell camera footage of Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home the morning she is believed to have been kidnapped was also recorded at her doorstep on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:another night;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">another night</a>, a source told CNN. FBI Director Kash Patel’s release of the image believed to be from a different night surprised local and federal investigators on the ground as they hoped to keep the detail confidential, another source said.</p><p>• <strong>DNA analysis:</strong> Investigators continue to run lab analysis on DNA found at Nancy Guthrie’s house, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Thursday. DNA on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-16-26?post-id=cmlp5jx3e00003b6r0fl2i78k&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:gloves;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gloves</a> found 2 miles from the home did not return any matches in the national database known as CODIS, and doesn’t match <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-savannah-missing-mom-02-13-26?post-id=cmllg8qzf000h356r0ur5bzje&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:DNA found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">DNA found</a> the house, either, Nanos <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-search-update-02-17-26?post-id=cmlqx582z00003b6py3nhtlrq&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said</a>.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>• Other evidence: </strong>Officials determine the man seen in doorbell video was carrying an Ozark backpack, the sheriff said, but are still trying to identify other items and where they might have been purchased. Teams of FBI and local law enforcement investigators are also reviewing “thousands of hours” of video obtained from the greater Tucson area, a law enforcement official familiar with the case told CNN.</p><p>• <strong>Family not suspects:</strong> Nancy Guthrie’s adult children and their spouses <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-news-updates-02-16-26?post-id=cmlpnlzve00003b6pljbq4hqp&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:are not suspects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">are not suspects</a> in her February 1 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/timeline-nancy-guthrie-search?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:disappearance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">disappearance</a>, the sheriff says, calling any suggestion otherwise “cruel.”</p><p>• <strong>Tip lines:</strong> If you have information that could help investigators, you can call 1-800-CALL-FBI or 520-351-4900. You can also submit information at <a href=\"https://tips.fbi.gov/home\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:tips.fbi.gov;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">tips.fbi.gov</a>.</p><h3>Timeline of key events</h3><h3>Friday, February 27</h3><p>Savannah Guthrie renewed her appeal for anyone with information on Nancy Guthrie’s whereabouts to submit tips to the FBI.</p><p>Guthrie made two sets of social media posts underscoring the family’s previous offer of $1 million for information leading to the recovery of her missing mother.</p><p>One of the posts – shared on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DVRL4CgjWWk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1674320580221182\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Facebook</a> – features a 36-second video clip of a “Today” show segment explaining how the FBI’s tip line works and how reward money can be claimed anonymously. In the caption, she writes “the reward can be paid in cash,” marking the first time she specified that on social media.</p><p>Friday’s second message – also shared to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DVRNXugDYWe/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/2075556946511485\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Facebook</a> – featured a truncated version of her video from three days earlier in which she announced the family’s $1 million reward offer.</p><p>The text of this post reads, in part: “Please bring her home. You can be anonymous.”</p><h3>Wednesday, February 25</h3><p>Several people were seen walking around Nancy Guthrie’s property Wednesday morning — the most activity CNN has seen at the residence in days.</p><p>Federal prosecutors, accompanied by FBI Special Agents, visited the home Wednesday, the US Attorney’s office in Phoenix confirmed Thursday.</p><p>“Federal prosecutors traditionally work with all levels of law enforcement and have done so throughout this investigation,” said Timothy Courchaine, US Attorney for the District of Arizona, adding they’ll “go anywhere, do anything, and persevere always to find her.”</p><h3>Tuesday, February 24</h3><p>Twenty-four days since her mother disappeared, Savannah Guthrie acknowledged Nancy “may already be gone.” In an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/23/us/nancy-guthrie-masked-suspect-video-details?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:emotional video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">emotional video</a>, the “Today” host said her family is “blowing on the embers of hope” and still believes their mother will come home. But, she acknowledged a difficult truth.</p><p>“She may already be gone,” Guthrie said. “She may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves … If that is what is to be, then we will accept it. But we need to know where she is.”</p><p>The family is offering a personal reward of up to $1 million for any information leading to Nancy’s recovery, Guthrie said. This action was taken after careful consultation and in coordination with law enforcement a source close to the family told CNN.</p><p>“Somebody knows. We are begging you to please come forward now,” she said.</p><p>She also acknowledged her family is not alone in suffering through the “uncertainty” of a missing loved one. So, she said, they are also donating $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p><p>“We are hoping that the attention that has been given to our mom and our family will extend to all the families like ours who are in need and need prayers and need support,” Guthrie said.</p><p>The family’s reward is in addition to the FBI’s $100,000 reward for information about Guthrie, the agency <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIPhoenix/status/2026296993211994352\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said Tuesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said Tuesday</a>. The announcement raises the total reward to up to $1.2 million for information on Guthrie’s disappearance.</p><p>The Guthries have continued to “stay in lockstep” with investigators, a source close to the family told CNN. The reward comes after investigative updates have appeared to slow as the search enters its fourth week.</p><p>In other developments, the FBI will be shifting its investigative command post from Tucson to Phoenix, FBI Phoenix Public Information Officer Kevin Smith told CNN Tuesday, while emphasizing that everyone who is working on the ground with the sheriff’s department will stay and it is not a reduction in resources.</p><h3>Monday, February 23</h3><p>The masked person seen on the doorbell camera footage of Guthrie’s home the morning she is believed to have been kidnapped was also at her doorstep on another night, a source tells CNN.</p><p>The photos and video of the masked person on Guthrie’s doorstep — released <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2021285842044494279\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:by the FBI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">by the FBI</a> on February 10 — were taken on two different days, rather than just on February 1, when authorities believe she was abducted, the source says.

The suspect is described as male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall and having an average build, according to the FBI.</p><p>Local and federal investigators on the ground in Arizona searching for Nancy Guthrie were surprised by video and photos posted on social media earlier this month by the head of the FBI depicting her suspected abductor, another law enforcement source involved in the investigation told CNN.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel posted on February 10 chilling video of a man at Guthrie’s front door before her disappearance, including a follow-up post announcing and releasing “additional recovered images from the same camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.”</p><p>But investigators in Tucson believed one of the images Patel posted — showing the man without a backpack or gun — was not actually from the date of her abduction, but possibly from weeks before as the man appeared to surveil her home, the source said.</p><p>Authorities had hoped to keep specific details of that image confidential while they worked to identify the suspect and a motive, the source said. Local investigators were also puzzled by the fact FBI headquarters insisted the new imagery would be tweeted from Patel’s own X account rather the general FBI account.</p><p>“It would have been nice to know what (FBI) headquarters was planning to release,” the source said.</p><p>The FBI has not responded to CNN’s request for clarity on Patel’s social media post.</p><p>Residents in Guthrie’s neighborhood were previously asked by the sheriff’s department <a href=\"https://neighbors.ring.com/n/ZyP8or0spO\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:to submit video as far back as January 1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">to submit video as far back as January 1</a>, but the request specifically focused<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/nancy-guthrie-savannah-missing-mom-02-12-26?post-id=cmljf96md00003b6p1bcyd18p&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on two dates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> on two dates</a>.

Reviewing the “thousands of hours” of footage is a painstaking process and often involves slowing down video frame by frame to look for anything of interest, the source adds.</p><p>Officials on both sides of the US-Mexico border were also told to be on the lookout for clues that might assist in the case as part of standard investigative procedures, according to a law enforcement official familiar. Investigators briefed US Border Patrol agents and Mexican law enforcement authorities, the official says.</p><p>Due to the proximity of Tucson to the border, the official says, both US and Mexican border officials are aware of doorbell camera footage showing a suspect possibly responsible for Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance.</p><p>It is not uncommon for US authorities to brief their Mexican counterparts out of an abundance of caution about cases involving fugitives who may abscond from the United States.</p><p>Madres Buscadoras de Sonora (Searching Mothers of Sonora) — a Mexican nonprofit organization of women activists comprised of volunteers, mothers and wives — tells CNN it was contacted by a member of the Guthrie family to help with the search.

We do have a number ofleads coming in.”</p><h3>Saturday, January 31</h3><p>Nancy Guthrie joins her family for dinner and game night Saturday evening, Ubering to her older daughter Annie Guthrie’s nearby home around 5:32 p.m. Hours later, her son-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, drives her home. Nancy Guthrie’s garage door opens at approximately 9:48 p.m. and closes at 9:50 p.m.</p><p>“It is that time we assume that Nancy’s home and probably going to bed,” Nanos would say at a news conference a few days after her disappearance.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional information. </em></p><p>CNN’s Norma Galeana contributed reporting from Tucson.

Brookfield Asset Management&#39;s new AI infrastructure company Radiant has been valued at $1.3 billion after merging with London-based cloud computing firm Ori Industries, according to three people ‌with knowledge of the matter and a document seen by Reuters.</p><p>Radiant, a new company the Canadian asset ‌manager created to provide on-demand access to <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:artificial intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">artificial intelligence</a> chips, said it had combined with Ori in a deal announced on Tuesday without ​disclosing any financial terms.</p><p>All of Ori&#39;s existing investors have rolled their stakes into Radiant, the sources said, adding that Brookfield injected fresh capital into the new company. Reuters could not determine how much of the valuation reflected Ori&#39;s contribution.</p><p>The valuation was established earlier this month, according to the document and one of the people. Reuters could not determine if it had ‌changed since then.</p><p>Brookfield and Ori declined ⁠to comment.</p><p>The sources declined to be identified because the terms were not made public.</p><p>RACE TO BUILD AI INFRASTRUCTURE</p><p>Companies House filings show that Ori had 42.5 million pounds ($57.2 million) in total ⁠assets less current liabilities at the end of 2024. Total debt was 11.3 million pounds from 4.4 million pounds a year earlier, according to its filed accounts.</p><p>The deal comes as investors race to build the data-centre, power and chip infrastructure needed for ​advanced ​AI, amid a shortage of high-performance compute capacity.</p><p>Mahdi Yahya, the ​founder of Ori, a startup backed by Saudi ‌Aramco&#39;s venture arm, will now be president of Radiant.</p><p>&quot;For more than seven years we have been designing software to support AI infrastructure at scale, and it was clear Brookfield was the right partner,&quot; he said in a statement on Tuesday. &quot;Through Radiant we can help address the supply-demand imbalance that has defined AI since 2023.&quot;</p><p>Vishal Padiyar, executive chair of Radiant, said the company blends infrastructure and software to support governments and major enterprises, aiming to lower computing costs ‌and improve performance at scale.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Radiant is one of the first projects ​backed by Brookfield&#39;s AI infrastructure fund, which is seeking $10 billion in ​investor commitments and aims to scale to as ​much as $100 billion through co-investment and financing.</p><p>The fund includes up to $5 billion earmarked for Bloom Energy ‌to install up to 1 gigawatt of behind-the-meter power ​solutions for data centres and ​AI factories, while chipmaker <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nvidia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nvidia</a> contributed to the fund&#39;s initial capital and will supply chips to Radiant.</p><p>Britain is ramping up data-centre construction and plans to expand national computing capacity 20-fold by 2030 as data ​centres are classed as critical infrastructure.</p><p>Global players ‌such as Google and <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/microsoft/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Microsoft;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Microsoft</a> have pledged multi-billion-pound investments to the sector in the UK, alongside ​up to 2 billion pounds ($2.70 billion) in public funding under the UK&#39;s Compute Roadmap.</p><p>($1 = 0.7403 pounds)</p><p>(Reporting ​by Sam Tabahriti; Editing by Anousha Sakoui and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)</p></div></article></div>",

said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Goodman said</a>.</p><p>The lawyer continued, “If [Trump] passes this kind of executive order, I imagine within hours there will be people who have already developed their litigation strategy to counter it, because it’s being broadcast by him and his team, or at least by this group with The Washington Post.”</p><p>The Post warned that Trump would gain “extraordinary” new powers over the voting process if he declares a national emergency under the guise of protecting elections from outside interference, which Goodman said itself would be “election interference on steroids.”</p><p>“OutFront” host Erin Burnett noted that the draft order curiously doesn’t mention Russia or its efforts to interfere in the 2016 election that Trump went on to win, despite later reports from a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee <a

saying that China would or wouldn’t do it, but I just am making the point here that bipartisan Congress acknowledged that Russia did interfere, and they’re not mentioning that,” she said. “So … the

He noted that the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-elections-executive-order_n_67e31694e4b0d01fd4f9a15b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:has “tested this” before;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">has “tested this” before</a>, only for the U.S. legal system to thwart him.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“So he passed an executive order, middle of last year,” said Goodman. “And in fact, that order was then contested in court and so far has lost. He is now appealing it, but it’s losing on the same idea that there’s no presidential control over state and local elections.”</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-split-over-election-lawsuits_n_68e6cb16e4b0d98d3e535e47?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Supreme Court Seems Open To Giving Election Lawsuits A Boost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Supreme Court Seems Open To Giving Election Lawsuits A Boost</a></strong></p><p>That particular order <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-elections-executive-order_n_67e31694e4b0d01fd4f9a15b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:would require proof of U.S. citizenship to vote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">would require proof of U.S. citizenship to vote</a>, bar states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day and direct the Justice Department to prosecute what the Trump administration considers election crimes.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/2018384723244904793?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:openly stated earlier this month;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">openly stated earlier this month</a> that “Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” He doubled down during his State of the Union address Tuesday, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fmieoSTI_yY?t=5690\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:claiming Democrats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">claiming Democrats</a> “want to cheat” in upcoming elections and warning that “we’re going to stop it.”</p><p>Goodman also pointed to a particular roadblock the Trump administration faces in seizing control of U.S. elections.</p><p>“It’s madcap in a certain sense of how extraordinary the idea is,” he told Burnett. “And that’s why it’s on steroids in a certain sense. And I think people that are involved in this machination might need to worry about their own criminal exposure, just to put it out there.”</p><p>Goodman continued, “There is a criminal statute that says that people should not engage in a conspiracy to deprive people of their rights. That’s 18 U.S.C. § 241. And it specifically says a conspiracy with respect to the right to exercise one’s vote. That’s what it’s about.”</p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/social-media-critics-rip-jd-vance-most-cartoonishly-evil-laugh_n_6995c563e4b0d22a8031d005?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Critics Rip JD Vance Over &#39;Most Cartoonishly Evil Laugh&#39; After Question About 2028 Election;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Critics Rip JD Vance Over &#39;Most Cartoonishly Evil Laugh&#39; After Question About 2028 Election</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-polls-election-2026_n_6990ccdee4b0d24cb0c4ba61?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Minnesota Held An Election In The Middle Of The ICE Surge.
