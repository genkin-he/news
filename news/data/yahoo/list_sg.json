Countries long held as exemplars of higher TFR like France and the Nordic countries are experiencing declines in their birth rates, she said.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=cf639ab0-a04c-5603-878e-39a6086ea120><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:177% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EtUS_q9HrM?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EtUS_q9HrM?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>In the region, the TFRs of Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are also on the downtrend, while in China, the number of deaths exceed births.</p><p>Said Ms Indranee: “The Government is wholly committed to addressing this issue head on and we will spare no effort to arrest and reverse this decline.”</p><p>But this cannot be the work of the Government alone, and all of society needs to play their part, she added.</p><p>She was responding to several MPs like Mr Shawn Loh (Jalan Besar GRC) and NCMP Andre Low who raised concerns and suggestions about the cost of childraising. Some including Mr David Hoe (Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC) asked for more childcare leave and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) called for better fertility health support.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Ms Indranee said the new workgroup will consult members of the public, businesses and the people sector, to develop concrete plans in the coming months.</p><p>It will build on current efforts, while cultivating positive mindsets about marriage and parenthood, work with employers, and engage the whole of society.</p><p>Feedback and suggestions will help shape the work group’s recommendations and guide the next phase of marriage and parenthood enhancements, she said.</p><p>While it is not about pushing a single “correct” path, Ms Indranee noted that two key mindset shifts are needed to create an environment where deeply personal decisions surrounding marriage and parenthood can be viewed positively rather than with fear and anxiety.</p><p>Individuals who were hesitant to have children often looked at parenthood through the lens of what they might lose, like being held back in their careers, the inability to pursue other life goals, and the loss of personal freedom, she said.</p><p>Those with children or intend to have them on the other hand, saw parenthood in terms of what they gained, like joy, fulfilment and personal growth.</p><p>While finding a life partner, getting married and starting a family are major milestones that take time, energy, and change, many Singaporean couples have shown that having a family and careers can co-exist alongside other life goals, Ms Indranee said.</p><p>“Ultimately it is a personal choice. But we need a mindset change, to encourage couples to consider a more balanced picture when exercising this choice.”</p><p>Another prevailing mindset that surfaced during engagements was the immense pressure couples put on themselves to be the “perfect parent”, she noted.</p><p>Ms Indranee said one young doctor felt guilty that he could not spend more time with his son because of his work schedule, and he felt that he was not being a good father.</p><p>Another young newly-wed woman was hesitant to have a child as she was not sure if she could provide the best possible resources for her child to succeed in life.</p><p>“Wanting more time to spend with your children or providing them with the right resources stem from good intentions. However, in hindsight, many parents reflected that parenthood was not about providing the best for their children or having all the answers from the start,” she said.</p><p>Rather, it was about being willing to learn, adapt and grow alongside their children, doing the best they can within their circumstances and relying on community support where possible, she added.</p><p>Many parents feel pressure to help their children excel academically, for fear that they may not succeed in life, she said. This largely stems from the fear that there is only a narrow gate to success.</p><p>These are real anxieties that the Government wants to help address, and the Ministry of Education has made progressive changes over the years to develop multiple pathways for children and reduce over-emphasis on academic results, she added.</p><p>These structural reforms will only work if cultural attitudes towards competition and success shift in tandem, and society must move away from viewing education in Singapore as a competition, but see it as an open highway with many lanes, Ms Indranee said.</p><p>To this end, the MOE will start a series of engagements to look at how to mitigate <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/inside-singapores-education-arms-race-stress-inequality-and-the-push-for-change\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the education “arms race”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the education “arms race”</a>, including by reducing the stakes of examinations.</p><p>The workgroup will also work with employers to foster family-friendly workplace cultures and practices, which make a big difference to parents, said Ms Indranee.</p><p>She cited the example of Mr Edmund Seah, a medical social worker, who took two weeks of paternity leave during his daughter’s first month to support his wife’s confinement. He later took the remaining two weeks and three weeks of shared parental leave during the child’s first year.</p><p>This flexibility allowed the 31-year-old to be present for his wife and baby when it mattered, she said. He paid it forward by covering his colleague’s workload when she went on maternity leave.</p><p>Mr Seah told The Straits Times he was concerned about having enough time for his family given the demands of his job, and had early conversations with his employer, St. Luke’s Hospital, to plan ahead for his leave.</p><p>Having a supportive employer has given him greater peace of mind, he said.</p><p>“I believe that when employees feel supported in important life transitions, they are more committed and willing to contribute meaningfully to their organisations,” he added.</p><p>Said Ms Indranee: “The latest TFR figures have not deterred us from our quest to boost marriage and parenthood. If anything, it underscores the urgency of the task before us, and it has made us even more determined to turn things around.”</p><p>The Government will redouble our efforts to address this existential challenge.”</p><p>Addressing Ms Hany Soh’s (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) clarification on the timeline of the work group’s engagements and recommendations, Ms Indranee said some measures could be implemented earlier while more complex policies could take longer.</p><p>“Time is of the essence. It’s an existential issue. We can’t afford to sit back and wait,” she said.</p><p>“In this term of Government, you can be assured that we will be preoccupied with trying to make sure that we have more Singaporean babies born.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-needs-to-reset-views-on-marriage-parenthood-new-work-group-to-study-issues-indranee?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

they’re increasingly concerned about his mental capacity as well.</p><p>The unease is not at the levels it was with Biden, who was 81 when he dropped out of the race, but it’s growing as an issue for the 79-year-old Trump.</p><p>In fact, multiple recent polls show a majority of Americans questioning it in one way or another. And even many Republicans seem to have concerns.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking poll came Tuesday, ahead of Trump’s first <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/what-to-watch-sotu-time?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:State of the Union address;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">State of the Union address</a> of his second term, which beat his own record for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/speech-time-length-trump-sotu-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the longest speech to Congress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the longest speech to Congress</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/most-americans-say-trump-is-growing-erratic-with-age-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Reuters-Ipsos poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Reuters-Ipsos poll</a> showed 61% of Americans agreed that Trump has “become erratic with age.” Even 30% of Republicans agreed with that sentiment.</p><p>The survey harks back to some surveys in Trump’s first term, when many Americans grew to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:question his mental acuity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">question his mental acuity</a>. But while the percentage of registered voters saying he wasn’t “mentally stable” approached 50% in Quinnipiac University polling following the attack on the US Capitol in 2021, it never crested a majority — much less hitting 61%. (“Erratic” is, of course, not the same as “unstable.” But they are along the same lines.)</p><p>The Reuters-Ipsos poll also showed a decrease in the percentage of Americans who say Trump is “mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” That number has dropped from <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-09/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Large%20Sample%20Poll%20%235%20Topline%2009%2020%202023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:54% in September 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">54% in September 2023</a> to 45% today.</p><p>But Trump — who often boasts about acing cognitive tests and who spoke for an hour and 47 minutes on Tuesday night — is still nowhere close to where Biden was; only around one-quarter of Americans said Biden was mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges in <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/only-michelle-obama-bests-trump-alternative-biden-2024\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:July 2024;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">July 2024</a>, the month he dropped out of the race.</p><p>Other polls echo these findings, including one from CNN last month.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>That survey showed the percentage saying Trump has the “stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president” <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26490187/cnn-poll-on-trump-at-one-year.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:declining from 53% in late 2023 to 46% today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">declining from 53% in late 2023 to 46% today</a>.</p><p>That 46% is still well clear of where Biden was in 2023 (between 25% and 32%).</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2026-02/2026-02-22%20ABC-Post-Ipsos%20Topline.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll</a> last week showed majorities said Trump didn’t have the mental sharpness (56%) or physical health (51%) it takes to serve effectively.</p><p>The former is up 13 points from May 2023, while the latter is up even more – by 23 points.</p><p>Those numbers aren’t where Biden was late in his presidency, when he was in the 60s on both measures. But the percentage who doubts Trump’s mental sharpness (56%) is actually similar to where Biden was at this point in his term.

The percentage of them who are “very confident” in Trump’s mental fitness has dropped from 75% to 66%. On physical fitness, he’s dropped from 65% to 55%.</p><p>So in both the Reuters and Pew polls, we’re seeing 3 in 10 people (or more) in Trump’s own base express some concern about this issue.</p><p>Again, Biden had worse numbers overall. By <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/24/voters-views-of-biden-and-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:April 2024;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">April 2024</a>, the percentage of voters saying they were “very confident” was only 21% for mental fitness and 15% for physical fitness. <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24131320/cnn-poll-on-2024.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN polling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN polling</a> showed as much as half of his base said Biden didn’t have the requisite stamina and sharpness.</p><p>But why might Trump’s numbers on these measures be worsening?</p><p>One explanation is that they’re simply falling alongside his popularity. As people sour on Trump overall, perhaps they’re more likely to view his often-strange public performances in a more negative light.</p><p>But we’re also seeing these concerns register even with some Americans who are more inclined to view Trump favorably. It’s certainly possible that his verbal stumbles — things like repeatedly mixing up Iceland and Greenland — are registering. It’s also possible that scrutiny of bruises on Trump’s hands and whether he’s fallen asleep during public events — as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/politics/health-trump-bruises-left-hand?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:White House’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">White House’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/03/politics/trump-health-disclosures-questions?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:slow disclosures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">slow disclosures</a> about his medical testing and his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/us/politics/trump-age-health.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:more limited;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">more limited</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/29/politics/public-schedule-trump-health-stamina?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:public schedule;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">public schedule</a> — are leading some people to raise more questions than they otherwise might.</p><p>Regardless, what’s clear is that the oldest president ever elected is now having to deal with this issue, just like the previous holder of that title did a few years ago.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

build-up in the Middle East in decades.</p><p>The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal.</p><p>The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador&#39;s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.</p><p>Oman&#39;s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi later confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides had expressed &quot;unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions&quot;.</p><p>Iran&#39;s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not &quot;at all&quot; seeking a nuclear weapon.</p><p>&quot;Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,&quot; President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><p>United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman said.</p><p>While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants

Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>Ahead of Thursday&#39;s talks, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran&#39;s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons &quot;a big, big problem&quot;.</p><p>He followed up by saying &quot;the president wants diplomatic solutions&quot;.</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump&#39;s threats &quot;seriously&quot;, saying the US president had a &quot;right&quot; to use military action.</p><p>&quot;You can&#39;t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,&quot; Vance told &quot;America&#39;s Newsroom&quot; on Fox News.</p><p>- &#39;People would suffer&#39; -</p><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them &quot;a historic opportunity&quot;, adding that a deal was &quot;within reach&quot;.</p><p>The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump&#39;s daughter Ivanka.</p><p>The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.</p><p>A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.</p><p>Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.</p><p>Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.</p><p>&quot;There would be famine and people would suffer a lot.

TCS announced 12,000 ‌job cuts last year, but has since denied ​to local media that the layoffs were AI-related.</p><p>Cognizant, ​which generates about 30% of its ​code through AI and aims to reach 50%, is not worried ‌about automation eliminating entry-level jobs. CEO ​Ravi Kumar S said ​during the company&#39;s earnings call earlier this month that it hired 25,000 fresh graduates in 2025, and expects to exceed that in 2026.</p><p>Almost all of Cognizant&#39;s ​clients have already tried ‌to work with AI agents, Hodjat said, but have acknowledged that they ​need us to deploy it within their systems for returns.</p><p>(Reporting by Haripriya ​Suresh in Mumbai; Editing by Janane Venkatraman)</p></div></article></div>",

Florida-registered speedboat near its shores, killing four people and wounding six.</p><p>The clash was a new source of tension with Washington as the communist-ruled nation endures intense US pressure following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Havana&#39;s interior ministry said people arrested after an exchange of gunfire with the boat claimed they &quot;intended to carry out an infiltration for the purposes of terrorism.&quot;</p><p>The ministry said assault rifles, handguns, Molotov cocktails and other military-style gear were found on the vessel and the 10 occupants were all Cubans living in the United States.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was seeking its own facts about the shooting and would &quot;respond accordingly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re not going to base our conclusions on what they&#39;ve (Cuba) told us, and I&#39;m very, very confident that we will know the full story of what happened here,&quot; Rubio told reporters while on a trip to the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis.</p><p>&quot;As we gather more information, then we&#39;ll be prepared to respond accordingly,&quot; he said.</p><p>The attorney general of Florida, which lies just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Cuba across the Florida Straits, ordered an investigation into the killings.</p><p>The Cuban interior ministry earlier said the coast guard encountered the &quot;illegal&quot; US vessel, whose registration number it gave as FL7726SH, one nautical mile from Cayo Falcones island off Cuba&#39;s northern coast.</p><p>As the coast guard vessel approached, &quot;shots were fired from the illegal speedboat,&quot; injuring the commander of the Cuban vessel, the ministry said.</p><p>&quot;As a result of the clash, at the time of this report, on the foreign side, four aggressors were killed and six others were wounded,&quot; the ministry said, adding that the injured were evacuated and received medical assistance.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story

It said most of the 10 had records in Cuba for &quot;criminal and violent activity.&quot;</p><p>A man sent from the United States to take part in this operation was arrested on Cuban soil and confessed, it added.</p><p>The Cuban government frequently reports incursions by speedboats from the United States into its territorial waters.</p><p>US lawmaker with Cuban roots, Carlos Gimenez, demanded an investigation into the deaths.</p><p>&quot;United States authorities must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents and establish exactly what occurred,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;The regime in Cuba must be relegated to the dustbin of history for its countless crimes against humanity.&quot;</p><p>- People-smuggling -</p><p>Incursion incidents are often related to people-smuggling to the United States or drug trafficking, and have included chases, shootouts and armed attacks on border guards.</p><p>Shortages of food and medicine and daily blackouts drove an exodus from the island in recent years, with many heading to southern Florida, which has received waves of Cuban migration since the 1960s.</p><p>Wednesday&#39;s shootings came as Washington softened a virtual oil siege of the island imposed by President Donald Trump in January after the US ouster of a top Cuba ally, Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela.</p><p>Before Maduro&#39;s ouster by US forces on January 3, Cuba had relied on Venezuela, once a major oil producer, for about half its fuel needs.</p><p>Faced with an outcry from Caribbean leaders, worried that starving 9.6 million Cubans of oil would cause the economy to collapse, Washington said it would allow shipments of Venezuelan oil for &quot;commercial and humanitarian use.&quot;</p><p>The announcement came during the summit of Caribbean nations attended by Rubio, a Cuban-American who has spent his career hoping to topple Havana&#39;s government.</p><p>The Treasury Department said the Venezuelan oil would need to go through private businesses and not the Cuban government or the military apparatus that controls much of the island&#39;s economy.</p><p>The US oil blockade in place for over a month has brought an already crumbling Cuban economy, which has been under a US trade embargo since shortly after Fidel Castro&#39;s 1959 revolution, to the brink.</p><p>Mexico on Tuesday dispatched two military vessels carrying nearly 2,200 tons of aid to the island -- its second aid shipment in under a month.</p><p>Canada also announced Can$8 million ($5.8 million) in aid on Wednesday.</p><p>lis-jb/cb/aha/dw/jfx/cms</p></div></article></div>",

Our economic growth, and correspondingly, our income growth will slow.</p><p>“And with fewer citizens, it will become increasingly difficult to meet our national security and defence needs.

Advanced technologies for earth observation, satellite communications and space asset management, as well as geospatial applications for urban planning, disaster management and environmental monitoring have been earmarked for growth in Singapore’s developing space sector.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said Singapore will continue to invest in these next-generation space capabilities.</p><p>“These are high-growth segments of the global space economy, and have the potential to generate economic value-add for Singapore and good jobs for Singaporeans in engineering, data science and geospatial analytics,” he said in a written parliamentary reply on Feb 26.</p><p>He was responding to questions from Mr Victor Lye (Ang Mo Kio GRC) on Singapore’s role in the global space economy, following an announcement that the Republic <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/spore-to-set-up-national-space-agency-on-april-1-to-develop-and-run-space-capabilities\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:will be setting up a national space agency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">will be setting up a national space agency</a> come April 1.</p><p>The upcoming National Space Agency of Singapore (NSAS) will spearhead Singapore’s efforts to fully harness the opportunities of the global space economy, which is projected to reach US$1.8 trillion (S$2.3 trillion) by 2035, up from over US$600 billion in 2023.</p><p>Mr Gan said Singapore’s strong foundations in aerospace, microelectronics, precision engineering and artificial intelligence will position the nation well in the rapidly expanding space economy.</p><p>At present, Singapore’s expertise lies in the building of small satellites that can cut through cloud cover to take snapshots of the earth, and in using quantum technology to ensure information sent from space – to support the climate and maritime sectors for example – cannot be hacked.</p><p>There are more than 70 companies and 2,000 professionals involved in activities from designing and making space parts to providing satellite-based services.</p><p>Also, Singapore has launched more than 30 satellites over the past two decades. ST Engineering, for one, co-owns three satellites with the Government to support both national and commercial needs, from tracking maritime developments to weather monitoring.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The newly announced NSAS will build on the work of Singapore’s existing space office called the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn).</p><p>A new operations centre will consolidate the retrieval and analysis of satellite images on behalf of government agencies. It will also explore launching more satellites to meet future national requirements and uses in the equatorial region.</p><p>NSAS will also enact laws in Singapore that will support the industry, while meeting high standards on space safety and the responsible management of space assets.</p><p>To Mr Lye’s question on the talent pipeline, Mr Gan said that space is an interdisciplinary field. Its talent needs are generally met by graduates trained in areas such as electrical and mechanical engineering, computer engineering, computer science and data science.</p><p>Courses allowing students to design and build satellite systems and space-related applications are offered by local universities. The NTU Satellite Research Centre, for one, has built and sent up 13 satellites for research purposes since 2011, and these projects have involved undergraduates and postgraduate students.</p><p>Space technology specialisation will also be offered by Ngee Ann Polytechnic for third-year engineering students from 2028.</p><p>Mid-career professionals with experience in aerospace, microelectronics, precision engineering and AI will also form an important part of the talent pipeline for the space sector, said Mr Gan.</p><p>Professionals with backgrounds in areas such as finance, maritime, aviation and sustainability possess expertise for companies developing satellite data and space applications, he added.</p><p>An existing <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/60m-top-up-to-boost-spore-space-tech-research-bringing-total-committed-to-over-200m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Space Technology Development Programme;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Space Technology Development Programme</a> of over $200 million – administered by OSTin, but to be undertaken by NSAS – supports the training and employment of scientists, and engineers in research and development projects such as remote sensing and satellite communications.</p><p>On international cooperation, Mr Gan said opportunities lie in the development of space governance, rules and norms, such as the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.</p><p>“Outer space is a global commons where international cooperation is essential,” he said, adding that Singapore is already an active participant in such discussions.</p><p>Singapore also has had decades of cooperation with Asean in the use of space tech to address common challenges in food security, environmental monitoring and disaster management, and will continue to build on these, he said.</p><p>In Parliament on Feb 26, Dr Choo Pei Ling (Chua Chu Kang GRC) had also asked about how Singapore’s space-based critical information infrastructure is secured.</p><p>Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Tan Kiat How said any potential disruptions to satellite services will have a limited impact, given that over 99 per cent of the country’s internet traffic is transmitted via submarine cables, terrestrial cables and radio networks.</p><p>But as cybersecurity threats to space systems are expected to evolve, the authorities will work closely with the sector to enhance the security and resilience of Singapore’s space assets, Mr Tan said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-to-invest-in-next-gen-space-tech-eyes-jobs-in-high-growth-sector-gan-kim-yong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
