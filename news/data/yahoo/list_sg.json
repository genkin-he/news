State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 24, 2026. - Nathan Howard/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>When President Donald Trump visited Fort Bragg, North Carolina, earlier this month, the commander of the elite Army Delta Force responsible for carrying out the operation to seize Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro made clear there was one man in particular who deserved the highest military honor: Chief Warrant Officer 5 Eric Slover.</p><p>Slover, an Army special operations pilot, was guiding his MH-47 helicopter to a landing in Caracas when the aircraft was “immediately” fired upon by multiple machine guns at close range, according to the citation that would eventually accompany that honor. The cockpit was hit by 15 armor-piercing rounds, four of which hit Slover in the leg.</p><p>Slover maintained control of the helicopter to ensure the safety of the Special Forces soldiers on board as they exited the aircraft to complete the mission.</p><p>The commander told Trump that Slover should receive the Medal of Honor for his actions, according to an official familiar with the matter. Trump was quickly convinced and signaled to the team he was going to do just that, two senior White House officials told CNN.</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Slover, who sustained serious injuries during the operation, stood stoically during the State of the Union address as the recognizable light blue ribbon of the Medal of Honor was secured around his neck, the medal gently placed in the center of the tie on his dress uniform.</p><p>The speed at which the Medal of Honor was approved is highly unusual. Approval for the award can take years due to the intensely bureaucratic process for consideration. There is also sometimes dispute about whether or not to award the medal, a senior White House official said, and in this case, “the president made the decision and the entire team worked together to execute.”</p><p>The award was expedited at the direction of Trump, who was eager to make the announcement at the State of the Union — an address his team had carefully crafted to include inspiring stories to engage the audience, the officials said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Two sources familiar with the situation said that all official paperwork and processes were followed for Slover’s medal, but at a much faster timeline, helped along by military leaders’ willingness to support it and make the recommendations in-person. One of the sources acknowledged the process was “blazing fast” but said verbal approvals and briefings pushed things along as the paperwork caught up. An Army spokesperson said Friday that the service is “incredibly proud” of Slover and also said that “all statutory requirements” for the award were followed.</p><p>A Trump official tasked with expediting the process for Slover worked furiously in the days following the president’s visit to Fort Bragg to rush the paperwork through, the senior White House officials said. The camera-ready moment in which Trump called for the medal to be given to Slover was written into the first draft of his speech, one of the officials said. However, it wasn’t clear until Tuesday, the day Trump was delivering his address, whether the White House could complete the process in time.</p><p>“The White House and the Pentagon were proud to work expeditiously at the President’s direction to ensure this great American hero received the award he most certainly deserves,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN.</p><p>Still, Slover had to agree to be featured in such a public event. The physical toll of the operation to seize Maduro has been significant; Trump said during the address that Slover was hit “very badly in the leg and hip” by armor-piercing rounds that “shred(ded) his leg.” While Slover stood tall while he was being honored, when Trump’s speech began moving on, Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, commander of Joint Special Operations Command, appeared to lean forward and help Slover sit back into a wheelchair sitting behind him.</p><p>The second source familiar with the situation said that his physical recovery pending, Slover wants to continue his career as an operational pilot, though it’s unclear if that will be possible, both physically and as those working with special operations typically take great lengths to avoid being publicly recognized. That calculus undoubtedly weighed on him as a soldier who has spent his career in the shadows, engaged in covert operations, but who was suddenly thrust under a national spotlight.</p><p>Slover is “incredibly humble and stoic,” the second source familiar said, and someone who “has never and would never have the expectation of getting this medal for his actions.” The fanfare, they said, is not something he has sought or, frankly, enjoys.</p><p>“In his eyes this is what he signed up to do,” the source said. “He’s honored to have received this, but this is just what he would have done whether there was a medal at the end or not.”</p><p>There have been discussions about holding another more private ceremony with Trump and Slover’s family and friends, who traditionally participate in events when a Medal of Honor is awarded, the second source familiar with the situation said. Trump also said Tuesday that 10 other soldiers from the mission will receive awards, though it’s unclear what those will be or when that ceremony would be held.</p><p>The White House is holding a Medal of Honor ceremony on Monday honoring service members from several conflicts, though the listed recipients do not include service members who participated in the recent Venezuela operation.</p><p>While details of Slover’s service are scarce, likely given the sensitive nature of the units he has been assigned to and his deployments, the awards he has received paint a picture of a challenging career.</p><p>Slover enlisted in the Army in 2005, and attended Warrant Officer Candidate School and flight school, becoming a Chinook pilot. Army warrant officers are considered the ultimate experts in their craft, and it’s rare for a soldier to make it to the rank of CW5 as Slover has; only three to four percent of warrant officers rise to that level, the Army <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/263117/afc_warrant_officer_achieves_cw5_rank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said in 2023</a>.</p><p>A list of his awards provided by Army Special Operations Command shows that he has received two Distinguished Flying Crosses — one with a valor device and one without — a highly prestigious medal given to service members for heroism in an aerial fight. The “V” for valor device denotes acts of heroism “above what is normally expected,” according to the medal’s criteria, “while engaged in direct combat with an enemy of the United States.”</p><p>Slover has also received the Bronze Star with one oak leaf cluster, a Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, and more.</p><p>On January 3, he was flying an MH-47 — the Special Operations variant of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter — during the operation in Venezuela, dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve.

that were flagged for nudity. The batch of thousands of images was pulled for review and is being uploaded with necessary redactions on a rolling basis. No files are being deleted.”</p><p>Lutnick has not commented on the image. The Commerce Department and Lutnick did not return repeated requests for comment from CNN. The White House did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Friday.</p><p>But several members of Congress — including at least one Republican on the House Oversight Committee — are pressing for answers about the temporary removal of the image.</p><p>On X <a href=\"https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/2027354498201509958\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:on Thursday,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">on Thursday,</a> Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican member of the House Oversight Committee, wrote of the photo, “Howard Lutnick should take questions from the Oversight committee.”</p><p>On Friday, President Donald Trump told reporters today that Lutnick would testify to Congress about his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>“Howard would go in and say whatever he has to say,” Trump told CNN’s Kristen Holmes. “He’s a very innocent guy, he’s doing a good job.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Lutnick <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/11/politics/trump-epstein-files-lutnick-bondi-hearings-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:testified;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">testified</a> before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, during which he was pressed about his interactions with Epstein.

Thomas Massie, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, said the Justice Department <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2027138232761074014\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:should explain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">should explain</a> the decision-making behind the removal.</p><p>“I’m sure there’s a good reason for this. DOJ needs to tell Congress who pulled this file down so we can ask them,” Massie said.</p><p>A day earlier — following the House Oversight Committee’s deposition of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — the panel’s chairman, Rep. James Comer, said it is “very possible” that he could bring in Lutnick for questioning. It was not immediately clear whether Comer had seen the photograph at the time he made those remarks.</p><p>Rep. James Walkinshaw, a Democrat on the committee, also said Thursday Lutnick has been “lying to the country” about his relationship with Epstein and said the Commerce secretary should answer further questions about his past contact with Epstein.</p><p>On Friday morning, Rep. Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, accused Lutnick of “blatantly lying to the American people,” and said there was bipartisan support to bring Lutnick in for questioning.</p><p>“Quite frankly, he should resign or should be removed from office,” Garcia said during an appearance on “CNN Newsroom.”</p><p>During his previous testimony before the Senate committee, Lutnick was asked about messages suggesting he’d visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little Saint James.</p><p>“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies,” Lutnick told a congressional committee. “We had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour, and we left with all of my children with my nannies and my wife… I don’t recall why we did it.”</p><p>But Lutnick denied that he and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-epstein-files-02-10-26?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Epstein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Epstein</a>, who met when they lived in neighboring houses in New York, had deeper ties.</p><p>“Of these millions and millions of documents, there may be 10 emails connecting me with him… over a 14-year period,” Lutnick told senators. “I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with that person.”</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8_s4Z2TQAE&amp;list=PLHY8kGYAi5RLEf4OwozbCSlyF3wJoqcOB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:an interview last year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">an interview last year</a> with the New York Post’s “Pod Force One”, Lutnick said that after a 2005 encounter at Epstein’s home, he grew uncomfortable and vowed that he would “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”</p><p>Lutnick said he saw a massage table in the middle of the home and that Epstein told him he got a massage “every day.”</p><p>“And then he like gets, like, weirdly, close to me and he says, ‘And the right kind of massage,’” Lutnick said.</p><p>Lutnick said that after that interaction, “I was never in the room with him socially for business or even philanthropy.

Suffice it to say that it’s a threat. We can see that it’s possible.”</p><p>“Beyond just the nuclear program they possess these conventional weapons that are solely designed to attack America and attack Americans, if they so choose to do so. These things have to be addressed,” the top US diplomat said.</p><p>On the nuclear program, Rubio acknowledged that Iran is “not enriching right now,” but said “they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can.”</p><p>However, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff – one of two main US negotiators – claimed in an interview released last Saturday that Iran was “probably a week away from having industrial-grade bombmaking material.” That claim came despite the Trump administration’s repeated assertions that the US had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program in military strikes last year.</p><p>According to a source, intelligence shows that Iran is actively trying to build back its enrichment capability, including installing additional centrifuges, getting back online centrifuges that survived military strikes last year, and rebuilding facilities - many of which were damaged or destroyed - needed to weaponize the enriched uranium.</p><p>However, sources and experts say that work would take far longer than a week. And, according to a source, the work to build back the nuclear program is happening in places that are not likely to be impacted by military strikes.</p><p><em>CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

peace agreement and prevent fragmentation and cycles of retaliation that could herald a return to all-out civil war,&quot; Volker Turk told the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>Violence has risen in recent weeks as a power-sharing deal between rival generals, Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, has unravelled.</p><p>Turk said the situation had deteriorated further in January, with a 45-percent surge in rights violations and abuses compared to the previous month.</p><p>Last month alone, he said his office had documented that 189 civilians had been killed and many more wounded.</p><p>The UN high commissioner for human rights said he was &quot;horrified&quot; to learn of a massacre last weekend by government forces and allied militia on a village in Ayod County in Jonglei.</p><p>&quot;Witnesses told my colleagues that troops ordered residents to gather, and then opened fire on the crowd, killing 21 unarmed civilians including women and children,&quot; Turk said.</p><p>&quot;Military discipline appears to have collapsed&quot; on both sides of the conflict, with troops demonstrating &quot;a near-total disregard for civilian protection&quot;, he said.</p><p>- Pressure &#39;intensifying&#39; -</p><p>Turk said his team had recorded more than 5,100 people killed and wounded in the conflict in 2025 -- a 40-percent increase compared to 2024.</p><p>Denouncing what he said was rampant sexual violence, he said his team had documented &quot;a disturbing increase to 550 in the number of civilians abducted by opposition forces and their allies in 2025&quot;.</p><p>Turk voiced particular concern at hate speech and incitement to violence targeting entire communities and ethnic groups.</p><p>&quot;In one audio recording authenticated by the UN mission, a senior military official urged his forces to spare no lives, and to destroy civilian homes, livestock, and property,&quot; he told the council.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

consequences,&quot; the International Organization for Migration&#39;s Ugochi Daniels said.</p><p>&quot;Without progress on the political track, humanitarian needs will only continue to escalate,&quot; she told reporters in Geneva, speaking from the capital Juba.</p><p>She said more than 250,000 people had been displaced over the past two months, which had &quot;hardly registered&quot; with the rest of the world.</p><p>&quot;Pressures are intensifying,&quot; Daniels said, the latest crisis coming on top of decades of protracted displacement, exacerbated by climate shocks -- at a time when the UN&#39;s capacity to help is drying up due to funding cuts.</p><p>&quot;Without security, reliable services and sustained investment in infrastructure and recovery, South
