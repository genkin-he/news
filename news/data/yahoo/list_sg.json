We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”</p><p>The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.</p><p>The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.</p><h3>Taranto to be sentenced</h3><p>When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.</p><p>Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.</p><p>Prosecutors are still seeking the original 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.</p><p>Taranto’s attorney has asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.</p><p>Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.</p><p><em>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

A Chinese spokesperson added, &quot;the Chinese side will work with the U.S. side to properly address issues related to TikTok.&quot;</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, did not immediately comment.</p><p>The fate of the app used by 170 million Americans has remained uncertain for more than 18 months after the U.S. Congress passed a law in 2024 that ordered TikTok&#39;s Chinese owners to sell the app&#39;s U.S. assets by January 2025.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order on September 25 declaring that the plan to sell TikTok&#39;s U.S. operations to a consortium of U.S. and global investors meets the national security requirements set out in the 2024 law and gave them 120 days to complete the transaction. He also delayed enforcement of the law until January 20, 2026.</p><p>Trump&#39;s order said the algorithm will be retrained and monitored by the U.S. company&#39;s security partners, and that operation of the algorithm will be under the control of the new joint venture.</p><p>The agreement on TikTok&#39;s U.S. operations includes the appointment by ByteDance of one of seven board members for the new entity, with Americans holding the other six seats.</p><p>ByteDance would hold less than 20% in TikTok U.S. to comply with requirements set out in the law that ordered it to be shut down by January 2025 if ByteDance did not sell its U.S. assets.</p><p>U.S. Representative John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, said this month that a licensing agreement for use of the TikTok algorithm, as part of the deal by ByteDance to sell U.S. assets of the short video app, would raise &quot;serious concerns.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Andrea Shalal, David Lawder and David Shepardson in Washington and Maiya Keidan in Toronto; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Susan Fenton and Matthew Lewis)</p></div></article></div>",

launch of a Minuteman III missile (Clayton WEAR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump has ignited a firestorm of controversy and confusion with his announcement that the United States will begin nuclear weapons testing.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear whether he was referring to testing weapons systems -- which the United States already does -- or actually conducting nuclear explosions, which only US arch-foe North Korea has carried out in the 21st century.</p><p>Below, AFP examines what Trump has said, the state of current US testing, and what it would take to resume explosive tests.</p><p>- What Trump said -</p><p>Trump said in a social media post that he had instructed the Defense Department &quot;to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis&quot; with Russia and China.</p><p>However, neither of those countries are confirmed to have carried out recent explosive testing, and it is the Department of Energy that is responsible for the US nuclear stockpile.</p><p>The president subsequently told journalists on Air Force One that &quot;they seem to all be doing nuclear testing,&quot; and that &quot;we halted it many years ago but with others doing testing I think it is appropriate we do also.&quot;</p><p>He offered no details on the nature of the testing he had ordered.</p><p>- Current US testing -</p><p>The United States conducted the world&#39;s first nuclear test in July 1945 and used two nuclear weapons against Japan near the end of WWII.</p><p>It has carried out more than 1,000 explosive nuclear tests in total -- most recently in 1992 with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>That year, Congress passed a temporary moratorium on underground nuclear tests unless a foreign state conducted one, which has since occurred. Washington had already agreed not to conduct tests in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater as part of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which it has been a party to since 1963.</p><p>The United States has also been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, but the Senate has yet to ratify it.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In the absence of explosive testing, the United States ensures its arsenal&#39;s reliability through the so-called Stockpile Stewardship Program, which includes &quot;a wide range of scientific activities, from modeling and simulation to subcritical nuclear experiments,&quot; according to the US National Nuclear Security Administration.</p><p>&quot;This program allows us to assess and certify the stockpile with extraordinary confidence,&quot; it says.</p><p>Washington also periodically tests its nuclear delivery systems such as intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p><p>The US military launched an unarmed Minuteman III missile earlier this year, with the Space Force saying at the time that the United States had carried out more than 300 similar tests overall.</p><p>- Resuming explosive testing -</p><p>The president has the authority to authorize explosive tests, and Washington&#39;s forces have &quot;the capability to resume testing within 24-36 months of a presidential decision to do so,&quot; the US Congressional Research Service says.</p><p>It notes that a 2012 study found that &quot;the response time for resuming underground explosive testing is driven more by compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations than by the technical testing requirements or the need to restore equipment and facilities.&quot;</p><p>Doreen Horschig, a fellow with the Project on Nuclear Issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the US National Nuclear Security Administration would be able to &quot;get the test site ready within six to 10 months for a very basic underground test.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The timeframe is much longer if you want to test new warheads and new capabilities,&quot; Horschig said.</p><p>But she also noted that there is likely to be political opposition to a resumption of testing &quot;from both sides of the political camps&quot; in the United States, while &quot;our allies (also) do not see a need for (a) return to testing.&quot;</p><p>wd/des</p></div></article></div>",

runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump landed back in the United States Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued right as Trump was going into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>And it came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>The blunt statement from Trump, who boasts frequently about being a &quot;peace&quot; president, left much unanswered.</p><p>Chiefly, it was unclear whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions -- something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Regardless, the statement amounted to unusual nuclear sabre rattling.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>None of that appeared to be true.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- that China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. &quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus responded that she would introduce legislation to &quot;put a stop&quot; to any move at restoring live weapons testing in her state.</p><p>And Senator Jacky Rosen, also a Nevada Democrat, said on X that Trump&#39;s statement &quot;directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees... who&#39;ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen &amp; is unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>burs-sms/gw/des</p></div></article></div>",

Despite his innocence, Williams spent more than a full day in jail.</p><p>The arrest of Williams and two other Detroit-area men was reported by Wired as among the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wrongful-arrests-ai-derailed-3-mens-lives/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:first cases in the nation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">first cases in the nation</a> to result in an arrest based on wrongful facial recognition. “All three men are fathers,” writer Khari Johnson reported, “and all three are Black.”</p><p>Williams sued the Detroit police for his wrongful arrest. As a result of the settlement from his case, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/detroit-police-can-no-longer-use-facial-recognition-results-as-the-sole-basis-for-arrests-204454537.html\" data-ylk=\"slk:the department in 2024 was prohibited;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the department in 2024 was prohibited</a> from using facial recognition as the sole basis for arrests. The American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, which represented Williams in the case,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/civil-rights-advocates-achieve-nations-strongest-police-department-policy-facial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:called the protections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">called the protections</a> “the nation’s strongest police department policies and practices constraining law enforcement’s use of” facial recognition technology.</p><p>The incident still upended Williams’s life. “The scariest part is that what happened to me could have happened to anyone,” he said in a press release, after the settlement. What happened to Williams could still happen to anyone, as surveillance continues to seep into our everyday lives.</p><p>It is within this environment that police have increasingly deployed facial recognition technology purportedly designed to help cops identify perpetrators. In New York City, for instance, the New York Police Department received nearly 10,000 requests for facial matching and <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/about/about-nypd/equipment-tech/facial-recognition.page\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:reports it positively identified;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">reports it positively identified</a> more than 2,500 “possible matches.”</p><p>An article, posted this past Tuesday from <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-and-cbp-agents-are-scanning-peoples-faces-on-the-street-to-verify-citizenship/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:404 Media, reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">404 Media, reported</a> officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were caught on video openly using smartphone facial recognition technology to verify people’s citizenship. The technology, 404 Media wrote, was deployed during “stops that seem to have little justification beyond the color of someone’s skin.”</p><p>Meka Egwuekwe is a software engineer who now runs a nonprofit teaching coding, AI, and tech to community members in Memphis, Tennessee. He recalled, in a phone call, working on a project for a criminal justice-related customer around 20 years ago and noticing, even then, the limitations of facial recognition in identifying faces.</p><p>“There are real communities that are over-policed and over-surveilled,” Egwuekwe says. “So, even if they got the accuracy right, there’s still a lot of policy that’s not right in terms of how it’s regulated and used.”</p><p>The criminal justice system doesn’t present the only facial recognition risk to vulnerable populations and people of color. Joy Buolamwini became a premier scholar in the tech privacy space when, while in graduate school, she realized facial recognition software couldn’t recognize her face unless she covered it with a white mask. Buolamwini eventually founded the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization dedicated to addressing prejudicial bias in technology and AI.</p><p>Faulty facial recognition has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:blocked students from taking exams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">blocked students from taking exams</a>, been used in federal <a href=\"https://stpp.fordschool.umich.edu/research/white-paper/surveillance-technology-public-housing-proliferation-consequences-and#:~:text=Surveillance%20Technology%20in%20Public%20Housing:%20Proliferation%2C%20Consequences%2C%20and%20Recommendations,-December%2012%2C%202024&amp;text=Public%20Housing%20Agencies%20are%20rapidly,protects%2C%20is%20available%20for%20policymakers.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:public housing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">public housing</a> complexes, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39827008/mlb-facial-recognition-admission-privacy-technology\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:during large-scale events;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">during large-scale events</a> like sporting games.</p><p>“This isn’t a Black problem,” Nkonde, who founded a nonprofit addressing algorithmic bias called AI for the People, says. “This issue is a society problem. It’s just that Black people are the canaries in the coal mine.” Even as the technology has advanced to more accurately identify darker skin tones, says Nkonde, the privacy dangers it presents remain.</p><p>Zenni Optical’s Lee found himself at the intersection of tech and optometry after he invented an online eye exam. Years later, Lee helped create and launch Zenni Optical’s new tech offering: <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=a495747e-2448-44f0-9624-eb221b7e3ea2&siteId=us-y4p&pageId=1p-autolink&contentUuid=ac6072e5-ed20-37a5-ba6c-e813b38e9774&featureId=text-link&merchantName=Zenni+Optical&linkText=infrared+defense+glasses&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy56ZW5uaW9wdGljYWwuY29tL2V5ZXFsZW56IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJhYzYwNzJlNS1lZDIwLTM3YTUtYmE2Yy1lODEzYjM4ZTk3NzQiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnplbm5pb3B0aWNhbC5jb20vZXllcWxlbnoifQ&signature=AQAAATgmhFwe1QV4RYxLSZpWnQb57nMaE_emwItG1FDq_APc&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zennioptical.com%2Feyeqlenz&spaceId=1197793589\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Zenni Optical;elmt:\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:infrared defense glasses;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Zenni Optical;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">infrared defense glasses</a> meant for all kinds of protection — including from unwanted tracking.

Zenni’s lenses block up to 80% of near-infrared light.</p><p>“So think of it almost as a shield on your eyes,” Lee says. “It’s just this added layer of protection.” Starting at under $60, the EyeQLenz glasses are intended, like Zenni’s entire offering, to be accessible to an inclusive swath of consumers.</p><p>Zenni Optical joins a small but growing group of accessible glasses makers exploring anti-surveillance technology, even as technological advances are increasing the ability and probability that you’re being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6pYBEYRRaE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:recorded and positively identified;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">recorded and positively identified</a>, yet remain unaware. <a href=\"https://www.reflectacles.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Reflectacles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Reflectacles</a>, launched in 2017, for instance, offers several models of privacy glasses ranging from about $50 for glasses clips to about $230 for the sold-out Ghost Miasma frames.&nbsp;<span>A 2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-privacy-wars-goggles-that-block-facial-recognition-technology-12751519/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Smithsonian magazine article;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Smithsonian magazine article</a>&nbsp;noted on the emergence of this new type of discreet wearable technology, “Camouflage Couture is all the rage.”</span>&nbsp;And researchers cited in a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507542/facial-recognition-glasses-trick-impersonate-fool\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:2016 article on The Verge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">2016 article on The Verge</a> made glasses that could trick AI into misidentifying their wearer.</p><p>Zenni wearers can see their tech working in real-time, Lee says, since the glasses often block a wearer from unlocking their earphones through facial recognition.</p><p>And while these tools are now essential, we have to ask ourselves how it’s come to this.

wobbled Thursday as traders digested a high-stakes meeting between the US and Chinese presidents, mixed company earnings and uncertainty over further US interest rate cuts.</p><p>US President Donald Trump described his meeting in South Korea with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- their first since 2019, during Trump&#39;s first term -- as &quot;amazing&quot;.</p><p>The two leaders agreed to calm the US-China trade war that has shaken global markets, with Washington cutting some tariffs and Beijing committing to keep supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>But the frenzy on stock markets that led to new records in the run-up to the meeting and earnings reports by tech giants faded.</p><p>Asia markets ended mostly lower, while in Europe both Frankfurt and London ended the day flat after wobbling in afternoon trading.</p><p>On Wall Street, the Dow rose but the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were both lower in early afternoon trading.</p><p>&quot;Doubts over the possible returns on investments planned for artificial general intelligence, the Fed&#39;s &#39;hawkish&#39; rate cut and President Trump&#39;s underwhelming trade deal with China have done little to boost sentiment,&quot; said David Morrison, senior market analyst&nbsp;at financial services provider&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Nation.</p><p>Big US tech companies were in focus again Thursday, with investors reacting to earnings reports from Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft released after Wall Street closed on Wednesday.</p><p>Shares in Meta dove around 10 percent&nbsp;after third-quarter profits missed analysts&#39; expectations.</p><p>Profits sank 83 percent to $2.7 billion following a roughly $16-billion hit from a one-time accounting shift due to a US fiscal overhaul legislation favoured by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Microsoft shares shed 2.7 percent and shares in Google-parent Alphabet rose 4.6 percent.</p><p>Microsoft reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results but questions arose about the pace of AI monetisation.</p><p>&quot;These latest results highlight the business models of the big technology firms are becoming more capital intensive, as they build out their&nbsp;AI&nbsp;capabilities,&quot; said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He added, however, that if AI fails to deliver revenue streams, &quot;the effect on share prices could be brutal.&quot;</p><p>However Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada said that &quot;unless there&#39;s a significant negative surprise from the remaining tech giants yet to report, equities could well have further room to climb.&quot;</p><p>Amazon and Apple report after US markets close on Thursday.</p><p>Shares in Nvidia gave up 1.6 percent a day after it became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value. The company reports results of its third quarter, which ended this week, on November 19.</p><p>Seoul&#39;s stock market got a lift from tech giant Samsung Electronics posting a 32-percent rise in on-year profits for the third quarter, driven by AI-fuelled market demand for memory chips.</p><p>The European Central Bank held interest rates steady, as expected, as inflation hovers around its target and the eurozone economy holds up.</p><p>Data on Thursday showed the eurozone economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>The Bank of Japan also held interest rates steady on Thursday, sending the yen higher, after the US Federal Reserve delivered a second quarter-point rate cut.</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell&#39;s announcement, however, cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar on Wednesday.</p><p>Shares in auto giant Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Fiat and Peugeot,&nbsp;sank&nbsp;over eight percent despite rising sales as the group said it expected to incur charges in the second half of the year.</p><p>- Key figures at around 1630 GMT -</p><p>New York - Dow:&nbsp;UP 0.5 percent at 47,856.70 points</p><p>New York - S&amp;P 500:&nbsp;DOWN 0.3 percent at 6,868.95</p><p>New York - Nasdaq Composite:&nbsp;DOWN 0.8 percent at 23,758.70</p><p>London - FTSE 100:&nbsp;FLAT at 9,760.06&nbsp;(close)</p><p>Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.5 percent at 8,157.29 (close)</p><p>Frankfurt - DAX: FLAT&nbsp;at 24,118.89 (close)</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225:&nbsp;FLAT at 51,325.61 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index:&nbsp;DOWN 0.2 percent at 26,282.69 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite:&nbsp;DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,986.90 (close)</p><p>Euro/dollar:&nbsp;DOWN at $1.1566 from $1.1595 on Wednesday</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN&nbsp;at $1.3146 from $1.3187</p><p>Dollar/yen: UP at 154.11 yen from 152.82 yen</p><p>Euro/pound:&nbsp;UP at 87.99 from 87.94 pence</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude:&nbsp;DOWN less than 0.1 percent at $64.29 per barrel</p><p>West Texas Intermediate:&nbsp;UP less than 0.1 percent at $60.53 per barrel</p><p>burs-rl/rlp</p></div></article></div>",
