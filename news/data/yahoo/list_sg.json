El-Fasher, with the United Nations demanding an investigation Friday into the &quot;horrendous accounts&quot; of atrocities emerging from the city.</p><p>At war with the army since April 2023, the RSF seized El-Fasher on Sunday, dislodging the army&#39;s last stronghold in the western Darfur region after an 18-month siege marked by bombardment and starvation.</p><p>Survivors who reached the nearby town of Tawila told AFP of mass killings, children shot before their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled.</p><p>The RSF said late Thursday it had detained several men accused of &quot;violations... during the liberation&quot; of El-Fasher, including one known as Abu Lulu who appeared in multiple TikTok videos committing summary executions.</p><p>In one clip verified by AFP, he is seen shooting unarmed men at close range. Another shows him standing among fighters celebrating near dozens of bodies and burnt vehicles.</p><p>The RSF released footage appearing to show Abu Lulu behind bars in what they claimed to be a North Darfur prison.</p><p>It pledged to ensure &quot;military discipline during wartime&quot;, and promised a fair trial for those detained.</p><p>Since El-Fasher&#39;s fall, videos circulating online have purportedly shown men in RSF uniforms carrying out summary executions around the city, which has been cut off from all communications.</p><p>Emtithal Mahmoud, a US-based Sudanese poet from El-Fasher, told AFP she recognised her cousin, Nadifa, in a video shared by RSF accounts, lying dead on the ground.</p><p>The UN said the death toll could reach the hundreds, while army allies have accused the RSF of killing over 2,000 civilians.</p><p>- &#39;Horror is continuing&#39; -</p><p>On Friday, the United Nations voiced alarm at emerging details of executions, gang rapes and abductions in El-Fasher.</p><p>&quot;We have received horrendous accounts of summary executions, mass killings, rapes, attacks against humanitarian workers, looting, abductions and forced displacement,&quot; said UN rights office spokesman Seif Magango.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Magango called for &quot;independent, prompt, transparent and thorough investigations&quot; into all alleged breaches of international law.</p><p>The World Health Organization, meanwhile, said it had verified that at least 460 patients and others were killed Tuesday in attacks on the Saudi Maternity Hospital -- one of the last still functioning in El-Fasher.</p><p>On Thursday, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the Security Council that &quot;the horror is continuing&quot; in El-Fasher, and questioned the RSF&#39;s commitment to investigating violations amid the &quot;appalling news&quot; from North Darfur.</p><p>RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo had earlier vowed accountability for &quot;anyone who has made a mistake&quot;, while an RSF-led coalition maintained many incriminating videos were &quot;fabricated&quot; by the army.</p><p>Satellite imagery analysed by Yale&#39;s Humanitarian Research Lab showed clusters in the city &quot;consistent with adult human bodies&quot;, and discoloration that may indicate &quot;pools of blood&quot;, its director told AFP.</p><p>Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair said she was sceptical that the purported arrests would bring an end to the violence.</p><p>&quot;We expect these atrocities to continue, particularly against non-Arab groups,&quot; she told AFP, citing communities such as the Zaghawa, Fur, Berti and Masalit in Darfur.</p><p>In 2023, the RSF -- descended from the Janjaweed Arab militias accused of genocide in Darfur two decades ago -- was blamed for massacres against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur capital El-Geneina, killing up to 15,000 people.</p><p>&quot;Overall, these patterns reflect a disturbing repetition of ethnic tensions from 20 years ago, now compounded by disputes over resource control and political power in the country,&quot; Khair said.</p><p>More than 62,000 people have fled El-Fasher between Sunday and Wednesday, according to the UN&#39;s migration agency, while the fate of tens of thousands of civilians still trapped in the city remains unknown.</p><p>- Bloodshed in Kordofan -</p><p>Fletcher warned that the bloodshed was spreading beyond Darfur, with atrocities reported in the neighbouring Kordofan region.</p><p>According to UN figures, between Sunday and Wednesday more than 35,000 people fled five localities in North Kordofan state, including Bara, which lies north of state capital El-Obeid on a key route to Darfur and which was overrun by paramilitaries on Saturday.</p><p>Martha Pobee, the assistant UN secretary-general for Africa, highlighted &quot;reports of large-scale atrocities perpetrated&quot; by the RSF in Bara, including &quot;ethnically motivated&quot; reprisals.</p><p>At least 50 civilians were killed there in recent days, both in fighting and executions, including five Red Crescent volunteers, according to the UN.</p><p>Kordofan is &quot;clearly going to be the next area of military escalation&quot;, analyst Khair said.</p><p>The RSF Thursday accused the army of launching a drone attack on a school in eastern North Kordofan, claiming dozens of students and teachers were killed or injured -- an allegation the army denied.</p><p>AFP could not independently verify the attack.</p><p>Both the army and the RSF have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict.</p><p>The US has previously determined the RSF committed genocide in Darfur.</p><p>El-Fasher&#39;s fall to the RSF gave it full control over all five state capitals in Darfur, effectively splitting Sudan along an east-west axis.

Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">President Donald Trump</a> finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it.</p><p>Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t.</p><p>Trump late Thursday night urged Republicans to end the shutdown by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:invoking the so-called “nuclear option”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">invoking the so-called “nuclear option”</a> — that is, getting rid of the filibuster and 60-vote threshold in the Senate. This would allow Republicans to pass things on party-line votes in the GOP-controlled Senate.</p><p>“BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it.</p><p>So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president.</p><p>But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend.</p><p>The reason it’s unhelpful in this case is that it legitimizes Democrats’ talking point that Republicans could end this shutdown any time they want to. And that could make it harder for Republicans to shake the blame they’ve been saddled with.</p><p>It’s been pretty remarkable how much Americans have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/democrats-republicans-blame-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:continued to blame Republicans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">continued to blame Republicans</a> more than Democrats for the shutdown, despite it being Democrats who are seeking the concession (i.e. an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies). A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/trump-shutdown-blame-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Post-ABC News poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Washington Post-ABC News poll</a> released Thursday showed 45% of Americans mainly blamed Trump and the GOP, versus 33% who held Democrats responsible.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>To be clear, the idea that Republicans could end the shutdown anytime they want is a vastly oversimplified talking point. Yes, all they need is a majority of the Senate to nuke the filibuster. But there are myriad reasons to avoid invoking that nuclear option. And Republican leaders have pointed to them for weeks — specifically invoking what they fear Democrats could do without that 60-vote threshold if they regain control of the chamber.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month called the filibuster “a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening to the country.” (His spokesperson on Friday said the leader’s position is “unchanged.”) Fellow Senate GOP leader John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that nixing the filibuster would ultimately allow Democrats to make Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states, with two senators apiece, and to pack the Supreme Court. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would mean there would be “no stumbling blocks or hurdles at all in the way of turning us into a communist country.”</p><p>But Trump is now legitimizing blaming his own party for the shutdown because they won’t have done the thing he told them to do.</p><p>And if you’re a Republican in Congress, you’ve probably got déjà vu about now. That’s because Trump does stuff like this a lot – especially during shutdown debates.</p><p>In early 2018, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/18/trump-is-a-legislative-arsonist/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">contradicted his own spokeswoman’s statement</a> of support for a short-term continuing resolution, making a late demand to scrap an extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program.</p><p>Trump then pulled another <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/02/06/trump-just-bear-hugged-the-blame-for-a-government-shutdown/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:11th-hour shift a few weeks later;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">11th-hour shift a few weeks later</a>, demanding immigration concessions that hadn’t previously been a focal point of leaders’ efforts.</p><p>Before he was sworn in to his second term in January, Trump and Elon Musk combined in December to play the role of legislative arsonists again. GOP leaders had negotiated a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. But then Musk started waging war against it on X. Trump then joined him and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/19/elon-musk-trump-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:threw another wrench in the cogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">threw another wrench in the cogs</a>, suddenly demanding a debt ceiling increase that hadn’t really been a part of discussions.</p><p>Trump has regularly given congressional Republicans fits in these situations – so much so that they’ll occasionally acknowledge their frustrations publicly.</p><p>Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2018 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/17/sen-mitch-mcconnells-passive-aggressive-dig-at-trump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:practically pleaded with Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">practically pleaded with Trump</a> to engage in the process and provide some direction. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels,” the Kentucky Republican said at the time.</p><p>After Trump threw a late grenade in the process in December, Sen. Kevin Cramer said he was “very frustrated.”</p><p>When CNN’s Manu Raju asked the North Dakota Republican if he wished Trump had signaled his demands earlier, Cramer <a href=\"https://x.com/mkraju/status/1869574967974588471\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:responded dryly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">responded dryly</a>: “Yeah, I mean, maybe he hadn’t thought about it until just today.

Perhaps GOP leaders will get through to Trump that this strategy isn’t particularly helpful – as they appear to have with other Republicans who occasionally suggested this route – and he’ll drop it.</p><p>But his late-night social media demand has at the very least put Republicans in the uncomfortable position of explaining why they don’t attempt to do the thing that is technically in their power to end the shutdown.</p><p>And we’re already seeing Republicans try and massage this issue away.</p><p>“What you’re seeing is an expression of the president’s anger at the situation,” Johnson said Friday.</p><p>Perhaps, but most presidents don’t lash out and kneecap their side’s negotiating power just because they get frustrated.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.</p><p>The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission comes as Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.</p><p>Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.</p><p>Meanwhile, senators in the Democrat-led Virginia General Assembly were expected to vote Friday on advancing a proposed constitutional amendment that would let them temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. That scheduled vote comes after the Virginia House passed the same resolution Wednesday.</p><p>Trump kicked off the redistricting fray this summer by urging Republican-led states to redraw voting districts ahead of next year’s congressional elections. Republicans in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina already have done so. Voters in Democratic-led California are deciding on new districts.</p><p>The political parties are in an intense battle, because Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.</p><p>Republicans already hold 10 of the 15 congressional seats in Ohio. The new map could boost Republican chances in districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo, an area that voted for Trump in last year’s presidential election. Kaptur won a 22nd term last fall by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, while Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In Virginia, the proposed constitutional amendment being considered by senators is in its early stages. After Friday, the resolution would need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters by way of a referendum.</p><p>Along with California, Virginia would be one of the few states with a Democratic-led legislature to enter the national redistricting battle.</p><p>“There’s a double standard for Democrats in authority that somehow we have to lay down while Donald Trump seizes power that we’ve never seen, and the Republicans run the play,” Virginia House Speaker Don Scott said this week.</p><p>Through the constitutional amendment, Virginia’s General Assembly would have the power to create a new congressional map only when other states do so between now and 2030. Democrats have not unveiled their planned map.</p><p>Asked about whether his party has begun drafting new districts, Scott said: “You’re not naive.”</p><p>The developments come as Virginia has statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.</p><p>The party’s bullish approach to redistricting reflects members’ confidence in holding onto power. There are roughly a dozen Republican-held seats that are vulnerable to being flipped this year, with Democrats vying to expand their legislative edge.</p><p>Conservatives blasted Democrats for undoing efforts to put the maps in the hands of a bipartisan commission, arguing the proceedings went against a Virginia custom of bipartisanship and decorum.</p><p>Republican US Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents a competitive seat, said this week that “there’s partisan games in Washington that it seems like the partisan games have now trickled down here in Richmond.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

major powers (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump&#39;s surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing provoked global criticism Friday amid fears of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement came in the wake of Russia saying it had tested a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable torpedo, as well as a new cruise missile.</p><p>But Trump sparked confusion as well as concern, with no clarity on whether he was ordering testing of US nuclear-capable systems or actual test blasts -- something the country has not done for three decades.</p><p>Iran, which has been in conflict with the United States for years over its controversial nuclear projects, called the directive &quot;regressive and irresponsible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>And Japanese atomic bomb survivors group Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.</p><p>The order &quot;directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable,&quot; the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group said in the letter obtained by AFP.</p><p>Trump pointedly made the nuclear tests announcement Thursday, minutes before he entered a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump posted on Truth Social.</p><p>- &#39;Pretty responsible&#39;&nbsp;-</p><p>Amid expressions of concern abroad and among some in the US Congress, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said &quot;resuming testing is a pretty responsible, very responsible&quot; policy.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly.&quot; Yet he too did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>China&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through a spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Russia pushed back against any idea that its recent weapons tests could justify a return to live test explosions.</p><p>And the Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations with Russia and China on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Russian stockpile of deployed and stored warheads is 4,309, compared to 3,700 for the United States and 600 for China -- figures that don&#39;t take into account hundreds of other warheads scheduled for dismantling.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992.</p><p>Its two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II make it the only country to have used the weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>burs-sms/md</p></div></article></div>",
