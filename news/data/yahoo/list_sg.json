Gorton and Denton on Friday. - Jon Super/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>The special election in northern England was supposed to be neck-and-neck-and-neck: a three-way scrap between the governing Labour Party, fighting to keep control of a seat in its historic heartland, and two outsiders – the hard-right populist Reform UK party, and the new-look progressive Green Party.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t even close.</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and member of the local council, won the seat in Gorton and Denton, near the English city of Manchester, with 14,890 votes, more than 40% of the total votes cast. Reform UK, which has led in most national polls for more than a year, came second with 10,578 votes, while Labour trailed in third, with 9,364 votes – around 25% of the total.</p><p>“I didn’t grow up wanting to be a politician. I’m a plumber,” Spencer said after the results were announced, apologizing to customers for having to cancel work now that she’s moving to Westminster. Spencer, who campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues, said she stood as a candidate after questioning the value of “hard work” in today’s Britain.</p><p>“Working hard used to get you something. It got you a house. A nice life. Holidays,” she said. “But now, working hard – what does that get you? Because talk to anyone here, and they will tell you. The people who work hard but can’t put food on the table. Can’t get their kids school uniforms. Can’t put the heating on… Life has changed.”</p><p>The result is an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is the Labour Party’s electoral backyard, made up of working-class voters, students and a large ethnic-minority population. Andrew Gwynne, the outgoing Labour MP who stood down due to health reasons, won the seat with more than 50% of the vote in the 2024 general election. Now, the Green Party has upended Starmer’s claim that only Labour can stop Reform from becoming the next government – an outcome that many experts have been predicting.</p><p>Spencer’s victory means the Greens now have five lawmakers in a parliament of 650, but more importantly marks the first time the Greens have won a by-election – a major boost to her party ahead of local elections in May, when voters will choose lawmakers for the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elect local council members in England. By-elections – votes held in individual seats between general elections – often have outsized significance, acting as a weathervane for national politics.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“The starting gun has fired on local elections in 70 days’ time,” Zack Polanski, the leader of the Greens, said at a victory rally early Friday morning. “This is an existential crisis for the Labour Party.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zh_QyrinEIKhRiHt_n4kjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/747c41eb43e331f7f6d0cf5eb88d4e57><noscript><img alt=\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zh_QyrinEIKhRiHt_n4kjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/747c41eb43e331f7f6d0cf5eb88d4e57 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Green Party leader Zack Polanski spoke with Spencer at a post-election rally in Manchester on Friday. - Jon Super/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Several recent Labour decisions have now been called into question. Among them is the party’s decision to target Reform UK – an upstart party led by Nigel Farage, the architect of Brexit and a friend of US President Donald Trump – as the “real opposition.” Despite winning just four seats at the last general election, Starmer decided early to elevate Reform to the status of Britain’s potential government-in-waiting, hoping that the prospect of Farage as prime minister would encourage voters to back Labour.</p><p>But the Greens’ victory means Labour is now fighting on two fronts. Having proclaimed Reform as the de facto opposition, Labour spent much of its first year in government trying to appeal to right-wing voters by hardening its rhetoric and policy on immigration.</p><p>Analysts questioned the wisdom of that strategy at the time. Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, told CNN that Labour seemed happy to risk upsetting progressive voters with its tougher stance on immigration, since those voters – faced with a choice between Labour and Reform – would ultimately “vote Labour to keep those bastards out.”</p><p>Now, that strategy may have backfired, as Labour realizes that chasing voters to its right has caused it to leak voters to its left.</p><p>“Our politicians have an absolutely appalling mental perception of what a northern voter looks like and thinks like,” Menon said. “This idea that everyone north of Watford is a total oik who’s basically a racist seems to be the common view now in our politics.”</p><p>Spencer’s victory casts doubt on that view. The Greens courted the constituency’s ethnic-minority voters, even publishing pre-election material in Urdu and Bangla. In her victory speech, Spencer criticized “divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society.”</p><p>Her remarks were a thinly -veiled attack on the Reform candidate Matt Goodwin, a former academic-turned-hard-right-activist, who had refused to disown his claim that people born in Britain from ethnic-minority backgrounds are not necessarily British. “It takes more than a piece of paper to make somebody ‘British,’” Goodwin said during the campaign.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FMkHqqtQXxcsaKIYReIfZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/86c5623a7cd0ef5d55cf29e6e6a1599d><noscript><img alt=\"Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FMkHqqtQXxcsaKIYReIfZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/86c5623a7cd0ef5d55cf29e6e6a1599d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Reform UK party candidate Matt Goodwin looks on after his defeat to Spencer and the Greens. - Temilade Adelaja/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Farage said the result was a “victory for sectarian voting,” and a victory for “cheating in elections,” without providing evidence. Concerns were raised, however, by Democracy Volunteers, a group of independent election observers, about “extremely high” levels of family voting, in which a family member is seen to be influencing somebody else’s vote, for instance by entering a polling booth with them.</p><p>The result has also called into question Labour’s decision to block Andy Burnham, the hugely popular Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester who is seen as a potential leadership rival to Starmer, from standing in the election. Karl Turner, a Labour MP, told the BBC that he had “begged” Starmer not to block Burnham from standing in the election, saying he was “without a shadow of a doubt” that he would have won.</p><p>Labour’s decision to hold the by-election earlier than necessary now also appears to have backfired, since it will boost the Greens ahead of local elections on May 7. Labour MPs have previously told CNN that a disastrous set of results in those elections could prompt the party to oust Starmer as leader.</p><p>Starmer said the result was “very disappointing.” He pointed out that incumbent governments “often get results like that mid-term,” but stressed that he understands voters are “impatient for change.”</p><p>Polanski, whose leadership has re-energized the Green Party, looks set to profit off that impatience.</p><p>“Labour’s electoral stranglehold is over,” he told a crowd in Manchester. “This is a seismic victory. We have torn the roof off British politics. And that’s because people now recognize there is an alternative.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

in the desert of Niger, scientists have unearthed an unknown species of dinosaur, a giant fissvery of its kind in more than a century.</p><p>Around 95 million years ago, the Spinosaurus -- a massive beast with a blade-shaped head crest and interlocking teeth -- roamed the African continent.</p><p>Scientists believe it rivalled the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex in size, measuring around 40 feet long with a 20-inch sword-like crest on its head.</p><p>Researchers dug up fossils that belonged to the Spinosaurus mirabilis -- or &quot;hell heron&quot;, in the words of Paul Sereno, the University of Chicago palaeontologist and lead author of the research published in the journal Science.</p><p>&quot;Look at the length of the skull, the length of the neck, and the length of the hind limb --

Previously, most spinosaurid fossils had been found near coastlines in North Africa.</p><p>Some scientists thought these fish-eating creatures may have been fully aquatic, gliding through deep waters to snare prey.</p><p>But this time, the fossils were discovered further inland, hundreds of miles from what would have been the nearest ocean.</p><p>&quot;I think it was an animal that could have waded easily into the water,&quot; Sereno said.</p><p>&quot;But I do not think it was a diver, I do not think it was a good swimmer.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Earth-shattering site&#39; -</p><p>The search began in 2019 in the Sahara Desert, where French geologist Hugues Faure had said he found a tooth belonging to the giant predator Carcharodontosaurus in the 1950s.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve got a couple of things that Faure could never dream of. We have GPS coordinates, we have drones and better vehicles,&quot; said Sereno.</p><p>The barren sands yielded nothing and the team, disheartened, headed back to their camp.</p><p>But a Tuareg man in a black trench coat approached Sereno&#39;s team on a motorcycle, claiming to know where &quot;big bones&quot; lay.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>After a long journey through the desert, Sereno worried they &quot;had made a mistake&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We jokingly said, are we still in Niger?

I have ever seen in my life&quot; emerged from the ground.</p><p>Far out in the desert, the researchers gaped at the six-foot-long femur, the jaw, teeth, and base of the crest.</p><p>In 2022, Sereno returned with a 100-person team and 64 Nigerien guards to excavate the &quot;earth-shattering site&quot;.</p><p>They unearthed a skull, fragments of the hind legs and several crests.</p><p>&quot;The crest was like nothing we&#39;d ever seen before,&quot; said Sereno.</p><p>Some were brought to tears, he said, by the &quot;overwhelming&quot; experience.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s actually like looking at a digital image of your new dinosaur and gawking over it in the tent in the middle of the Sahara.&quot;</p><p>The team realised &quot;it was a new species... and it was going to be a landmark discovery.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s your Jurassic Park moment... one to remember for a lifetime.&quot;</p><p>cgc/bam/rh/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

The bill ⁠needs to pass through the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</p><p>GERMANY</p><p>Minors aged 13 to 16 are allowed to use social media only if their parents provide consent. But child protection advocates say controls are insufficient.</p><p>GREECE</p><p>Greece is &quot;very close&quot; to announcing a social media ⁠ban for children under 15, a senior government source told Reuters on February 3.</p><p>INDIA</p><p>India&#39;s chief economic adviser called for age restrictions on social media platforms in January, describing them as &quot;predatory&quot; in how they keep users engaged online, two days after tourist state Goa said it was weighing restrictions akin to Australia&#39;s.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>ITALY</p><p>Children under the age of 14 need parental consent to sign up for ​social ​media accounts, while no consent is required above that age.</p><p>MALAYSIA</p><p>Malaysia said in November it would ban ​social media for users under the age of 16 starting from ‌2026.</p><p>NORWAY</p><p>The Norwegian government in October 2024 proposed raising the age at which children can consent to the terms required to use social media to 15 from 13, although parents would still be permitted to sign off on their behalf if they are under the age limit.</p><p>The government has also begun work on legislation to set an absolute minimum age limit of 15 for social media use.</p><p>POLAND</p><p>Poland&#39;s ruling party is preparing new legislation to ban social media for children under 15 years of age and to hold platforms responsible for age verification, it said on February 27.</p><p>SLOVENIA</p><p>Slovenia is drafting a law that would prohibit children under 15 from accessing social media, Deputy Prime Minister Matej Arcon said in ‌a news conference on February 6.</p><p>SPAIN</p><p>Spain will ban access to social media for minors under 16 ​and platforms will be required to implement age verification systems, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said early ​in February.</p><p>It was unclear if the proposed ban would require approval by the ​country&#39;s highly fragmented lower house.</p><p>THE U.S.</p><p>The Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act prevents companies from collecting personal data from children under 13 without ‌parental consent. Several states have passed laws requiring parental consent for minors ​to access social media, but they have ​faced court challenges on free speech grounds.</p><p>EU LEGISLATION</p><p>The European Parliament in November agreed on a resolution which is not legally binding calling for a minimum age of 16 on social media.</p><p>It urged a harmonised EU digital age limit of 13 for social media access and an age limit of 13 for video-sharing ​services and &quot;AI companions&quot;.</p><p>TECH INDUSTRY</p><p>Social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook and ‌Snapchat say people need to be at least 13 to sign up.</p><p>Child protection advocates say the controls are insufficient, and official data in several ​European countries shows huge numbers of children under 13 have social media accounts.</p><p>($1 = 1.4174 Australian dollars)</p><p>(Compiled by Christine Chen in Sydney, Hugo Lhomedet, Paolo ​Laudani and Lucie Barbier in Gdansk; Editing by Milla Nissi-Prussak, Bernadette Baum and Matt Scuffham)</p></div></article></div>",

At the dinner table, my stories would meander. My mom tells me my stories had branches and my branches had branches. She says I loved to tell the same story over and over, which charmed her, but my dad got impatient. I could tell when he trailed off. He’d look away or at his food or sometimes change the subject. I always wanted more of his time and attention. I always felt rejected.</p><p>When I started competing in sports, he tuned in more, but it was still my mom who took me to tennis tournaments on the weekends and sat in the stands while I won or lost and then celebrated or consoled me during the car rides home.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-history-father-doctors-visits_n_699dcb46e4b0689d85504b69?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:My Father Emotionally Abandoned Our Family — And I Have To Relive It Every Time I Go To The Doctor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">My Father Emotionally Abandoned Our Family — And I Have To Relive It Every Time I Go To The Doctor</a></strong></p><p>When I talk to Tony about our childhood, he agrees that our parents consisted mostly of our mom.

He worked every day, including half days on Saturdays, and drove an hour each way to his optometric office downtown. He provided. He was kind. He wasn’t present in the day-to-day, but he did somehow impart words of wisdom that I’ve remembered my whole life and still live by.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 847px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:134%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt='\"This is a classic shot of my dad — having a drink and smoking a cigar — in 1990,\" the author writes. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span>' data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QzAmcgCab1KCEdfIEATvmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNjcw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/14f7ea0289846f7324a4dd94f8a87c9d><noscript><img alt='\"This is a classic shot of my dad — having a drink and smoking a cigar — in 1990,\" the author writes. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span>' src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QzAmcgCab1KCEdfIEATvmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNjcw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/14f7ea0289846f7324a4dd94f8a87c9d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>\"This is a classic shot of my dad — having a drink and smoking a cigar — in 1990,\" the author writes. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>On a family vacation when I was about 8 and my brother was 10, the three of us were fishing at this spot we loved in Duck Key, Florida.

I sat on the end of my mom’s bed talking to my mom about how afraid I was to leave home. My dad was lying back, watching a game on TV, one of his full-time positions. I was sure he wasn’t listening, and then, without taking his eyes off the game, he told me I’d be all right on the day I left. “Fantasy,” he said, “is always better or worse than reality.”</p><p>The summer after my first year of college, I knew my mom told my dad I’d had *** for the first time with my old high school boyfriend. I’d told my mom I wasn’t in love, but he was a good guy and I didn’t want to die an old maid. A few nights later, my dad fixed me a drink, vodka on the rocks, and motioned for me to join him on a balcony at a family party. I felt awkward, looking over the marina in Coconut Grove. I was 19. We’d never shared a drink together. We’d never hung out, just the two of us, for the purpose of talking. He was cool, and in his Zen-like way he said, “It’s better to love than be loved.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 437px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:69%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4pTj6VOX3X1AyAysoyd2vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4ebf156b38ecd68157a23ed35cfc18c3><noscript><img alt=\"The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4pTj6VOX3X1AyAysoyd2vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4ebf156b38ecd68157a23ed35cfc18c3 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author and her dad celebrating the birth of her first niece in 1995. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><em>Like this article?

About 35 years ago, my dad left optometry and started a commercial real-estate business. Soon, Tony joined him and the two became partners and bought properties and rented out warehouse spaces. My dad was the guy who negotiated with banks and buyers. He understood interest rates, percentages and people. He did stacks — a financial breakdown of cash in, minus expenses on management and maintenance — with a pencil and paper. He could remember a stack on a property — on multiple properties — from year to year. He never used a calculator.</p><p>Tony says he learned everything about business and managing people from my dad. Now, he says, they think exactly alike.</p><p>Tony called me yesterday after taking my dad to Flanigan’s for dinner. The waiter told Tony that my dad’s aide brought him earlier that day for lunch.</p><p>I asked, “Did he have a cheeseburger?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What did he have for lunch?”</p><p>“A cheeseburger!”</p><p>We both laughed until Tony said. “This is rough.”</p><p>Tony was the first to notice my dad wasn’t on his game. It was five or so years ago in a meeting with their accountant. My dad did a stack, but couldn’t remember he’d just done it. He wasn’t able to evaluate the stack against the previous year. He repeated himself.</p><p>These days, Tony will occasionally consult my dad to keep him involved in the business and to test his own logic. But he feels alone now. Tony lost his mentor and his mate.</p><p>My dad knows he can’t remember what he did this morning or how to get to my house, but when I ask if he’s stressed about his memory, he says, “What can I do?”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 778px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:123%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author and her dad in 2025.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xV6GbrG_9flbF31iA1dUVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTM0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b1117a184ae4f5711d7044c348f1d25d><noscript><img alt=\"The author and her dad in 2025.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xV6GbrG_9flbF31iA1dUVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTM0/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/b1117a184ae4f5711d7044c348f1d25d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author and her dad in 2025. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Andrea Askowitz</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>When I was a kid, I wanted my dad to listen to my stories about what my teachers said in class and what I did with my friends on the weekends, but that wasn’t my dad.

change in order to win self-determination for the Kurds.</p><p>Iraq&#39;s autonomous Kurdistan region has long been a haven for Kurdish Iranian armed factions, which have repeatedly faced cross-border strikes from Iran.</p><p>&quot;We cannot take the side of either the Americans or the Iranians. Our cause is different... our goal is democratic change in Iran -- a democracy that will benefit the Kurdish people,&quot; said Mazloum Haftan, a senior commander in the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK).</p><p>&quot;We will neither attack Iran nor defend the current regime. We have chosen a third path: working towards democratic, peaceful change,&quot; the 54-year-old added.</p><p>An AFP team of journalists met Haftan and his fellow fighters in a bunker carved into a rugged mountainous area, now blanketed with snow, near the border with Iran.</p><p>Iran has designated his group as a terrorist organisation, and many Iranian Kurdish groups like his have previously fought Iranian security forces in Kurdish-majority areas along the border.</p><p>But in recent years, they have largely refrained from armed activity, although they continue to actively campaign from exile against the Islamic republic.</p><p>They recently stepped up their lobbying after mass anti-government protests in Iran that sparked a deadly crackdown, and as the United States conducted a military build-up in the region not seen in decades.</p><p>- &#39;With blood&#39; -</p><p>If war breaks out, Haftan said he believes Iran might target Kurdish opposition positions in northern Iraq.</p><p>He also said Iranian authorities have already started boosting their security and military presence in Kurdish-majority areas of western Iran.</p><p>The impact of any US strikes would very much depend on how far they go. Should they go as far as effecting regime change, Haftan said groups like his would aim for &quot;a decentralised system after having tried the monarchy and the Supreme Leader rule&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Last week, the PJAK and another four exiled groups announced&nbsp;a political coalition to seek the overthrow of Iran&#39;s Islamic republic and ultimately to secure Kurdish self-determination.</p><p>Kurdish opposition groups have long supported anti-government protests in Iran.&nbsp;Last month, they called for a general strike in support of the demonstrations.</p><p>In 2022, Iran launched deadly military strikes on exiled Kurdish Iranian militants, accusing them of instigating protests sparked by the death in custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini.</p><p>In Iran, &quot;the Kurds have been at the forefront of the struggle for democracy and freedom. When one leads people, one must pay a price—we have paid in blood,&quot; Haftan said.</p><p>- &#39;An opportunity&#39; -</p><p>The Kurds, whose community spans areas of Turkey through Syria, Iraq and Iran, make up one of Iran&#39;s most important non-Persian ethnic minority groups.</p><p>The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) is one of the oldest and biggest Kurdish Iranian opposition groups, and it has lost fighters and commanders, including three of its chiefs, to Iranian fire.</p><p>Despite his enmity with the Iranian state, PDKI commander Mohammed Nazif Kader told AFP over the phone his group has not supported Israeli or American attacks on the Islamic republic.</p><p>&quot;Our coalition relies on the Iranian people, especially the Kurds,&quot; he said.</p><p>But &quot;if a war breaks out, it will likely create an opportunity for the Iranian opposition to return&quot; and &quot;seek to establish a democratic system&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We are on full alert and fully prepared... and for all forms of struggle,&quot; he added.</p><p>str/rh/ser</p></div></article></div>",
