The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.</p><p>Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.</p><p>The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.</p><p>At least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.</p><p>Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.</p><p>The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.</p><h3>Jamaica hardest hit</h3><p>Jamaica took the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/video/jamaica-roads-hurricane-melissa-digivid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:heaviest battering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">heaviest battering</a>.

There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.</p><p>In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”</p><p>Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.</p><p>Three people also died during storm preparations.</p><p>Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a Tuesday <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjis.gov.jm%2Fgovernment-establishes-website-to-mobilise-support-after-hurricane-melissa-passes%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CSophie.Tanno%40cnn.com%7Ce02d55974552412c479c08de1790eda8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638974108682955445%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2xX0%2FDCf3bAzbbXFGQFYka4JMx54bA8xZeq3zAPFO8s%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">statement</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, more than 13,000 residents were still in shelters, while 72% of the island was without power, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1J6WrM9r9I\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jamaican government officials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Jamaican government officials</a> said.</p><p>Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a><noscript><img alt=\"Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5PfsxX7Zs3oh1HaMQBE2TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f52bf40c3c917cd8a4c769e077b97b6a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Residents walk through Lacovia Tombstone, Jamaica, in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Wednesday. - Matias Delacroix/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.</p><p>Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.</p><h3>‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba</h3><p>Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday.

The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.</p><p>The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.</p><p>Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.</p><p>States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”</p><p>While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PAeRiLuOIm7wCzJQHysoyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/999a236cb31311259d6cfcc9a770d5c4><noscript><img alt=\"An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PAeRiLuOIm7wCzJQHysoyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/999a236cb31311259d6cfcc9a770d5c4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.</p><p>Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran.

Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.</p><p>It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”</p><p>“We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”</p><p>Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.</p><p>“Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.</p><p>The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.</p><p>“Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles. That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.</p><h3>Long-standing ties</h3><p>China has long been a <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/07/18/china/china-iran-sco-israel-axis-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic and economic ally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic and economic ally</a> for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.</p><p>That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DdvKlfzFLs_mTJ.mZGCEnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5dd395a4bfe38bd243c94b76a0806977><noscript><img alt=\"Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DdvKlfzFLs_mTJ.mZGCEnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5dd395a4bfe38bd243c94b76a0806977 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.</p><h3>Earlier shipments</h3><p>In February, CNN <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/02/13/middleeast/iran-is-rearming-its-missile-program-and-a-ship-of-supplies-just-arrived-from-china-western-sources-say?cid=ios_app&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported the shipment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">reported the shipment</a> of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”</p><p>Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.</p><p>The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.</p><p>Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.</p><p>“First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.</p><p>Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.</p><p>Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program.

In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”</p><p>Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.</p><p>So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.</p><p>“Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”</p><p><em>CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>Trump&#39;s announcement left much unanswered -- chiefly whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Key US foe Iran on Friday called the directive &quot;regressive and irresponsible&quot;, adding that it was a threat to international security.</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons.

capture of the western city of El-Fasher,&nbsp;as a UN official warned the &quot;horror is continuing&quot; in both Darfur and neighbouring Kordofan.</p><p>At war with the army since April 2023, the RSF seized El-Fasher on Sunday, dislodging the army&#39;s last stronghold in western Darfur after an 18-month siege marked by bombardment and starvation.</p><p>It has faced widespread accusations of grave abuses after taking the city, with survivors who reached the nearby town of Tawila telling AFP of mass killings, children shot in front of their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled.</p><p>In a statement late Thursday,&nbsp;the RSF said it had detained several fighters accused of &quot;violations that occurred during the liberation&quot; of El-Fasher, including one known as Abu Lulu who appeared in multiple videos on his TikTok committing summary executions.</p><p>In one clip verified by AFP, he is seen shooting unarmed men at close range. Another shows him standing among armed men celebrating near dozens of bodies and burnt vehicles.</p><p>The RSF released a video appearing to show Abu Lulu behind bars in what they claimed to be a North Darfur prison.</p><p>The RSF also affirmed its adherence to &quot;the law, rules of conduct and military discipline during wartime&quot;, saying that it had begun investigations to bring the fighters to justice.</p><p>&quot;Abu Lulu is arrested and will be brought to a fair trial according to the law,&quot; one RSF member says in the video.</p><p>Since Sunday, videos circulating online have purportedly shown men in RSF uniforms carrying out summary executions around the city, which has been cut off from all communications since its fall.</p><p>Emtithal Mahmoud, a US-based Sudanese poet from El-Fasher, told AFP she recognised her cousin, Nadifa, in a video shared by RSF accounts, lying dead on the ground.</p><p>- &#39;Horror is continuing&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Sudanese analyst Kholood Khair said she was sceptical that the purported arrests would bring an end to the violence.</p><p>&quot;We expect these atrocities to continue, particularly against non-Arab groups,&quot; she told AFP, citing communities such as the Zaghawa, Fur, Berti and Masalit in Darfur.</p><p>In 2023, the RSF -- descended from the Janjaweed Arab militias accused of mass atrocities in Darfur two decades ago -- was blamed for massacres against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur capital El-Geneina, killing up to 15,000 people.</p><p>&quot;Overall, these patterns reflect a disturbing repetition of ethnic tensions from 20 years ago, now compounded by disputes over resource control and political power in the country,&quot; Khair said.</p><p>More than 36,000 people have fled El-Fasher since Sunday, according to the UN&#39;s migration agency, while the fate of about 177,000 civilians still trapped in the city remains unknown.</p><p>The UN said Thursday that around 1,750 people had also fled the North Darfur town of Tina -- to the west of El-Fasher -- across the border into neighbouring Chad.</p><p>UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the Security Council on Thursday there were &quot;credible reports of widespread executions&quot; after the RSF entered El-Fasher.</p><p>&quot;We cannot hear the screams, but... the horror is continuing,&quot; he said, describing rapes, mutilations and killings with impunity.</p><p>Fletcher said the RSF claimed to be investigating, but questioned its commitment amid the &quot;appalling news&quot; from North Darfur.</p><p>RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo had earlier vowed accountability for &quot;anyone who has made a mistake&quot;.</p><p>Satellite imagery analysed by Yale&#39;s Humanitarian Research Lab showed clusters in the city &quot;consistent with adult human bodies&quot;, and discolouration that may indicate &quot;pools of blood&quot;, its director told AFP.</p><p>- Bloodshed in Kordofan -</p><p>Fletcher warned that bloodshed in Sudan was spreading beyond Darfur, with atrocities reported in the neighbouring Kordofan region.</p><p>According to UN figures, between Sunday and Wednesday more than 35,000 people fled five localities in North Kordofan state, including Bara, which lies north of state capital El-Obeid on a key route to Darfur and was overrun by paramilitaries on Saturday.</p><p>Martha Pobee, the assistant UN secretary-general for Africa, highlighted &quot;reports of large-scale atrocities perpetrated&quot; by the RSF in Bara, including, &quot;reprisals against so-called &#39;collaborators&#39;, which are often ethnically motivated&quot;.</p><p>At least 50 civilians were killed there in recent days, both in fighting and executions, including five Red Crescent volunteers, according to the UN.</p><p>Kordofan is &quot;clearly going to be the next area of military escalation&quot;, analyst Khair said.</p><p>On Thursday, the RSF accused the army of launching a drone attack on a school in eastern North Kordofan, claiming dozens of students and teachers were killed or injured -- an allegation the army denied.</p><p>AFP could not independently verify the attack.</p><p>Both the army and the RSF have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict.</p><p>The US has previously determined the RSF committed genocide in Darfur.</p><p>El-Fasher&#39;s fall to the RSF gave it full control over all five state capitals in Darfur, effectively splitting Sudan along an east-west axis. The paramilitaries have also established a self-declared rival government in Darfur.</p><p>The army holds Sudan&#39;s north, east and centre.</p><p>bur-maf/smw</p></div></article></div>",
