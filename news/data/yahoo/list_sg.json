done exactly what he did in the first term, and that is bend over backwards to make sure that we mitigate the harm,” Johnson said, incorrectly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Regarding the early benefits in 2019, the Justice Department noted in its brief that the Government Accountability Office said the early dispersal was unlawful, but also portrayed it as a successful gambit that’s just no longer available.</p><p>“In January 2019, though there were insufficient long-term emergency fund moneys available, USDA was able to structure ‘early issuance’ of benefits and the lapse ended before any

strange preference when withholding SNAP’s contingency reserves means that 42 million real people will face immediate crises obtaining food.”</span></p><p><span>In response to the coming food cliff, Democrats have increased the number of press conferences they’re holding this week and introduced standalone bills to keep the SNAP money flowing, only to see the legislation blocked or ignored by

United States to a record low and give priority to white South Africans.</p><p>Under the new policy, the United States would welcome 7,500 refugees in fiscal 2026, down from more than 100,000 a year under Democratic president Joe Biden.</p><p>The vast majority of those being accepted during the fiscal year which began on October 1 would be white South Africans and &quot;other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,&quot; according to a White House memo.</p><p>&quot;The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa,&quot; it said.</p><p>Republican President Donald Trump essentially halted refugee arrivals after taking office in January, but has been making an exception for white South Africans despite Pretoria&#39;s insistence that they do not face persecution in their homeland.</p><p>A first group of around 50 Afrikaners -- descendants of the first European settlers of South Africa -- arrived for resettlement in the United States in May.</p><p>Trump campaigned for the White House on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants and signed an executive order in January suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program.</p><p>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said that since 1980 more than two million people fleeing persecution have been admitted into the United States under the program.</p><p>&quot;Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,&quot; Reichlin-Melnick said on X. &quot;What a downfall for a crown jewel of America&#39;s international humanitarian programs.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Lifeline&#39; -</p><p>Krish O&#39;Mara Vignarajah, president of another immigration-focused group, Global Refuge, also criticized the move by the Trump administration.</p><p>&quot;For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression,&quot; Vignarajah said in a statement.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program&#39;s purpose as well as its credibility.&quot;</p><p>In addition to slashing refugee numbers, the Trump administration has moved to strip Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, Haitians, Venezuelans and nationals of several other countries.</p><p>The United States grants TPS to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters or other &quot;extraordinary&quot; conditions.</p><p>Trump has said the Afrikaners being taken in as refugees by the United States are fleeing a &quot;terrible situation&quot; back home and has even gone so far as to describe it as &quot;genocide,&quot; an allegation widely dismissed as absurd.</p><p>Whites, who make up 7.3 percent of South Africa&#39;s population, generally enjoy a higher standard of living than the Black majority. They still own two-thirds of farmland and on average earn three times as much as Black South Africans.</p><p>Mainly Afrikaner-led governments imposed the race-based apartheid system that denied Black people political and economic rights until it was voted out in 1994.</p><p>cl/bjt</p></div></article></div>",

class=caas-body><p>WASHINGTON ― Senate Democrats are furious that the Trump administration held a briefing for lawmakers on Wednesday about U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and only invited Republican senators to attend.</p><p>“What the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive not only to our democracy but downright dangerous for our national security,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Thursday, warning that the move set a “troubling precedent” that had trampled on the longheld bipartisan tradition of bipartisan briefings of Congress on U.S. military activities abroad.</p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-layoffs-blind-workers_n_69026d4ce4b0e763a61c852f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump’s Shutdown Layoffs Hit Blind Workers Who Help The Blind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Trump’s Shutdown Layoffs Hit Blind Workers Who Help The Blind</a></strong></p><p>“They know they screwed up,” Warner added of Trump’s White House. “And where in the hell were my Republican senators, whom we have worked on everything [with] in a bipartisan fashion? Why didn’t they say, ‘Isn’t this a little bit weird they don’t have any Democrats in the room?’”</p><p>The U.S. military killed 14 people in missile strikes against alleged drug cartel boats in the Eastern Pacific earlier this week, part of nearly a dozen attacks on vessels off the coast of Venezuela in recent months. Critics have called the use of force unconstitutional since it lacks congressional authorization. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pressed for more information about the strikes, including their legal justification.</p><p>The briefing was held for Republican senators who sought more information on the strikes and included a memo from the White House Office of Legal Counsel on their legal justification. Democrats have been pressing for similar information but have been rebuffed by the White House.</p><p>Several GOP senators sided with Warner on the matter, urging the Trump administration to brief Democrats on the military strikes as well. Republicans know that freezing Democrats ought of a briefing on matters of war could come back to bite them in the future under a Democratic presidential administration.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-rocker-new-york-city-mayor_n_69020f28e4b0a858340825ee?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Ex-MLB Pitcher And Bigot Throws Hate At NYC Mayoral Candidate Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Ex-MLB Pitcher And Bigot Throws Hate At NYC Mayoral Candidate Mamdani</a></strong></p><p>Sen.

Some military families rely on that support to prevent hunger even while receiving paychecks.</p><p>For many military families who have children with complex medical problems, the government shutdown has already resulted in significant unforeseen expenses.</p><p>“Military treatment facilities are telling us that they’re unable to order some of the medications that families are needing,” said Austin Carrigg, an active duty Army spouse and CEO of Exceptional Families of the Military, a nonprofit supporting military families with members who have special medical or educational needs.</p><p>Carrigg said those families are going to civilian pharmacies where they’re charged co-pays they would not be responsible for at military hospitals.</p><p>“A handful of families that we’ve spoken with are so paralyzed with fear that they haven’t (prepared) because they can’t figure out where to start,” she said.</p><p>Managing those expenses without a paycheck would be impossible for some families, like one military spouse who went viral for calling into C-SPAN not long after the shutdown began to confront House Speaker Mike Johnson as he appeared as a guest on the network.</p><p>“I have two medically fragile children, and I have a husband who actively serves this country. He suffers from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) from his two tours in Afghanistan. If we see a lapse in pay (…) my children do not get the medication that’s needed for them to live their life,” the spouse, who identified herself as Samantha, a Republican from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, desperately pleaded.</p><p>“I am begging you to pass this legislation. My kids could die. We don’t have the credit because of the medical bills that I have to pay regularly,” she said.</p><p>The anxiety military families feel about the prospect of a missed paycheck is compounded by the military spouse unemployment crisis.</p><p>Though half of active duty spouses have attained at least a bachelor’s degree, their unemployment rate is 20%, almost five times the national average.</p><p>Frequent moves – often every two to three years – stifle the ability of military spouses to find a job or maintain a career in the field in which they are trained.</p><p>A significant number of spouses have also been recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/military-families-federal-government-cuts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:fired from federal jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">fired from federal jobs</a>, after multiple administrations marketed the federal workforce as the employer of choice for military spouses and offered remote work options that helped spouses needing to move with service members. President Donald Trump even signed an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/trump-military-spouse-employment?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:executive order to increase military spouse hiring;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">executive order to increase military spouse hiring</a>.</p><p>Others who survived Department of Government Efficiency cuts during Trump’s second term now find themselves furloughed from their jobs or working without pay.</p><p>Taken together, the challenges of military life and the effects of the shutdown have pushed some military families to their breaking points.</p><p>On its website, Blue Star Families, the nation’s leading nonprofit serving military and veteran families (of which, full disclosure, I am a member of the board) is directing military families to partner organizations that can provide no-cost counseling.</p><p>“This is a disaster for many families, and it’s a disaster both financially, but it also has a psychological impact to put your life on the line, to accept government orders no matter what, and to be at risk of not being paid for the essential work that you’re doing,” Blue Star Families co-founder and CEO Kathy Roth Duquet told CNN’s John Berman this month.</p><p>The organization is hearing from hundreds of military families who are less likely to recommend military service to others because of the government shutdown, raising questions about a potential national security impact of this impasse between Congress and Trump.</p><p>As America risks breaking its covenant with service members – to meet their basic needs and those of their family members so they can focus on protecting the country – it shouldn’t be surprising. In a nation that relies on an all-volunteer force, it should be beyond alarming.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

At the time, I was heavily pregnant myself, and I distinctly thought, </span><em><span>My baby will not be chill.</span></em><span> Because, well, I’m not chill.</span></p><p><span>Whether it was a premonition, a self-fulfilling prophecy, or just my intuition, my baby was indeed many things: curious, adorable, with my husband’s thick dark hair and sweet brown eyes.

I remember bouncing on a yoga ball, and if I stopped for even a second, the howls would start again. I convinced myself that my breast milk was the problem, so I cut out everything except quinoa and sweet potatoes. That helped me lose the baby weight but did nothing for my mental health.</span></p><p><span>Then came solids, which brought a whole new nightmare. It turned out she had severe food allergies. I had already confirmed a few allergies, so I always kept an EpiPen in her diaper bag. But, of course, the one day I left the diaper bag in the car was the day my husband decided to drive to the office. And, naturally, it was also the day I discovered a completely new allergy. My baby’s face started to swell after I gave her something I thought was safe. I panicked and called an ambulance, but due to COVID, they were slow to respond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Thankfully, my husband made it home before things got worse. We used the EpiPen, and she was fine. I, however, was not.

In fact, nobody would know that I’m </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> parent. I let my kids climb the bars at the park without hovering. I make myself </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> hover — purposely. I let my kids go to birthday parties, even if there are foods around that could send them to the hospital. I’m careful but not crazy.</span></p><p><span>If you asked my mom friends, they’d likely say I’m not a helicopter parent. And that’s intentional. I made the decision to not over-control for two reasons: so my kids don’t grow up with anxiety thinking the worst will happen at any moment, and so I don’t drive myself crazy. It’s been a journey. Could I do better at chilling the f**k out? Sure. But overall, I think I’m doing OK.</span></p><p><span>That is, until I lost my s**t — not because of my own anxiety, but because of someone else’s.</span></p><p><span>It happened during my eldest’s gymnastics class. It’s a drop-off one, meaning parents get a blessed 45 minutes to leisurely stroll to the nearest coffee shop, doomscroll, or just stare at a wall. That was my routine until one day, my peaceful scroll was interrupted by a parent running full speed across the gym toward what I assumed was their child, for no apparent reason. Then, this parent hovered around their child, completely oblivious to the coaches and the other kids, disrupting the class.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-ad-voiceover-actors-police_n_68fcfec8e4b011e8088689fa?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say</a></strong></p><p><span>“Is there a problem?” I found myself saying as the group moved closer to the bleachers where other parents were waiting, most glued to their phones. “Are you worried about their safety? Because the coaches know what they’re doing. They’ve got this.”</span></p><p><span>This parent seemed taken aback and muttered something about it being their child’s first drop-off class and wanting to “make sure” their kid was OK.</span></p><p><em><span>Bulls**t</span></em><span>, I thought. The kid was fine. This parent was the one who wasn’t.</span></p><p><span>“Do you see that parent out there getting in the coaches’ way?” I said to anyone nearby, most of whom were barely paying attention to the class. “Yah... annoying,” they replied, chuckling a bit.

She asked, “Do you think the other parents were as annoyed as you were?”</span></p><p><span>I thought back to the bleachers. No one seemed to notice much. “No,” I admitted.</span></p><p><span>“Well, that’s worth thinking about,” she said. “Umm, no,” was my initial response to that one. But I took a beat and really thought about it. Sure, this parent was kind of the worst, but they weren’t really disrupting the class or stopping the coaches from doing their job. Annoying? Yes. Rage-worthy? Maybe not.</span></p><p><span>One of my friends later texted again: “I don’t think you should put the picture on Facebook. It’s irritating as hell, but they’re not a danger to society.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then it hit me. The reason I was raging.</span></p><p><span>It was because I </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> that parent. On the inside. But I’d learned to control it, to keep it in check. Watching this parent’s anxiety spill out so publicly made me feel exposed, like they were revealing what I was struggling to hide.</span></p><p><span>“You should have compassion for them,” another friend said. “They’re clearly suffering, and this is how they’re coping.”</span></p><p><span>My friends were right.</span></p><p><span>I tried to let the anger dissipate. Instead, I replaced it with compassion. Because, someday, there might be a moment where I can’t keep my anxiety in check, and I can only hope that, if it happens, people will have compassion for me, too. And you know, not publicly shame me either. After all, as parents, we’re just doing the best we can — and we don’t always/rarely get it right.</span></p><p><em>This piece was previously published on HuffPost and is being rerun as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.</em></p><p><em>Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

of Jamaica and Cuba in ruins.</p><p>Flooding is expected to subside in the Bahamas later on Thursday, although it could persist in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the US National Hurricane Center said.</p><p>The storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.</p><p>It was forecast to pass over Bermuda by late Thursday packing maximum sustained winds near 105 miles (165 kilometers) per hour, with the government urging residents to take precautionary measures against the still-powerful storm.</p><p>Melissa smashed into both Jamaica and Cuba with enormous force, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery.</p><p>Communications and transportation access remains largely down in both nations, and comprehensive assessment of the damage could take days.</p><p>In the east of the communist island of Cuba, which is battling its worst economic crisis in decades, people struggled through inundated streets lined with flooded and collapsed homes.</p><p>The storm smashed windows, downed power cables

Post/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.</p><p>After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”</p><p>That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/politics/james-comey-arraignment?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:James Comey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> James Comey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/letitia-james-arraignment-10-24-25?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Letitia James,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Letitia James,</a> delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.</p><p>On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.</p><p>The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.</p><p>“My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.</p><p>In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/politics/letitia-james-grand-jury-trump-indictment?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:James;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">James</a> have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/lindsey-halligan-ousts-more-prosecutors-eastern-district-virginia?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Lindsey Halligan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> Lindsey Halligan</a>, whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.</p><p>More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.</p><p>“Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”</p><p>Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.</p><p>His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.</p><p>Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.</p><p>Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ed Martin, then the president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a conservative political organization based in St. Louis, Missouri, speaks during a news conference outside the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on November 5, 2020. - Al Drago/Getty Images/File\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3g8rLlZT79X54.hb0OLpRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3c8144ad28e2da6c5330c3f4ad8860a6><noscript><img alt=\"Ed Martin, then the president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a conservative political organization based in St. Louis, Missouri, speaks during a news conference outside the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on November 5, 2020. - Al Drago/Getty Images/File\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3g8rLlZT79X54.hb0OLpRg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3c8144ad28e2da6c5330c3f4ad8860a6 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ed Martin, then the president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles, a conservative political organization based in St. Louis, Missouri, speaks during a news conference outside the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on November 5, 2020. - Al Drago/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.</p><p>As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”</p><p>Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.</p><p>His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.</p><p>But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.</p><p>In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.</p><p>He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/adam-schiff-investigation-donald-trump-ed-martin?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Adam Schiff,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Adam Schiff,</a> another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.</p><p>The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.</p><p>Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep.

For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:remarkable Truth Social;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">remarkable Truth Social</a> post for the prosecution of his political enemies.</p><p>“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING.

Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.</p><p>Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.</p><p>Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”</p><h3>An ally in Virginia</h3><p>But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.</p><p>While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.</p><p>Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Lindsey Halligan, special assistant to the president, fixes an earring at the end of an interview outside of the White House, Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2025, in Washington.

And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/politics/ed-martin-letitia-james-brooklyn-new-york-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:home;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">home </a>in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.</p><p>“We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.</p><p>Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.</p><h3>Attention in Maryland</h3><p>Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.</p><p>The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/politics/investigation-john-bolton-indictment?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:John Bolton;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">John Bolton</a>, another Trump political foe.
