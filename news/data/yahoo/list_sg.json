visited his island or flown on his plane, accusing the panel of trying to &quot;protect one public official&quot; -- Trump.</p><p>James&nbsp;Comer, who chairs the committee that will also grill former

&quot;if this committee is serious about learning the truth about Epstein&#39;s trafficking crimes...it would ask (Trump) directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Almost a year after China expanded rare-earth export controls ostensibly aimed at preventing their use by foreign militaries, exporters are still asking a basic question: when does a small magnet turn an everyday product into a controlled item?</p><p>Makers of products ranging from pill boxes, printed billboards, motor components and optical glass are among the growing number of companies that have queried the ‌commerce ministry over whether they require export licences.</p><p>Beijing is expanding export enforcement manpower and imposing compliance nationwide, even as it raises costs for domestic firms and makes it harder for them to ship goods.</p><p>A Reuters ‌review of over 200 public export-control compliance enquiries to China&#39;s commerce ministry between 2019 and the start of this month showed a stark surge after rare-earth controls were tightened last April.</p><p>In the meantime, Washington has eased some export restrictions on products like advanced artificial-intelligence chips during President Donald Trump&#39;s second ​term, after China&#39;s curbs on rare earths exports threatened to hobble global supply chains spanning autos, technology, energy, aerospace, and defence.</p><p>The export controls on both sides are expected to be in sharp focus as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet in Beijing in late March for their second in-person talks since Trump returned to office, setting up a high-stakes test of whether a fragile trade truce between the world&#39;s two largest economies can hold.</p><p>&quot;What we are seeing in China is ... the rapid construction of a comprehensive export-control apparatus designed to weaponize chokepoints across strategic and non-strategic sectors,&quot; said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a Beijing-based managing director at Ankura Consulting. &quot;That the U.S. is reining in some of its controls is a direct acknowledgement of China&#39;s growing leverage.&quot;</p><p>China&#39;s commerce ministry ‌did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>EXPORT COMPLIANCE QUERIES JUMP</p><p>Exporters have flooded the ⁠Chinese commerce ministry&#39;s website with urgent compliance questions: whether magnetic sheets cross rare-earth thresholds; whether gallium nitride chips are restricted; whether ultraviolet medical equipment counts as controlled technology.</p><p>From 2019 through 2024, only 43 export-control compliance enquiries were posted publicly. In 2025 alone, the number jumped to 135, with about 16% of them complaints about issues such as shipment delays and increased regulatory ⁠burdens. The rate of complaints nearly doubled in early 2026.</p><p>The actual number of queries from exporters is likely to be orders of magnitude larger as there are several private channels these companies can use, including contacting provincial and municipal commerce bureaux, many of which do not have public query platforms like the central government&#39;s commerce ministry.</p><p>The official responses to the queries from Chinese exporters have been vague and formulaic, stopping short of confirming whether any individual product, from rare-earth magnets to medical materials, required a licence.</p><p>The enforcement push is also legal ​and ​bureaucratic. Since China enacted its Export Control Law in October 2020, it has introduced or expanded export control measures 29 times, compared ​to just six times between 2015-2020.</p><p>Recruitment documents show 45 commerce ministry posts available in this ‌year&#39;s national civil-service examination could be assigned to export-control-related work, compared with 11 such vacancies in both 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Dozens of provincial and municipal governments have organised compliance seminars and policy briefings over the past year, while Beijing has convened national export-control work conferences bringing officials from across the country to the capital.</p><p>Beijing&#39;s October 2025 revision to its rare-earth export-control regime reflected lessons from the U.S. Foreign Direct Product Rule, which allows Washington to assert jurisdiction over certain foreign-made goods produced with American technology.</p><p>&quot;China&#39;s use of rare earths as leverage is completely learned from the West - especially the U.S.,&quot; said Li Xing, professor at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, a think tank in Guangzhou.</p><p>China dominates the processing of rare earths, the conversion of ore into refined oxides and metals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence systems, a chokepoint deeper in the supply chain than mining itself.</p><p>Its new licensing system reaches into processing and downstream incorporation.</p><p>&quot;This is not just a ‌supply chain shortage. This is economic warfare,&quot; said Nick Myers, chief executive of U.S. rare-earth startup Phoenix Tailings.</p><p>PACE OF U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS SLOWS</p><p>During ​Trump&#39;s first term and under President Joe Biden, the United States rapidly expanded export controls targeting China.</p><p>Annual China-related additions to the Entity List, which ​requires U.S. exporters to obtain licences, often reviewed under a presumption of denial, surged from 47 in 2018 ​to 227 in 2020, reaching a record 257 in 2024, according to a Reuters analysis.</p><p>Since Trump&#39;s return to office, that trajectory has reversed. China-related Entity List additions fell to 131 in ‌2025, roughly half the previous year&#39;s pace.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Pentagon briefly published, then withdrew, ​an updated Military End User list that would have added Chinese ​tech giants Alibaba and Baidu while removing a couple of memory chipmakers.</p><p>The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department&#39;s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official said the list was removed as it may require changes based on new information and that an updated list would be published, without further elaborating.</p><p>The moderation has drawn criticism from bipartisan U.S. lawmakers, who have faulted the administration for ​approving certain <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nvidia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Nvidia</a> AI chip exports and cutting BIS funding.</p><p>A Nvidia spokesperson said in ‌a statement that criticism of the current administration&#39;s decision to greenlight these semiconductor shipments to China was unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors.</p><p>&quot;America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and ​approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America&#39;s lead in AI,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who criticised Biden-era controls, said last year that &quot;export control was ​a failure&quot; and that Trump &quot;realises it&#39;s exactly the wrong goal.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)</p></div></article></div>",

John Cornyn in their increasingly contentious Republican Senate primary race.</p><p>Paxton’s campaign <a href=\"https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/2027101165553586430?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:released a video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">released a video</a> from his daughter Mattie Hayworth in which she says: “My dad is a really good guy. Loves God. He loves his family and he loves this country.”</p><p>She also wrote a <a href=\"https://texasscorecard.com/opinion/hayworth-my-dad-is-ken-paxton-and-im-setting-the-record-straight/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:column;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">column</a> for the conservative publication Texas Scorecard published Thursday.</p><p>“My dad is not perfect; none of us are. But he is a man of deep faith, genuine love for his family, and an unrelenting commitment to doing right by the people of Texas,” Hayworth writes.</p><p>The family support comes as the contest between Paxton, Cornyn and Rep. Wesley Hunt has grown increasingly heated leading up to the March 3 primary. It’s particularly notable given past claims that Paxton <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/27/politics/ken-paxton-impeachment-texas-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:asked a campaign donor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">asked a campaign donor</a> to hire someone with whom he was having an affair, allegations that were cited by the Texas House in impeaching Paxton in 2023. He was later acquitted by the Texas Senate.</p><p>His wife, Angela Paxton – a state senator and longtime political adviser – accused him of adultery and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/politics/ken-paxton-divorce-texas-senate?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed for divorce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">filed for divorce</a> last year on “biblical grounds.”</p><p>A Paxton adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said the ad featuring Hayworth was filmed before Cornyn released an ad that has drawn wide attention, though Paxton’s campaign intended for its video to respond to Cornyn’s.</p><p>The Cornyn Lonestar Victory Fund, a joint effort between the Cornyn campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leveled a series of attacks against Paxton. CNN could not verify all of the ad’s claims.</p><p>“It’s voting time, so let’s cut through the bulls**t,” the ad’s narrator begins. “Crooked Ken Paxton cheated on his wife. She’s divorcing him on ‘biblical grounds.’”</p><p>“Now, think of the Paxton dirty deeds we don’t know about yet,” the narrator adds.</p><p>In the op-ed published Thursday, Hayworth accused Paxton’s opponents of “ugly attacks” on her father.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“When his opponent can’t win on policy, he goes after character,” Hayworth wrote. “But anyone who has spent real time with my dad knows that the attacks bear no resemblance to the man they claim to describe.”</p><p>Paxton has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/ken-paxton-texas-senate-republican-primary?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:survived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">survived</a> a series of controversies throughout his time as the state’s attorney general, including a felony securities fraud investigation that was ultimately settled.</p><p>“We overcame them all,” he told reporters last week.</p><p>Cornyn and his allies have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/18/politics/texas-senate-primary-cornyn-paxton-hunt-crockett-talarico?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warned nominating Paxton;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">warned nominating Paxton</a> to the top of the Republican ticket in November would endanger GOP chances in the traditionally red-voting state.</p><p>“We will have an election day massacre,” Cornyn said earlier this month. “If Ken Paxton is at the top of the ticket, we risk losing the Senate seat, losing the majority in the House of Representatives, and it will take a toll on everybody in the ballot.”</p><p>In a statement, Paxton said, “Unlike John Cornyn, who’s become a desperate shell of a man clinging to power, my campaign is not about attacking someone else’s family. It’s about protecting America.”</p><p>The three-way GOP field could result in a late May runoff between the top two finishers if no candidate is able to clear the 50% vote threshold next week.</p><p>A University of Houston Hobby School poll conducted in late January found Paxton leading the field among likely voters. Paxton earned 38% support compared to 31% for Cornyn and Hunt at 17%. 12% of those polled said they were undecided.</p><p>One of the biggest question marks in the race is whether President Donald Trump will decide to support a candidate. Trump, who is traveling to Corpus Christi on Friday, has so far withheld an endorsement.</p><p>“I just haven’t made a decision on that race yet. It’s got a ways to go,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “They’ve all supported me. They’re all good, and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens. But I support all three involved.”</p><p>CNN’s Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

of the pandemic, although her popularity in New Zealand had soured in the months before she stood down from politics in January 2023.</p><p>Since then she had been living with her family in the United States, where she had been working at Harvard University.</p><p>But a spokesperson for Ardern told national broadcaster RNZ on Thursday they were now &quot;basing themselves out of Australia&quot;.</p><p>&quot;They have work there, and it brings the added bonus of more time back home in New Zealand,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>Ardern and her husband were seen scoping out properties for sale in Sydney&#39;s beachside northern suburbs of Freshwater and Curl Curl, property website realestate.com.au said.</p><p>An international hero of progressive politics, Ardern steered New Zealand through natural disasters, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2019 Christchurch mosque massacre.</p><p>But plaudits abroad did not always match her support at home, which dipped towards the end of her second term in office driven by deteriorating economic conditions and a backlash to her government&#39;s strict Covid policies.</p><p>The former prime minister is now among thousands of her compatriots to make the move to Australia.</p><p>The most recent data from Stats NZ showed 48,000 people had moved from New Zealand between November 2024 and the same month in 2025.</p><p>Although New Zealand ranks highly in lists of the most desirable places in the world to live and work, in recent years the record numbers of arrivals have been matched by departures.</p><p>Commentators have blamed slow economic growth, high living costs and a housing crisis that has made it difficult for young New Zealanders to get on the property ladder.</p><p>oho/msp</p></div></article></div>",

New research says it&#39;s a tale as old as time.</p><p>A study out Thursday in Science argues that Neanderthal men and human women were particularly inclined to mate, a sexual habit that offers insight into the evolution of the modern human genome.</p><p>In 2010 scientists reconstructed the Neanderthal genome -- blockbuster research that allowed for analysis making clear that the species interbred.</p><p>Most people living today have some residual fragments of DNA from our ancient evolutionary cousins.</p><p>Research indicates both groups descended from a population living in Africa some million years ago.</p><p>They eventually diverged, with anatomically modern humans evolving in Africa, and Neanderthals migrating across Eurasia.</p><p>But over hundreds of millenia, human migrations resulted in interbreeding, researchers say.</p><p>Yet humans have little to no Neanderthal DNA on our X chromosomes -- one of two human chromosomes that determines an embryo&#39;s sex.</p><p>That was assumed to be the result of a natural selection.</p><p>The genes were biologically &quot;toxic&quot; to humans, researchers hypothesized, and eventually purged out -- in essence, the children who inherited those traits might not have lived to pass them on.</p><p>But the new study from geneticists at the University of Pennsylvania suggests the phenomenon has more social origins, and were actually the result of &quot;long-standing mating preferences.&quot;</p><p>The team analyzed modern human DNA preserved in Neanderthals, and found an abundance on the X chromosome -- the mirror opposite of humans.</p><p>That result allowed them to rule out that reproduction between the species was incompatible.</p><p>Instead the gene flow &quot;occurred predominantly between Neanderthal males and anatomically modern human females,&quot; said Alexander Platt, a senior research scientist on the study.</p><p>Since females have two X chromosomes and males just one, the math adds up: If Neanderthal males and modern human females were mating, more Neanderthal X chromosomes would enter the human gene pool, and vice versa.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Researchers said that sex-biased migration could also offer clues. But ancient mating habits &quot;provided the simplest explanation,&quot; Platt said.</p><p>The larger &quot;why&quot; is unknown: Neanderthal men and modern human women might have been mating by choice, or violence and coercion could have been involved.</p><p>Researchers say they now hope to analyze the development of this mating pattern.</p><p>Possibilities include probing gender dynamics within Neanderthal society, or migration habits -- perhaps males were likely to leave their societies while females stayed with their families, for example.</p><p>mdo/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

ensure its territorial integrity and the safety and security of its citizens,” the Pakistani ministry said.</p><p>The two sides reported widely differing casualty figures. Pakistan claimed that its army killed 72 Afghan Taliban fighters, injuring “many” others, and that multiple Afghan military posts and equipment have been destroyed. Afghanistan however, said eight of its soldiers had been killed and 11 injured.</p><p>Thirteen Afghan civilians, including women and children, were also injured when Pakistani strikes hit a refugee camp in Nangarhar, Afghanistan’s defense ministry said</p><p>Earlier on Thursday evening, Afghanistan’s military launched an offensive against Pakistani positions, calling it a retaliation for Pakistan’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/asia/pakistan-strikes-afghanistan-militant-camps-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:airstrikes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">airstrikes</a> on militant camps across the border in Afghanistan over the weekend that left at least 18 people dead.</p><p>Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry said the retaliatory attacks were occurring along the border in six provinces and that they ended at midnight.</p><p>The Afghan forces released video of military vehicles moving at night, and the sound of heavy gunfire.</p><p>Hamdullah Fitrat, the Taliban government’s deputy spokesman, claimed that Afghan forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers, captured some troops alive and taken 19 Pakistani military outposts, adding that Kabul’s troops were deployed along the “Durand Line,” the 1,600-mile disputed border between the two countries. CNN is unable to independently verify the claims.</p><p>Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar admitted that Pakistan had suffered casulaties but gave much lower figures than the Afghan claims, saying two Pakistani soldiers had been killed and three were injured.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Without pointing to specific claims by Afghanistan, Tarar accused the government in Kabul of “spreading false and baseless propaganda.”</p><p>“After the defeat in the field, the Afghan Taliban regime is resorting to lies and propaganda,” he posted to X.</p><p>The strikes inside Afghanistan carried out by Pakistan over the weekend targeted camps belonging to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/asia/pakistan-taliban-profile-2016?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pakistani Taliban;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Pakistani Taliban</a> – also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – and its affiliates, as well as a group associated with the Islamic State, which Islamabad blames for a series of attacks in Pakistan, the information ministry said Sunday.</p><p>Pakistan has seen weeks of deadly attacks and says it has “conclusive evidence” that they were carried out by militants at the “behest of their Afghanistan based leadership and handlers.”</p><p>A fragile ceasefire between the two countries has been in place <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/14/asia/pakistan-afghanistan-attacks-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:since October;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">since October</a>, following the deadliest wave of cross-border violence in years.</p><p>In a November interview with CNN, Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said his country wanted to “take out” the TTP’s leadership in Afghanistan, stating that it would employ “whatever means are available to us.”</p><p><i>This is a developing story and will be updated.</i></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The sprawling ballroom project has an estimated size of approximately 89,000 square feet, according to lead architect Shalom Baranes. By contrast, the primary White House structure, the Executive Mansion, is just 55,000 square feet.</p><p>Trump has maintained that the project isn’t subject to any oversight and that he should be able to continue with it without any serious scrutiny.</p><p>Thursday’s ruling from senior US District Judge Richard Leon focuses on the Trust’s choice to use the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the project. The judge concluded the law was an an inappropriate tool for the Trust, in part because the White House office for the president’s executive office and the office over his residence – which are managing the ballroom’s construction – aren’t agencies that a court could curtail under the law.</p><p>“Unfortunately for Plaintiff, its challenge fails because the White House office in question is not an ‘agency’ under the APA and because Plaintiff did not bring the <em>ultra vires </em>claim necessary to challenge the President’s statutory authority to complete his construction project with private funds and without congressional approval!” Leon wrote.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Trust, Leon said, raised “novel and weight issues” in the case and could potentially restructure the lawsuit to test the president’s authority in a different legal approach.</p><p>“While we are disappointed that the Court did not issue the preliminary injunction, we were pleased that Judge Leon ruled that the National Trust has standing to bring this lawsuit, as we have asserted from the start,” Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust, said in a statement to CNN.</p><p>“We are also pleased that he encouraged us to amend our complaint – specifically, to assert that the President has acted beyond his statutory authority — and we plan to do so promptly,” Quillen added.</p><p>In a Truth Social post, Trump called the ruling “Great news for America, and our wonderful White House!”</p><p>He added: “The Ballroom construction, which is anticipated to also handle future Inaugurations and large State Visits, is ahead of schedule, and under budget. It will stand long into the future as a symbol to the Greatness of America!”</p><p>The Commission of Fine Arts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/19/politics/trump-white-house-ballroom-commission?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:approved the project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">approved the project</a> after the lawsuit was filed.</p><p>The lawsuit, filed last year after the East Wing had been completely demolished, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/16/politics/white-house-ballroom-lawsuit-tro-hearing?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:forced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">forced</a> the administration to make public details about the project that had otherwise been kept under wraps, including plans for a reimagined two-story East Colonnade revealed in December filings; information about the preservation of existing artifacts from the now-destroyed East Wing; and an expected timeline for construction.</p><p><em>CNN’s Austin Culpepper, Devan Cole, Tierney Sneed, Katelyn Polantz and Kit Maher contributed.</em></p><p><em>This story has been updated with a response from the Trust.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
