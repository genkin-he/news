than a decade (-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung hosted Xi Jinping for their first meeting on Saturday as the Chinese head of state took centre stage and reforged old ties at an Asian summit from which US leader Donald Trump was largely absent.</p><p>The talks on the sidelines of the APEC gathering came on the final day of Xi&#39;s first trip to South Korea in more than a decade and a day after his meeting with Canada&#39;s premier that was a reset of the nations&#39; damaged ties.</p><p>Trump had flown to South Korea for the summit, but promptly jetted home Thursday after sealing a trade war pause with Xi, with the two agreeing to dial down a dispute that has roiled markets and disrupted global supply chains.</p><p>Trump&#39;s departure left the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where he framed Beijing as a responsible power against the chaos unleashed by the United States on the international order.</p><p>Lee welcomed Xi at a grand opening ceremony complete with soldiers wearing traditional garb.</p><p>The visit was the Chinese leader&#39;s first since 2014 and comes after years of strained ties over everything from trade to cultural disputes.</p><p>Lee told Xi he had &quot;long looked forward to meeting you in person&quot; and framed his trip as a reset in relations.</p><p>&quot;As our two countries move from a vertical structure of economic cooperation to a more horizontal and mutually beneficial one, we must work together to build a relationship that delivers shared prosperity,&quot; Lee told Xi, whose vast economy represents South Korea&#39;s largest trading partner.</p><p>Xi, in turn, described China and South Korea as &quot;important neighbours that cannot be moved and also partners that cannot be separated&quot;.</p><p>Lee also pitched China as a partner in South Korea&#39;s efforts to rekindle frayed ties with the North, with which it remains technically at war.</p><p>Stressing the need for &quot;stability&quot; in the region, Lee noted &quot;recent high-level exchanges between China and North Korea&quot; -- a reference to leader Kim Jong Un&#39;s recent attendance at a major military parade in Beijing.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Those meetings, Lee said, &quot;are helping to create conditions for renewed engagement with Pyongyang&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hope that South Korea and China will strengthen strategic communication... and work together to resume dialogue with the North,&quot; Lee told Xi.</p><p>Ahead of Lee and Xi&#39;s meeting, Pyongyang had dismissed Seoul&#39;s hopes for denuclearisation as a &quot;pipedream&quot; which &quot;can never be realized even if it talks about it a thousand times&quot;.</p><p>- Passing the baton -</p><p>Earlier in the day, Lee passed the APEC baton to Xi, who will host next year&#39;s summit in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.</p><p>With the US president absent, the Chinese leader has used APEC to reach out to countries with which Beijing has had frosty relations.</p><p>Xi met on Friday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the event -- the first formal talks between the two countries&#39; leaders since 2017.</p><p>Xi told the Liberal leader he was determined to work together to get relations back on the &quot;right track&quot; and invited Carney to visit China.</p><p>Carney on Saturday described the meeting as a &quot;turning point&quot; in ties between Ottawa and Beijing.</p><p>Canada&#39;s relations with China are among the worst of any Western nation.</p><p>But the two can find common ground as both are at the sharp end of Trump&#39;s tariff onslaught, even after Xi and the US leader&#39;s deal Thursday to dial back tensions.</p><p>Carney said Saturday he had apologised to Trump over an anti-tariff ad featuring former US leader Ronald Reagan that sent the president into a rage, leading him to cancel trade talks and slap additional 10 percent tariffs on Canada.</p><p>Trade talks would restart when the United States was &quot;ready&quot;, Carney said.</p><p>And, he said, he had accepted Xi&#39;s invitation to visit &quot;in the new year&quot;.</p><p>Xi also sat down on Friday with Japan&#39;s premier Sanae Takaichi for the first time since she was appointed in October.</p><p>Takaichi, Japan&#39;s first woman prime minister, has long been seen as a China hawk and has been a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan&#39;s war dead, a site that angers China and South Korea.</p><p>She told Xi that she wanted a &quot;strategic and mutually beneficial relationship&quot;.</p><p>cdl-oho/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”</p><p>But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F31%2Fpolitics%2Fsnap-benefits-november-judge-ruling&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cclay.voytek%40cnn.com%7C589414c2bcbb40be354608de18e8d989%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638975585516164725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cNhFv6G7sCssFEdUcFDqwPnzsvWBNTseezgAeykjQzw%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a partial and short-term fix;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a partial and short-term fix</a>. Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.</p><p>And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.</p><p>“Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”</p><p>“I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who has repeatedly bucked his party and sided with Republicans on the funding bill.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on the shutdown in the US Capitol on October 10. - Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1GTJHBcJ1uJB91yX_2ODtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/06b2dbd59d0314ed63dc9128888ce6d0><noscript><img alt=\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on the shutdown in the US Capitol on October 10. - Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1GTJHBcJ1uJB91yX_2ODtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/06b2dbd59d0314ed63dc9128888ce6d0 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on the shutdown in the US Capitol on October 10. - Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speak to the press at the US Capitol on October 16. - Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ExFjAxhDA3GF9sV8mizEhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e20cc8e85dbe24d858245269fad2cb01><noscript><img alt=\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speak to the press at the US Capitol on October 16. - Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ExFjAxhDA3GF9sV8mizEhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e20cc8e85dbe24d858245269fad2cb01 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speak to the press at the US Capitol on October 16. - Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Privately, lawmakers of both parties have acknowledged in recent days they need to find a way out of the shutdown in the next week or two or else face even more dire consequences, according to interviews with a half-dozen sources.</p><p>And publicly, many are hopeful that the skyrocketing pressure on both Republicans and Democrats will force the two sides to find a deal.</p><p>“There’s going to be a flood of phone calls from people saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, my health care is going to go up by that much?” Sen.

My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”</p><p>Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.</p><p>“I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dFFFVHw2ZTm0MasLZUluhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/df618adc850e92a86e46e5f2a7194ecb><noscript><img alt=\"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dFFFVHw2ZTm0MasLZUluhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/df618adc850e92a86e46e5f2a7194ecb class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.</p><p>As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.</p><p>“People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”</p><p>Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.</p><p>Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.</p><p>In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.</p><p>That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.</p><p>Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ofod1ixEKhDztjDp9b8S.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/be7df60948159a3e7db0431457909dcc><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ofod1ixEKhDztjDp9b8S.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/be7df60948159a3e7db0431457909dcc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.</p><p>“Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”</p><p>But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.</p><p>Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.</p><p>Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out.

And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.</p><p>“The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”</p><p>Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.</p><p>Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.</p><p>“We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president.

With interest rates for home loans falling to their lowest in three years, and more competitive bank loan packages on the market, mortgage loan refinancing activity in Singapore has ratcheted up.</p><p>Since the start of this year, more Housing Board flat owners in particular have made the switch to bank loans to save money as these have become significantly cheaper, local banks and mortgage brokers told The Straits Times.</p><p>Mr Clive Chng, associate director at Redbrick Mortgage Advisory, said fixed- and floating-rate bank loan packages have dropped to between 1.55 per cent and 1.8 per cent in the past six months. In comparison, the HDB concessionary loan rate is 2.6 per cent.</p><p>Lower interest rates have sparked interest from HDB flat owners who had taken higher fixed-rate bank packages in 2022 and 2023, and reached the end of their loan lock-in periods, said Mr Joel Lim, associate director at Dollarback Mortgage.</p><p>Floating-rate packages are typically pegged to the three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average, or Sora, which banks use to price home loan packages.</p><p>For most of 2023, the Sora rate exceeded 3.6 per cent, but in the past week, it has fallen to below 1.4 per cent. As at Oct 30, the three-month Sora was at around 1.34 per cent per annum – the lowest rate in over three years. This could drop further if the US Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates, local inflation stays low, and the Sing dollar remains strong.</p><p>Mr Lim said the last major refinancing wave occurred between 2019 and 2020, when floating rates fell below 1.5 per cent. At the time, refinancing volumes from HDB loans to bank loans jumped by between 35 per cent and 40 per cent year on year.</p><p>Refinancing activity in 2025, particularly from HDB flat owners, has picked up for OCBC, Ms Maryanne Phua, the bank’s head of home loans, said.</p><p>In the first nine months of the year, the number of HDB home owners switching from an HDB loan to an OCBC home loan grew by over 60 per cent compared with the same period last year, she noted.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“Fixed-rate home loans are the preferred choice — nearly nine in 10 HDB homeowners who&nbsp;refinanced opted for them. This reflects a strong desire for certainty, as fixed rates offer stable monthly repayments that make budgeting easier,” she said.</p><p>At DBS Singapore, Ms Chelsea Ling, head of deposits and secured lending of its consumer banking group, also saw a noticeable increase in demand for POSB HDB home loans. The bank did not quantify what this increase was.</p><p>This&nbsp;three-year fixed-rate loan package offers an interest rate of 1.7 per cent or lower, with no penalty for paying down the POSB HDB home loan or selling one’s property within the lock-in period.</p><p>Refinancing from an HDB loan to the POSB HDB home loan would “translate to an estimated&nbsp;$3,600 in first-year savings&nbsp;on a $400,000 loan – enough to cover a round-trip flight from Singapore to Tokyo for a family of three,” Ms Ling said.</p><p>Banks competing to offer attractive refinancing options means that homeowners are spoilt for choice.</p><p>In addition to lower rates, local banks have been offering cash rebates and legal fee subsidies to lower the costs of refinancing. Some home loan packages now come with flexible loan features, such as a free conversion or free repricing option after the first year, which gives borrowers the flexibility to adapt, should interest rates change course.</p><p>Repricing involves switching to a different interest rate package within the same bank. Banks typically provide free switching to a different interest rate package within the same bank after the lock-in period expires.</p><p>According to Redbrick Mortgage Advisory, the most popular loan packages today include a two-year fixed rate loan at 1.48 per cent with free conversion after the first year, and the three-year fixed rate loan at 1.5 per cent.</p><p>But lower rates have not resulted in a spike in private home refinancing in 2025, according to Mortgage Master.</p><p>Mr David Baey, the mortgage broker’s chief executive, noted that instead of refinancing their current mortgages, some clients have opted to sell their existing private home and buy a new one, and are therefore, taking new loans, as they feel upgrading has become more financially manageable.</p><p>With the three-month Sora expected to hover at between 1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent by year-end, the refinancing tailwind could extend into 2026 as home owners continue to take advantage of lower borrowing rates, said Mr Sebastian Sieber, managing director of Cashew Mortgages.</p><p>“That said, the bulk of the rate decline has already occurred. While further declines are possible, they are likely to be modest, given current macroeconomic conditions,” Mr Sieber said.</p><p>Redbrick Mortgage Advisory believes refinancing should remain healthy in 2026, but could moderate from the middle of the year.</p><p>“This is because many borrowers whose loans originated in 2023 and 2024 and had been locked in at 3 per cent to 4 per cent, would have already refinanced at the lower rates,” Mr Chng said.</p><p>“Refinancing from mid-2026 will depend on the prevailing interest rates and the banks’ promotional features and subsidies.”</p><p>Meanwhile, HDB&nbsp;loan refinancing&nbsp;activity is expected to stay steady in 2026, Mr Chng said.</p><p>Some flat owners are cautious about refinancing from HDB loans to bank loans, because once they do so,&nbsp;they cannot switch back to an HDB loan in future. But if interest rates continue to&nbsp;fall, more HDB owners could opt to&nbsp;refinance&nbsp;to bank loans, he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/more-hdb-flat-owners-refinancing-to-cheaper-bank-loans-as-interest-rates-drop-to-3-year-low?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>GYEONGJU, South Korea – The trend towards more global economic fragmentation will likely continue after a “temporary truce” between the US and China, but the rest of the world continues to have agency, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.</p><p>Singapore and other countries are not passive bystanders, he told local media after the conclusion of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit on Nov 1.</p><p>Likening economic fragmentation to global warming, PM Wong said: “We know it’s happening, but we can take actions to mitigate.</p><p>“And likewise, if countries are able to do more like what we did this time with the Apec summit and through other areas of cooperation, if we can all take action together, then we can do something about these structural trends.”</p><p>PM Wong was commenting on the Oct 30 meeting <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/amazing-trump-xi-talks-produce-a-pause-in-us-china-trade-war\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> at the sidelines of Apec which resulted in concessions from both sides on key trade issues such as rare earths and soybeans.</p><p>Describing it as a relief that the meeting took place, PM Wong said some much needed and welcomed guardrails have been placed around the relationship, providing some short-term predictability.</p><p>But their rivalry is likely to continue and fundamental underlying issues have not been resolved, he said.</p><p>In this environment, other economies still have the agency to push frontiers and harmonise standards, PM Wong said.</p><p>He raised the example of the Green Economy Partnership Agreement (Gepa) – a green trade pact which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand had launched negotiations for on the sidelines of the summit.</p><p>Pacts like these have a lot of value because it is easier for like-minded, small trade dependent economies to set new standards and facilitate more economic flows, he said.</p><p>“Then others see it, hopefully others get a little bit of FOMO (fear of missing out), and they say: ‘I want to join in too’,” he said.</p><p>This process is not just theoretical, PM Wong said, raising the example of how Singapore along with Brunei, Chile and New Zealand started the P4 agreement in the past which eventually evolved into <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/6-things-to-know-about-the-trans-pacific-trade-pact-cptpp\"

class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“You see countries applying to join because they see value in it, and we hope to do the same for the Gepa now, with regard to the green economy.”</p><p>More trade and more investments will lead to better jobs for Singaporeans, he said.</p><p>“That’s the tangible benefits from trade, but trade also has a lot of intangible benefits.”</p><p>These include the exchange of ideas and more cultural exchange, which Singaporeans also benefit from, he said.</p><p>Language around trade has changed in recent years, and economic, supply chain and technology security have become increasingly important – meaning more barriers are put up against trade, he said.</p><p>But this year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Wong.</p><p>Following the summit, the leaders of the 21 Apec member economies, including Singapore, issued the Gyeongju Declaration which reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen cooperation and concrete actions to enable economic growth that benefits all.</p><p>This is important for Singapore as it is a trade dependent economy, he added.</p><p>“Trade is not just good to have for us. Trade is our life blood. Trade is existential for us.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 828px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288><noscript><img alt=\"This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RuO_XMEwSSuC6dqKZmBR1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/ae90eb85f3226473dbdb38ce81890288 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>This year’s Apec summit has been beneficial because it has resulted in a consensus which is still generally pro-trade, said PM Lawrence Wong.</figcaption></div></figure><p>Singapore must therefore continue to support Apec and the momentum towards trade and trade liberalisation.</p><p>This means multiple lines of work, including reforming the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and bringing different regional groupings closer together, he said.</p><p>PM Wong spoke about reforming the WTO on Oct 31 at the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM), the highest-level meeting at the annual summit.</p><p>He said then that the collective leadership of Apec’s 21 economies is needed to reform and strengthen the 30-year-old trade body so that it stays effective and relevant.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=c75b6a59-5762-5e25-ac7a-2471240b52e3><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:56% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_0RRatIy4M?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>Singapore has to be realistic about the challenges of such reforms, PM Wong said.</p><p>“We have to keep pushing at this and do our very best to achieve reforms, even if the trajectory may not always move in a linear fashion.</p><p>“Sometimes it’s up and down, sometimes it may curve and bend, but over a period of time, as long as we are moving forward in the right direction, I think that’s already an achievement.”</p><p>Singapore will continue to do so not just by itself but with like-minded countries, he said.</p><div class=caas-iframely data-embed-anchor=cfaeb542-ae5a-5a35-86db-3053ac5b38ba><a data-iframely-url=https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/8NuZeyY8?app=1 data-lazy data-img></a></div><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/global-fragmentation-still-likely-after-trump-xi-meet-but-countries-can-act-to-mitigate-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

generational prohibition on tobacco, the Health Ministry said.</p><p>The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year -- which came into effect on November 1 -- will &quot;protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation&quot;, the ministry said.</p><p>&quot;Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,&quot; it added.</p><p>&quot;The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.&quot;</p><p>The measure also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.</p><p>The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products, applicable to all individuals regardless of age.</p><p>Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).</p><p>A similar generational ban proposed in Britain is still going through the legislative process, while New Zealand -- the first country to enact such a law against smoking -- repealed it in November 2023, less than a year after it was introduced.</p><p>aj/pjm/fox</p></div></article></div>",
