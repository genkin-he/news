runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump said Thursday he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing &quot;on an equal basis&quot; to China and Russia -- an announcement made just minutes before he held a high-stakes summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>The move came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow had successfully tested a nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered underwater drone, in defiance of Washington&#39;s warnings.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump wrote in a social media post.</p><p>Following that announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the weapon tests announced by Putin did not constitute a direct test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia regularly runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to testing nuclear warheads, which the United States last did in 1992, or testing weapons systems capable of carrying atomic warheads.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country, praising his own efforts to do &quot;a complete update and renovation of existing weapons.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Thousands of warheads -</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In total, SIPRI estimates that the nine nuclear-armed countries -- Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea -- possess more than 12,200 warheads.</p><div

we&#39;ve halted it years, many years ago,&quot; he said, adding that it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again because others are testing.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d like to see denuclearization... denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>He claimed &quot;it&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>Trump&nbsp;kept the location and dates for testing vague during the news conference, but said earlier it would &quot;begin immediately.&quot;</p><p>- China defends nuclear ban -</p><p>The Republican president was in South Korea to meet with Xi, with the leaders of the world&#39;s top two economies coming face-to-face for the first time in Trump&#39;s second term.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun later urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban &quot;and take concrete actions to safeguard the global nuclear disarmament.&quot;</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>- Russia&#39;s &#39;Poseidon&#39; drone -</p><p>Putin announced on Wednesday the successful testing of a nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered underwater drone, the second weapons test in days after that of the Burevestnik cruise missile.</p><p>In televised remarks broadcast from a military hospital treating Russian soldiers wounded in Ukraine, Putin said there was &quot;no way to intercept&quot; the torpedo drone dubbed &quot;Poseidon.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Regarding the tests of Poseidon and Burevestnik, we hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Peskov told journalists, including AFP, during a daily briefing on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;This cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test.&quot;</p><p>He implied that Russia would also test nuclear warheads if Trump ordered a live test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>sla/dhw/ane/pbt/rlp/aha</p></div></article></div>",

What isn’t pretty should be handled privately… or so she taught me, and her mom taught her, and so on and so forth. But the page is a place of connection. If I’m not fully present here, then what’s the point?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To put it bluntly, my organs are falling out. That’s a slight exaggeration. “Descending” is more accurate. However I frame it, it’s a disconcerting thought. My uterus, well, there’s a sign on that one that reads, “We’re done here!” But my bladder and my rectum, though performing their functions poorly, still seem necessary. I can’t have them planning their escapes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/husband-hearse-death-halloween-decoration_n_68f7bf30e4b0dbac45915c5d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Screamed When I Saw What Was Parked In Our Driveway.

Then I Learned My Husband Had Bought It.</a></strong></p><p><span>The news of my organs descending surprised me. Like many women following childbirth, I’ve struggled with “peezing” (a word contributed by Liz Lemon from “30 Rock”) and other mild forms of stress incontinence for a long time. But since my mid-40s, those problems have intensified alongside a more troubling inability to defecate completely.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So after probing in hard-to-reach places, a urogynecologist pronounces me prolapsed. According to a handout my doctor gave me&nbsp; by the American Urogynecologic Society, </span><a href=\"https://www.voicesforpfd.org/pelvic-organ-prolapse/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=6110279%2047&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADnw6TTmxw29Gm09-bivaxmjeyB4t&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpOfHBhAxEiw%20Am1SwEpakHT5P_zc6efgePsrh-R1MzRs68zTi821f6Q0qUShdC539CV5eJxoC1isQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:pelvic organ prolapse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>pelvic organ prolapse</span></a>, or POP,<span> “occurs when the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue weaken or tear. This causes the pelvic organs to fall downward into the vagina, similar to a hernia. Women may feel or see tissue coming out of the opening of their vagina as this progresses.” </span></p><p><span>POP can happen for a variety of reasons, among them muscle and nerve damage from pregnancy and childbirth, hormonal changes related to menopause, constant straining due to constipation, repeatedly lifting heavy objects and genetic predisposition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To investigate the possible relationship between my prolapsing organs and my constipation, my doctor suggests that I undergo what feels like a new level of humiliation called a defecography. It’s not like a colonoscopy, where you theoretically sleep through the entire thing. In this case, medical professionals watch you poop while you are alert and fully present, live and on-camera. The test reveals whether there is some anatomical reason why you can’t eliminate properly.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-ad-voiceover-actors-police_n_68fcfec8e4b011e8088689fa?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">ICE Is Offering Voiceover Actors Like Me An Insane Payday — But Look At What They Want Us To Say</a></strong></p><p><span>I wonder if it’s worth it. Maybe I should just embrace my “pooping problem,” as my youngest calls it, and limp along without additional interventions. I can just live with the prolapses for now, right? It seems like the easiest and most peaceful route sometimes — just settling. But we all want more, don’t we? We want true healing. We want to feel better. We want to be fully restored.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I remain stubbornly curious about what </span><em><span>could </span></em><span>be, and schedule the test. But I give myself&nbsp;</span><span>permission to say “no” the morning of — “no” when I get there and see what awaits me, “no” when they ask me to… you get the idea.

You suck down a bunch of barium and load yourself up vaginally with barium paste. The nurse then pages the radiologist: “The defo </span><em><span>(that’s me) </span></em><span>is ready.” She notices I’m listening to her —&nbsp;</span><em><span>What else would I be doing?&nbsp;</span></em><span>— and looks a little embarrassed. She apologizes quickly for referring to me as “defo,” saying it’s only to prepare the radiologist for what he’s about to do. I guess referring to me as a person is too much work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then the radiologist arrives, explains the process, and inserts a large amount of barium paste into my rectum via syringe. If you have other anal issues like I do…a fissure, hemorrhoids, that last part is especially unpleasant. It’s hard not to feel violated unless your radiologist is gifted with an unusual amount of finesse. Mine was not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-hospice-coping-dying-parent_n_68dc0865e4b0d2dd31581907?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You</a></strong></p><p><span>Next is the fun part. You sit on an elevated platform sporting a special commode. With the radiologist and nurse next to you, you defecate on camera and on command. The radiologist stares at a screen to judge how well you eliminate and gathers evidence revealing why you cannot void completely. In my case, he found that my uterus descends and pinches off part of my rectum when I bear down, so I can only partially evacuate. Hooray? Maybe. I cry all the way home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I see my urogynecologist several weeks later, she’s elated: “I’m so glad that I can do something to help you!” </span><em><span>She’s a good doctor. </span></em><span>She explains that she’d like to insert a silicone device called a pessary up into my vagina. It’s designed to hold up my uterus and prevent it from pinching off my rectum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The pessary looks like a mushroom with a top that secures via suction and a long stem that extends down to my vaginal opening. Once I’ve assumed the position, she requests that I ready myself and relax. </span><em><span>That doesn’t bode well. </span></em><span>With significant force, she installs the medieval workhorse. According to the nurses, she “places” the pessary, but what I experience feels more like a pain-inducing shove. I arrive home feeling like I’ve got a tampon protruding and a little askew. I’m supposed to function like this for 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, the pessary changes nothing. The pooping problem persists. My urogynecologist explains that she could still surgically fix the prolapses, pin up or remove my uterus, in hopes that stooling would improve. She looks at me: “What do </span><em><span>you </span></em><span>think we should do?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fundamental-christian-university-job-spank-kids_n_68fe1ed8e4b0049ce5fd2e27?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">I Lost My Job Because I Wouldn’t Let My Employer Hit My Toddler</a></strong></p><p><span>My internal response is paradoxical. One part of me screams, </span><em><span>What!?! YOU are supposed to be the expert!

Not really, and I hope not. But this is where we all are a lot of time. In between. In process. Unresolved. We all wander around hurting sometimes and can’t fix it. We’re all trying to make meaning of suffering while we wait for change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But wherever this path takes me, I’m done with pretty and private. I’m done with the societal expectation that women’s bodies should look the same regardless of the trauma they have sustained, that aging should be invisible.

It also conducted about 10 combined exercise planning meetings.</p><p>To ensure safety and prevent mid-air collisions, aircraft was also separated into blocks of airspace at different heights, and there were clear processes for transit lanes, said Lieutenant Colonel Dai Jing, who is ops officer for 6 Div/HQ SS.</p><p>“We made sure everybody knew their roles very well and was well-coordinated, such that when we brought everything together and executed it together, it was safe, but also operationally to standard,” she added.</p><p>The SAF also trialled the use of rapid 3D-mapping technology to help its tactical troops achieve near real-time visualisation of the urban environment they were operating in.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height:

valuable, given that it is not something that can be done in Singapore, added MAJ Chin, who is commanding officer of 23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery.</p><p>MAJ Lee, the F-16 pilot, concurred, noting that Shoalwater Bay had urban operations training facilities, jungle terrain, as well as mountainous areas, which allowed the RSAF and army to work towards shared objectives.</p><p>“The challenge is mainly that we don’t have a lot of experience with the army, so there were a lot of communications issues at the start, but then we worked through them and sorted out our differences during the exercise,” he said.</p><p>He added: “It’s a good opportunity for us, because it’s one of the rare exercises that we get to interact with the army controllers.</p><p>“So we get to learn their lingo, run through the processes with them and improve on those so we get familiar with how to support them in their missions.”</p><p><a

up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.</p><p>Cuomo <a

to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.</p><p>Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism and despair about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-preparations?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani</a>.

The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>And in a <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters</a> released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 18%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.</p><p>With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23><noscript><img alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Voters cast their ballots during New York's early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York's Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.</p><p>“We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”</p><p>Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.</p><p>The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).</p><p>Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.</p><p>In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:laughed with a radio host;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">laughed with a radio host</a> who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11.

In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.</p><p>“I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/politics/andrew-cuomo-resigns?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cuomo resigned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Cuomo resigned</a> in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.</p><p>He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep.

Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”</p><h3>Embracing his inner influencer</h3><p>As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.</p><p>Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.</p><p>“It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.</p><p>Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.</p><p>“He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571><noscript><img alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.</p><p>At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.</p><h3>Experience, experience, experience</h3><p>Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.</p><p>Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-police-nypd-defund?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mamdani’s police reform agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mamdani’s police reform agenda</a> would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.</p><p>The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.</p><p>On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.</p><p>“You need experience. You need the ability.

analysts said, and drew cautious optimism on the streets of Beijing (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>A rare meeting between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping has succeeded in temporarily stabilising US-China relations, analysts said on Thursday, with the talks drawing cautious optimism on the streets of Beijing.</p><p>A beaming Trump hailed the talks as a &quot;great success&quot;, while Xi said China had reached a &quot;consensus&quot; with the United States on trade and economic issues.</p><p>Beijing and Washington have been locked in a blistering trade war, encompassing everything from rare earths to soybeans and port fees, which has rocked markets for months.</p><p>&quot;Although there hasn&#39;t been a complete agreement, at least in the short term, there&#39;s been a suspension of tariff increases,&quot; 35-year-old media worker Yan told AFP outside a shopping mall in China&#39;s capital.</p><p>Dylan Loh from Singapore&#39;s Nanyang Technological University said the meeting was &quot;significant&quot; because it tackled a range of both longstanding and newly emerged roadblocks in the trade relationship.</p><p>&quot;The conciliatory words used by both leaders are important, as they signal that there is room to steer the relationship back toward a more normal footing,&quot; Loh told AFP.</p><p>Both sides appear to have moved on key sticking points.</p><p>A decision by China to suspend certain export restrictions on rare earths &quot;did a lot of magic&quot;, and Washington easing fentanyl-related tariffs &quot;helps plenty too&quot;, said Lim Tai Wei, professor and East Asia expert at Japan&#39;s Soka University.</p><p>Xi&#39;s language with Trump struck a &quot;notably constructive&quot; tone, said Yue Su of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</p><p>&quot;While structural competition remains evident... both leaders appear willing to find common ground and stabilise the relationship,&quot; Su told AFP.</p><p>- Long-term concerns? -</p><p>Beijing residents told AFP on Thursday they hoped to see a knock-on effect from the talks.</p><p>Gym owner Ma Ning said she thought the meeting improved &quot;very tense&quot; relations between the two countries.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;Good relations between the two sides are good for China,&quot; the 30-year-old said, adding she hoped the meeting would improve China&#39;s &quot;sluggish economy&quot;.</p><p>Media worker Yan hoped to see the price of regular goods go down after the tariff reductions.</p><p>But he worried Trump&#39;s &quot;unstable&quot; personality might undermine longer-term solutions.</p><p>While the outcomes from Thursday&#39;s meeting were positive, analysts said there were &quot;no surprises&quot;, especially with the two leaders avoiding more sensitive topics.</p><p>Trump said Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory, was not discussed.</p><p>&quot;By the time the two sides meet again, US-China negotiations will likely enter truly deep waters,&quot; the EIU&#39;s Su said.</p><p>&quot;Issues such as Taiwan, market access, and national security will test how much genuine willingness both sides have to pressure the other into making concessions on their own priorities.&quot;</p><p>Either country could also decide, at some point, to walk back on the specific decisions announced on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;There is the issue of one or both sides changing their minds or accusing the other side of not acting in good faith,&quot; said Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve seen this before... in recent years,&quot; Chong told AFP.</p><p>&quot;Trump also appears to prefer negotiating and renegotiating to keep interlocutors on the back foot,&quot; he said.</p><p>isk-sam/reb/pbt</p></div></article></div>",
