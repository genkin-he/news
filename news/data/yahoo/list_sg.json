June 27, 2024. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Che Pan and Wen-Yee Lee</p><p>BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant, according to a letter addressed to its customers that was reviewed by Reuters, which could exacerbate a supply squeeze that is worrying automakers worldwide.</p><p>The letter, dated October 29 and signed by Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger, said the October 26 suspension affecting its plant in Dongguan, in southern China&#39;s Guangdong province, was &quot;a direct consequence of the local management&#39;s recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia has been locked in a dispute with its Chinese unit after the Dutch government took control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner Wingtech Technology on September 30. It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s Chinese unit had resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been in foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS</p><p>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the European-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>&quot;While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>&quot;Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wingtech declined to comment.</p><p>A Dutch government spokesperson referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention &quot;concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company&#39;s day-to-day operations&quot;.</p><p>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, &quot;to work toward a constructive solution,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said after a meeting with Nexperia management on Friday that they are working toward a &quot;diplomatic breakthrough&quot; to resolve the situation, but in the meantime they are looking at unspecified short- and medium-term measures to relieve European industry.</p><p>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION</p><p>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p>On October 4, China&#39;s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a &quot;war room&quot; to monitor the situation.</p><p>Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original price, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p><p>(Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Toby Sterling.

He’d overcome so many challenges to get there: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and difficulty connecting with other kids. As he matured, he gained confidence by participating in cross-country running, drama and debate. He developed a rapport with his peers by listening more and talking less. When he flew to college, he left behind friends from high school, summer jobs and youth groups. He was ready academically and had even earned a merit scholarship.</p><p>Henry arrived early to hike with other incoming freshmen. When I met him on campus the following week during his orientation, he introduced me to his new classmates. I joined them for a meal in the dining hall, attended a presentation for parents and helped him get settled.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-hospice-coping-dying-parent_n_68dc0865e4b0d2dd31581907?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Here Is What No One Tells You About Watching Your Wonderful Dad Slowly Slipping Away In Front Of You</a></strong></p><div class=\"caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy\" data-src><blockquote class=caas-blockquote><p><strong><em>If you believe in deeply personal journalism — the kind that connects us in our hardest, most honest moments — please consider </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:becoming a HuffPost member today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong><em>becoming a HuffPost member today</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p></blockquote></div><p>On Friday, when it was time for me to leave, I placed my hands around Henry’s middle, pressed my right cheek to his chest, closed my eyes and squeezed.

He was an ineffable combination: quirky and clumsy, brilliant and handsome, honest and kind. As a young boy, he was obsessed with collecting rocks and would quickly fall behind whenever we hiked. Once his pockets were bulging, he’d store them inside his tucked shirt until his belly grew large. We’d stop and start until we agreed on the number he could keep. One summer, he filled an entire duffle bag with stones before returning home from camp.</p><p>In elementary school, he constantly misplaced things: his backpack, jacket, lunchbox or violin. We’d find them everywhere except his classroom. Like an absent-minded professor, he wore his shirts inside out or backward or both, and he rarely brushed his hair. He was a vegetarian, and his favorite meal was chana masala followed by dulce de leche ice cream. He always hugged you twice when he said goodbye.</p><p>As he grew older, Henry became interested in public affairs. He loved reading about political corruption and arguing the merits of ranked choice voting. He spent hours on Reddit and shared funny memes I never understood. He was happiest in the company of other teenagers and attended youth group meetings and conferences, even when he didn’t know anyone. He had a wonderful open-mouthed smile and connected to many teens who needed a friend. Henry created his own butterfly effect by weaving laughter and light into the lives of others. We’ll never know how many.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 474px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:75%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Henry on his 18th birthday.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lI28XKiOp71HkQ6.qawiCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzQ-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/376e4b96f19843e8b87290e37d35a299><noscript><img alt=\"Henry on his 18th birthday.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lI28XKiOp71HkQ6.qawiCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05MzQ-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/376e4b96f19843e8b87290e37d35a299 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Henry on his 18th birthday. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Elizabeth Kopple</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>***</p><p><em>It’s been about a year since Henry died, and I’ve only started to process the enormity of his death.</em></p><p>Our family has spent these months as a close-knit unit, seeking therapy, attending loss groups, and passing time with loved ones. Acquaintances reveal tragedies from their pasts, and I’m more attuned to the sadness of strangers. I’ve connected with over a dozen grieving parents in my support groups, each with a heart-wrenching story. We understand and accept each other’s losses in a way no one else can.</p><p>Before Henry died, I didn’t understand the all-pervading nature of grief. It’s the background noise I hear all day long — a constant hum — reminding me that Henry is dead. Even if I put on a colorful dress, straighten my hair and apply makeup, I’m still brokenhearted. I don’t want to hear that I must be recovering because I look well.</p><p>It helps when people acknowledge that his death is a catastrophe, that nothing will ever be the same for those who knew and loved him. My best moments are when people share a loving memory of my son and I know they haven’t forgotten him.</p><p>***</p><p><em>I’m still living, but at a lower volume.</em></p><p>Every day, I move forward knowing that Henry will not. I avoid large celebrations, go walking with friends, host small family brunches and summon my best memories.</p><p>Mostly, I focus on the well-being of my younger son and only living child. This past year, I made sure he had access to grief therapy, support groups and academic assistance to complete high school from home. He spent time tending our garden, experimenting in the kitchen, and visiting cousins and friends. He wrote and delivered a beautiful speech at Henry’s “celebration of life” event in the spring.</p><p>Unbelievably, he’s starting college this fall in Washington, D.C., more than 2,000 miles from where we live — exactly a year after Henry started college.</p><p>He’s excited to study, live in the dorms, explore the city — in short, live the life of a college freshman.</p><p>There is no excitement for Chuck and me, just dread.</p><p>We struggled with his decision.

for nearly $1,000 a cup, a cafe in Dubai is offering the world&#39;s most expensive coffee, brewed from Panamanian beans sold at a premium price.</p><p>The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world&#39;s tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.</p><p>&quot;We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,&quot; said Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering.</p><p>Located in an industrial neighbourhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve &quot;around 400 cups&quot; of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.</p><p>For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavours reminiscent of tea.</p><p>&quot;There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavours like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,&quot; said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s like honey, delicate and sweet,&quot; he said.</p><p>Dubai notched a Guinness record for the world&#39;s most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.</p><p>The new record staggered some people, though residents also said it was par for the course for the desert city with a luxury lifestyle.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s very shocking but at the same time, it&#39;s Dubai,&quot; said Ines, who did not give her last name.</p><p>&quot;For wealthy people, it&#39;s just another experience they can boast about,&quot; added another resident, Maeva.</p><p>The Julith cafe bought its beans at an auction in Panama after a tough battle that lasted many hours and drew hundreds of bids.</p><p>It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.</p><p>Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.</p><p>Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the &quot;Nido 7 Geisha&quot; beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama&#39;s Baru volcano.</p><p>But the cafe said it does not plan to share its treasure, beyond a small amount reserved for Dubai&#39;s ruling family.</p><p>ml/saa/hme/amj/jw</p></div></article></div>",

that could boost the GOP’s chances of winning two additional seats in next year’s elections and aid President Donald Trump’s efforts to hold on to a slim congressional majority.</p><p>The action by the Ohio Redistricting Commission came as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/virginia-democrats-redistricting-spanberger?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Virginia’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Virginia’s</a> Democratic-led General Assembly advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that could pave the way for redistricting in the state ahead of congressional midterm elections next year. The Senate on Friday passed a resolution that would allow lawmakers to temporarily bypass a bipartisan redistricting commission and gerrymander their maps. The House had advanced it Wednesday.</p><p>Trump has been urging Republican-led states to reshape their US House districts in an attempt to win more seats. But unlike in other states, Ohio’s redistricting was required by the state constitution because the current districts were adopted after the 2020 census without bipartisan support.</p><p>Ohio joins Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers already have revised their congressional districts.</p><p>Democrats have been pushing back. California voters are deciding Tuesday on a redistricting plan passed by the Democratic-led legislature.</p><p>The political parties are in an intense battle. Democrats need to gain just three seats in next year’s election to win control of the House and gain the power to impede Trump’s agenda.</p><p>In Ohio, Republicans already hold 10 of 15 congressional seats. The new map could boost Republican chances in already competitive districts currently held by Democratic Reps. Greg Landsman in Cincinnati and Marcy Kaptur near Toledo. Kaptur won a 22nd term last year by about 2,400 votes, or less than 1 percentage point, in a district carried by Trump. Landsman was reelected with more than 54% of the vote.</p><h3>Ohio residents criticize new map</h3><p>Ohio’s commission had faced a Friday deadline to adopt a new map, or else the task would have fallen to the GOP-led legislature, which could have crafted districts even more favorable to Republicans. But any redistricting bill passed by the legislature could have been subject to an initiative petition campaign from opponents seeking to force a public referendum on the new map.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The uncertainty of that legislative process provided commissioners of both parties with some incentive for compromise. All seven commissioners — five Republicans and two Democrats — voted for the new map.</p><p>But Ohio residents who testified to commissioners Friday denounced the new districts. Julia Cattaneo, who wore a shirt saying “gerrymandering is cheating,” said the new map is gerrymandered more for Republicans than the one it is replacing and is not the sort of compromise needed.</p><p>“Yes, you are compromising — your integrity, honor, duty and to represent Ohioans,” she said.</p><p>Added resident Scott Sibley: “This map is an affront to democracy, and you should all — every one of you — be ashamed.”</p><p>Republican state Auditor Keith Farber, a member of the commission, defended the map during a testy exchange with one opponent. Because many Democrats live in cities and many Republicans in rural areas, he said there was no way to draw a map creating eight Republican and seven Democratic districts — as some had urged — without splitting cities, counties and townships.</p><h3>Virginia Democrats point at Trump to defend redistricting</h3><p>Virginia is represented in the US House by six Democrats and five Republicans. Democratic lawmakers haven’t unveiled their planned new map, nor how many seats they are trying to gain, but said their moves are necessary to respond to the Trump-inspired gerrymandering in Republican-led states.</p><p>“Our voters are asking to have that voice. They’re asking that we protect democracy, that we not allow gerrymandering to happen throughout the country, and we sit back,” said Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola.</p><p>The proposed constitutional amendment would let lawmakers temporarily bypass a bipartisan commission and redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The measure would still need to pass the General Assembly again next year, then go before voters in a statewide referendum.</p><p>The developments come as Virginia holds statewide elections Tuesday, where all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are on the ballot. Democrats would need to keep their slim majority in the lower chamber to advance the constitutional amendment next year.</p><p>Republican Sen. Mark Obenshain said Democrats were ignoring the will of voters who had overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan redistricting commission.</p><p>“Heaven forbid that we actually link arms and work together on something,” Obenshain said. “What the voters of Virginia said is, ‘We expect redistricting to be an issue that we work across the aisle on, that we link arms on.’”</p><p>But Democratic Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, who has long championed the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission, noted the panel still would be in charge of redistricting after the 2030 census.</p><p>“We’re not trying to end the practice of fair maps,” he said. “We are asking the voters if, in this one limited case, they want to ensure that a constitutional-norm-busting president can’t break the entire national election by twisting the arms of a few state legislatures.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

live explosions in a directive that has provoked global tension, as well as some confusion.</p><p>Asked whether he meant conducting explosive tests, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, including from AFP: &quot;I am not going to say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ll find out very soon, but we&#39;re going to do some testing, yeah, and other countries do it. If they&#39;re going to do it, we&#39;re going do it,&quot; he said on his way for a weekend at his golf resort in Florida.</p><p>No country other than North Korea has conducted an explosive nuclear weapon test for decades.&nbsp;Russia and China have not carried out such tests since the 1990s and the last US one was in 1992.</p><p>The 79-year-old Republican first made his surprise testing announcement by social media post on Thursday, minutes before entering a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>The announcement came in the wake of Russia saying it had tested a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable torpedo, as well as a new cruise missile.</p><p>Iran, which has been in conflict with the United States for years over its controversial nuclear projects, called Trump&#39;s directive &quot;regressive and irresponsible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>Japanese atomic bomb survivors group Nihon Hidankyo sent a letter of protest to the US embassy in Japan.</p><p>The order &quot;directly contradicts the efforts by nations around the world striving for a peaceful world without nuclear weapons and is utterly unacceptable,&quot; the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group said in the letter obtained by AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Pretty responsible&#39;&nbsp;-</p><p>Amid expressions of concern abroad and among some in the US Congress, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said &quot;resuming testing is a pretty responsible&quot; policy.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly.&quot; He too did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><p>But China&#39;s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through a spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Russia pushed back against any idea that its recent weapon systems tests could justify a return to live test explosions.</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live detonation tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Russian stockpile of deployed and stored warheads is 4,309, compared to 3,700 for the United States and 600 for China -- figures that don&#39;t take into account hundreds of other warheads scheduled for dismantling.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992.</p><p>Its two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II make it the only country to have used the weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W.
