behalf, to take climate action at home and abroad.&quot;</p><p>She pointed to the work of the 24-state &quot;US Climate Alliance&quot; that have slashed emissions by a quarter relative to 2005 while growing their economies.</p><p>Because the Paris accord requires a one-year notice period for withdrawal, the United States remains a party for a few more months.</p><p>But Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who was also on the call, said it appeared unlikely the administration would send an official delegation to COP, given it had not put in embassy support for the Americans

major powers (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>US President Donald Trump landed back in Washington Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued just before Trump -- who boasts frequently about being a peace president --&nbsp;went into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>But Trump&#39;s announcement left much unanswered -- chiefly about whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions, something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>It appeared to alarm key US foe Iran, which criticized the directive as &quot;irresponsible.&quot;</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said the US nuclear arsenal needed to be tested to ensure it actually &quot;functions properly,&quot; but did not elaborate on what type of tests Trump had ordered.</p><p>The president&#39;s statement &quot;speaks for itself,&quot; Vance told reporters at the White House.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an important part of American national security to make sure that this nuclear arsenal we have actually functions properly, and that&#39;s part of a testing regime,&quot; he added.</p><p>Trump&#39;s statement nevertheless amounted to unusual nuclear saber rattling.</p><p>It came days after Russia declared it had tested nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missiles and sea drones.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>That however appeared to be untrue.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- that China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Nuclear-armed bully&#39; -</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.</p><p>&quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the United States do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The Trump directive to resume testing appeared to alarm Iran, whose foreign minister called it &quot;regressive and irresponsible,&quot; and a threat to international security.</p><p>&quot;A nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons. The same bully has been demonizing Iran&#39;s peaceful nuclear program,&quot; Abbas Araghchi posted on social media.</p><p>United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said through his deputy spokesman that &quot;nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.&quot;</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations with Russia and China on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>burs-sms-dk/mlm/sla</p></div></article></div>",

Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.</p><h3>Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?</h3><p>Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.</p><p>The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.</p><p>The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.</p><p>As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.</p><p>► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?</p><p>► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line?

One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.</p><p>Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”</p><p>Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”</p><p>The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.</p><p>The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.</p><p>Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue.

After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”</p><p>Republicans face their own risks.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness.

Two Mississippi sheriffs, Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams, were among those arrested.</p><p>Some bribes were as large as $20,000 and $37,000, authorities said at a news conference.</p><p>“It’s just a monumental betrayal of public trust,” US Attorney Clay Joyner said.</p><p>The indictments say law enforcement officers provided armed escort services on multiple occasions to an FBI agent posing as a member of a Mexican drug cartel. The indictments allege the officers understood they were helping to transport 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of cocaine through Mississippi Delta counties and into Memphis. Some of the officers also provided escort services to protect the transportation of drug proceeds.</p><p>Gaston and Williams are alleged to have received bribes in exchange for giving the operations their “blessing,” one indictment said. It also alleged that Gaston attempted to disguise the payments as campaign contributions, but did not report them as required by law.</p><p>Federal officials said the investigation into the alleged crimes began when people who had been arrested complained about having to pay bribes to various individuals.</p><p>“Law enforcement is only effective when the community they protect can trust the law enforcement officers are honestly serving the community’s interests,” Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jackson Field Office, said. “This type of corruption strikes at the heart of the community.”</p><p>Nineteen of the 20 people indicted are also charged with violating federal gun laws.</p><p>Court records show that the federal defender’s office is representing 16 of the 20 people charged, including the two sheriffs. That office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Thursday evening seeking comment on the charges.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.</p><p>“The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”</p><p>Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.</p><p>In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marshand-crisler-sheriff-mississippi-bribery-convicted-488d0ab9a92a57a3d3327eb0d04e9003\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:convicted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">convicted</a> of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon.

reduced to piles of rubble that litter the now-muddy ground.</p><p>“We have nowhere to stay,” Britney Samms, a resident of Black River’s Vineyard District, told CNN.</p><p>Black River was one of the worst-hit places in all of Jamaica. A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.</p><p>Hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.</p><p>Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.</p><p>“We live in a board house. Everything is gone – dressers, stove – everything is gone,” Samms said, sitting beside other residents next to shopping carts loaded with their remaining belongings.</p><p>It was “a nice, quiet, very docile town,” said a man from a nearby town after surveying the devastation. Now it’s a “hell on Earth,” he said.</p><p>The town’s narrow roads are now cluttered with metal roof panels, slabs of concrete, and all kinds of trash that the water brought in.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vTfADd9.ad6Jja0obRALxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/68b63a11c90bca18d8534598f2a0ddaa><noscript><img alt=\"Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vTfADd9.ad6Jja0obRALxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/68b63a11c90bca18d8534598f2a0ddaa class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Agonizing screams often echo through the town as residents walk around in circles, searching for loved ones or taking stock of the damage.</p><p>The heat and humidity are adding another layer of complexity to the recovery efforts.
