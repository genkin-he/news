The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.</p><p>Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment.</p><h3>Injuries were devastating</h3><p>The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.</p><p>A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.</p><p>Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.</p><p>In another emotional courtroom moment in December 2023, Zwerner read a statement during the sentencing of the student’s mother on charges related to the shooting.</p><p>“The boy pointed the gun directly at me and shot. The single bullet went through my left hand and lodged into my upper left chest, leaving traces of bullet fragments in both areas that will remain forever,” Zwerner said at the time.</p><p>“When this happened and emergency responders worked to keep me alive, I was not sure whether it would be my final moment on earth.”</p><h3>School official is only defendant</h3><p>Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit filed months after the shooting. A judge previously dismissed the other original defendants, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>The student’s mother was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/virgina-teacher-mother-shooting-sentenced?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentenced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentenced</a> to a total of nearly four years in prison for  child neglect and federal weapons charges.</p><p>The boy was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-no-charges?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not charged</a> with any wrongdoing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758><noscript><img alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/22/us/newport-news-virginia-teacher-shooting-gun-closet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously told CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previously told CNN</a>.</p><p>However, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/virginia-teacher-shooting-mother-guilty?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:later said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">later said</a> authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock.

They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.</p><p>A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.</p><p>And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/snap-benefits-food-stamps-explainer?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</a></p><p>The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare.

But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.</p><p>Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their mortgages and other obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.</p><h3>Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?</h3><p>Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.</p><p>The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.</p><p>The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.</p><p>As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.</p><p>► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?</p><p>► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?</p><p>► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.2ZjBKz.kyX_AIB1KrY79Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3a8c1e9a5fcb1449dbb7fe0d998d6f8a><noscript><img alt=\"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.2ZjBKz.kyX_AIB1KrY79Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3a8c1e9a5fcb1449dbb7fe0d998d6f8a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><h3>A hint of hope as senators talk</h3><p>A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators</a>. One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.</p><p>Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”</p><p>Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”</p><p>The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.</p><p>The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.</p><p>Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.</p><p>But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/democrats-afge-union-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:American Federation of Government Employees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">American Federation of Government Employees</a> union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cBHJE6Mm.lZU_cV8DlDGng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f272ef5a447ba10747dd6337e9cb8254><noscript><img alt=\"House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cBHJE6Mm.lZU_cV8DlDGng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f272ef5a447ba10747dd6337e9cb8254 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”</p><p>Republicans face their own risks.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-mike-johnson-shutdown-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Georgia Rep.

about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.</p><p>He’s just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!</p><p>“Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/10/no-trump-isnt-destroying-the-white-house/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:National Review wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">National Review wrote</a>.</p><p>The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/25/ballroom-east-wing-trump-white-house/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere</a>.”</p><p>Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.</p><p>In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those who dislike Trump that are objecting.</p><p>New <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/939641649/Yahoo-YouGov-Ballroom-Poll-October-2025\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Yahoo News-YouGov;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Yahoo News-YouGov</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/trump-east-wing-demolition-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Post-ABC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Washington Post-ABC News</a> polls are the first quality surveys to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. And both show similar things.</p><p>The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.</p><p>The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.</p><p>Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.</p><p>For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.</p><p>Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.</p><p>In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>So this <em>does</em> appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.</p><p>None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.</p><p>An important question from there is why people disapprove.</p><p>Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:won’t interfere with the current building;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">won’t interfere with the current building</a>,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)</p><p>All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.</p><p>While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).</p><p>That’s a little counter intuitive.</p><p>The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.</p><p>What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.</p><p>Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/oval-office-gold-decor-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:gilded the interior of the White House;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gilded the interior of the White House</a>. He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/video/trump-gold-crown-south-korea-gift-digvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:like a golden crown from South Korea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">like a golden crown from South Korea</a>.</p><p>There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this.

In the past two months, its regulators have asked the U.S. chipmaker to explain whether the H20 chip posed backdoor security risks and cautioned domestic firms over purchases.</p><p>At a Citadel Securities event this month, Huang bemoaned that the tit-for-tat actions had slashed Nvidia&#39;s market share for advanced AI chips in China from 95% in 2022 to virtually zero.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also speaking aboard Air Force One, said that after Trump&#39;s meeting with Xi, Nvidia would talk to China and see what was possible.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s so many chips we already sent to China, a lot of advanced chips.&quot;</p><p>But two people familiar with discussions in the Chinese market said they were skeptical that Beijing would quickly change its stance on Nvidia chips, adding that China did not want to settle for inferior chips since the H20 was far behind the Blackwell in performance and it believed that domestic rivals could catch up with the H20 soon.</p><p>One said they would still be willing to consider the downgraded version of the Blackwell chip, dubbed the B30A, if Washington approved its sales to China.</p><p>The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the situation is a sensitive one.</p><p>(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Eduardo Baptista; Additional reporting by Fanny Potkin, Che Pan, Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin.

comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.</p><p>Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%.
