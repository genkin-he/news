of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement came in the wake of Russia saying it had tested a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable torpedo, as well as a new cruise missile.</p><p>But Trump sparked confusion as well as concern, with no clarity on whether he was ordering testing of US nuclear-capable systems or actual test blasts -- something the country has not done for three decades.</p><p>Iran, which has been in conflict with the United States for years over its controversial nuclear projects, called the directive &quot;regressive and irresponsible.&quot;</p><p>&quot;A

Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.</p><p>Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.</p><p>The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.</p><p>Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.</p><p>“I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”</p><p>When asked by reporters in Malaysia on Friday about Trump’s post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon would move quickly and work with the Department of Energy. He argued that “resuming testing is a pretty responsible” way to keep a “credible nuclear deterrent.”</p><p>Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.</p><p>A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”</p><p>He seemed less cautious in his <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Truth Social message;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Truth Social message</a> this week.</p><p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”</p><p>Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.</p><p>“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.</p><p>He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.</p><p>Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.</p><p>Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.</p><p>“Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.</p><p>Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.</p><p>“I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.</p><p>“I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”</p><p>If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.</p><p>“The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.</p><p>Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.</p><p>In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.</p><p>In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”</p><p>“I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.</p><p>He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.</p><p>Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.</p><p>“If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.</p><p>“The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.</p><p>“But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional information.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

No matter what your stance on immigration might be, I think it’s pretty fair to say that randomly snatching people who are going about their everyday lives sounds like the building plot of a dystopian horror film.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wednesday morning, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) had to make a heartbreaking plea </span><a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/29/gov-pritzker-letter-kristi-noem-ice-enforcement-pause-chicago-halloween\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:via a letter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>via a letter</span></a><span> to the Department of Homeland Security: to pause immigration raids in Chicago for Halloween weekend long enough to allow children to celebrate the holiday without fear.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The letter was sent to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd M. Lyons, and Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Rodney S. Scott, per </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/let-children-be-children-pritzker-asks-feds-to-pause-chicago-area-immigration-operations-for-halloween/3845344/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:NBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>NBC</span></a><span>.

And as for the purported criminals they’re arresting to justify this trauma? Sixty-five percent of the people arrested by ICE so far this year have no criminal records, per the </span><a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/65-people-taken-ice-had-no-convictions-93-no-violent-convictions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cato Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Cato Institute</span></a><span>, and more than 93% have never been convicted of a violent offense.&nbsp;</span></p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p><span>Even the language the government is using to justify the Chicago raids, which is being dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” sounds straight out of a World War II history textbook. All of this is by design, a part of the larger Trump narrative that the U.S. is being invaded from within.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If the Trump administration has little regard for people’s lives, not caring about the well-being of children is a whole new level of demonic aura. But as disheartening as the scenes of ICE raids in Chicago have been, we’ve also seen evidence of people standing together and fighting back, including clips of dozens of people filming officers as they arrest civilians to make sure this abysmal time in history is recorded for all to see.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Frankly, we can’t believe we’re in the “children deserve to celebrate a holiday without fearing for their lives” part of the second Trump term, yet here we are. </span></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/children-halloween-without-ice-chicago_n_6904afdee4b00c26f0713910?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

as the United States.</p><p>&quot;My understanding is that the agreement, which was found between the US and China in this matter, is &#39;erga omnes&#39;, so we should apply it to all and, of course, including the European Union,&quot; Maros Sefcovic told reporters during a visit to Rome.</p><p>Following discussions with the United States, China on Thursday said it would suspend certain export restrictions announced in October, including on rare earth materials, for one year.</p><p>The controls on rare earths -- a major sticking point in trade negotiations between US President Donald Trump and China&#39;s President Xi Jinping this week -- have rattled markets and snarled supply chains.</p><p>Sefcovic, who met both with Italy&#39;s Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, said the EU was now having &quot;high-level official talks on export controls&quot; with China.</p><p>&quot;I will speak again with my Chinese counterpart very, very soon,&quot; he added.</p><p>- EU bloc bidding -</p><p>China is the world&#39;s leading producer of the minerals used to make magnets that are crucial to the auto, electronics and defence industries.</p><p>Separate to the October restrictions, it has since April required licences for certain exports, a system Sefcovic said was not working.</p><p>&quot;We have not very positive experience with the issuing of export licenses for the rare earths,&quot; he said.</p><p>Only 50 percent of EU applications had been &quot;properly processed&quot; so companies received the needed rare earth materials, he noted.</p><p>&quot;It has direct implications on the production capacities of the companies in the EU.&quot;</p><p>After meeting Tajani at the foreign ministry, Sefcovic told reporters he envisioned a &quot;common purchase of critical raw materials&quot; by the EU.</p><p>&quot;We can do the bidding on behalf of the biggest trading bloc in the world, which is the European Union, and to get the critical raw materials for a better price,&quot; he said</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The stockpiles would be &quot;stored in Europe so we will not be under this permanent tension&quot;.</p><p>Tajani proposed that Italy could host such a storage site.</p><p>- &#39;Dumping&#39; dispute -</p><p>Sefcovic also said the EU was backing Italy, which is facing punitive tariffs on exports of pasta to the United States, by showing its US counterparts that their &quot;surprising&quot; accusation of dumping was unfounded.</p><p>Last month, the US Department of Commerce said it would impose provisional anti-dumping duties of over 91 percent on Italian pasta makers from January. This would be applied on top of the 15-percent tariff imposed on all EU imports.</p><p>&quot;This was a very surprising move from the United States towards the European Union, towards pasta producers,&quot; Sefcovic said.</p><p>He said he believed the commerce department &quot;didn&#39;t have proper or enough detailed information from some producers of pasta in Italy&quot; so the EU, along with Italy and its pasta producers, was working to provide it.</p><p>ams/ar/jj</p></div></article></div>",
