interpreting the announcement as US preparations for a shock resumption of explosive testing after more than 30 years.</p><p>The US president baffled foreign government and nuclear weapons experts alike when he said he had ordered the Pentagon to start nuclear weapons testing &quot;on an equal basis&quot; to China and Russia.</p><p>Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the US president also said that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests and it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again because others are testing.</p><p>The last time Russia officially tested a nuclear weapon was in 1990, and the United States last tested a nuclear bomb in 1992.</p><p>North Korea is the only country to have conducted nuclear weapons tests this century.</p><p>Heloise Fayet, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations, said it was not immediately clear what Trump meant -- &nbsp;or whether the United States might be preparing to tear up the global rulebook and resume nuclear weapons testing after a 33-year hiatus.</p><p>&quot;Either he is talking about testing missiles, but the United States already does that,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Or he is talking about subcritical tests, but I don&#39;t think he has mastered that level of technology,&quot; she added, referring to low-yield tests authorised by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p><p>&quot;Or he is talking about real tests, but no one does that except North Korea.&quot;</p><p>Trump&#39;s announcement came after President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had in recent days tested nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons -- the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater drone.</p><p>On Thursday, the Kremlin sought to cool tensions, saying those tests did not constitute a test of an atomic weapon.</p><p>- &#39;Extremely complicated&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>William Alberque, a former head of NATO&#39;s nuclear non-proliferation centre, pointed to Trump&#39;s lack of clarity.</p><p>&quot;Initially, I thought Trump was reacting to Russia&#39;s announcements about new systems like the nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik and the Poseidon torpedo. So my first interpretation was that Trump was referring to system testing, not warhead testing,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>But like all nuclear powers, the United States already tests its weapons.</p><p>In September, the United States carried out tests of its nuclear-capable Trident missiles.</p><p>There is also a possibility that Trump might have meant the so-called subcritical nuclear tests, said Fayet.</p><p>&quot;We are almost certain that Russia and China are conducting subcritical tests that release a certain amount of energy but remain within the limits,&quot; said Fayet.</p><p>But &quot;in the United States, they are conducting more restrictive subcritical tests, with no energy release, no heat and no critical reaction&quot;.</p><p>Trump could demand to catch up, she said.</p><p>&quot;But it&#39;s an extremely complicated subject, and I don&#39;t know if he is at that level of subtlety,&quot; she added.</p><p>- &#39;Chain reaction&#39; -</p><p>Alberque said that after closely examining Trump&#39;s statements, he was inclined to think that &quot;he&#39;s talking about warhead testing.&quot;</p><p>Many Trump supporters have long lobbied for a resumption of nuclear testing, despite the existence of computer-based simulations as well as serious negative international consequences.</p><p>&quot;America must prepare to test nuclear weapons,&quot; the influential conservative think tank Heritage Foundation said in a report in January, referring to a &quot;deteriorating security environment&quot;.</p><p>Some experts said Trump&#39;s latest pronouncements were a gift to the governments of Russia and China.</p><p>In 2023, Putin ordered the Russian defence ministry and the nuclear agency Rosatom to &quot;ensure readiness for testing Russian nuclear weapons&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We know for certain that some figures in Washington are already considering the possibility of conducting live tests of their nuclear weapons,&quot; Putin said during his address to the Federal Assembly in February, 2023.</p><p>&quot;But if the US conducts tests, then we will too.&quot;</p><p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said on X that Trump&#39;s policy was &quot;incoherent: calling for denuclearisation talks one day; threatening nuclear tests the next&quot;.</p><p>The resumption of such tests &quot;could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by US adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,&quot; Kimball said.</p><p>fz-as/ah/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and will be taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>If confirmed, that would leave the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional development. </em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

citing &quot;increasing pressure and risks&quot;.</p><p>The All About Macau Media (AAMacau) news platform, co-founded by late journalist Ng Sio Ngai more than a decade ago, has often been critical of social issues in the Chinese city.</p><p>AAMacau, whose Chinese-language name means &quot;discuss as much as possible&quot;, runs digital and print platforms and also has a social media presence.</p><p>The outlet said this month&#39;s print edition would be its last, with the rest of its operation to end in December.</p><p>It said it had been told by Macau officials that it &quot;no longer meets the statutory requirements to engage in relevant activities&quot; under the Chinese special administrative region&#39;s media law and that its monthly publication registration number has been revoked.</p><p>&quot;Facing resource constraints, mounting external pressures, and the need for our reporters to navigate judicial proceedings, the team found it increasingly difficult to maintain reporting standards,&quot; AAMacau said.</p><p>It said it &quot;had no choice but to make this difficult decision&quot;.</p><p>In April, two AAMacau reporters were detained by police while covering an event in the city&#39;s legislature, which it said was the first case of its kind in Macau.</p><p>It said on Thursday that three of its journalists could face criminal charges over the incident.</p><p>The city&#39;s Government Information Bureau has not yet responded to an AFP request for comment.</p><p>- &#39;Swift deterioration&#39; -</p><p>Macau, which has its own legal system largely based on Portuguese law, enacted national security legislation in 2009 and widened its powers in 2023.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists said the closure of AAMacau is &quot;a blow to press freedom and a highly troubling development&quot;.</p><p>It &quot;marks a swift deterioration&quot; in Macau&#39;s media environment, the advocacy group told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

in a local newspaper in 2010, AAMacau established its website about two years later, followed by the first monthly magazine printed in May 2013.</p><p>In recent years, the outlet has transitioned into a subscription and donation-based funding model.</p><p>AAMacau said its decision came about a year after it started facing restrictions in accessing government events.</p><p>Political scientist and veteran journalist Eric Sautede called the outlet&#39;s closure an &quot;absolute loss&quot;.</p><p>He said AAMacau had &quot;helped foster a measure of accountability among those in power -- both in government and in the private sector&quot;.</p><p>twa/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

runs military drills involving systems that are capable of carrying such weapons (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>President Donald Trump landed back in the United States Thursday after a surprise directive to begin nuclear weapons testing that raised the specter of renewed superpower tensions.</p><p>The announcement on social media was issued right as Trump was going into a summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.</p><p>And it came days after Russia declared it had tested a nuclear-capable cruise missile and a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable sea drone.</p><p>The blunt statement from Trump, who boasts frequently about being a &quot;peace&quot; president, left much unanswered.</p><p>Chiefly, it was unclear whether he meant testing weapons systems or actually conducting test explosions -- something the United States has not done since 1992.</p><p>Regardless, the statement amounted to unusual nuclear sabre rattling.</p><p>&quot;Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Trump also claimed that the United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country and that he had achieved this in his first term as president.</p><p>None of that appeared to be true.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says in its latest annual report that Russia possesses 5,489 nuclear warheads, compared to 5,177 for the United States and 600 for China.</p><p>In his post, Trump said -- minutes ahead of his Xi summit -- said China was expected to &quot;be even within 5 years.&quot;</p><p>- Russia pushes back -</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun urged the United States to &quot;earnestly abide&quot; by a global nuclear testing ban.</p><p>The Kremlin questioned whether Trump was well-informed about Russia&#39;s military activities.</p><p>The recent weapons drills &quot;cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test,&quot; spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. &quot;We hope that the information was conveyed correctly to President Trump.&quot;</p><p>Peskov then implied that Russia would conduct its own live warhead tests if Trump did it first.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;If someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,&quot; Peskov said.</p><p>Both countries observe a de facto moratorium on testing nuclear warheads, though Russia and the US do regularly run military drills involving nuclear-capable systems.</p><p>The United States has been a signatory since 1996 to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions, whether for military or civilian purposes.</p><p>Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that it had been &quot;many years&quot; since the United States had conducted nuclear tests, but it was &quot;appropriate&quot; to start again.</p><p>Further muddying the waters, Trump also repeated in his remarks to reporters a previous claim that he wants negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons forces.</p><p>&quot;Denuclearization would be a tremendous thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s something we are actually talking to Russia about, and China would be added to that if we do something.&quot;</p><p>- Last US test in 1992 -</p><p>The United States conducted 1,054 nuclear tests between July 16, 1945, when the first test was conducted in New Mexico, and 1992, as well as two nuclear attacks on Japan during World War II.</p><p>It is the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat.</p><p>The last US nuclear test explosion was in September 1992, with a 20-kiloton underground detonation at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.</p><p>Then-president George H.W. Bush imposed&nbsp;a moratorium on further tests in October 1992 that has been continued by successive administrations.</p><p>Nuclear testing was replaced by&nbsp;non-nuclear and subcritical experiments using advanced computer simulations.</p><p>Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus responded that she would introduce legislation to &quot;put a stop&quot; to any move at restoring live weapons testing in her state.</p><p>And Senator Jacky Rosen, also a Democrat, said on X that Trump&#39;s statement &quot;directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees... who&#39;ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen &amp; is unnecessary.&quot;</p><p>burs-sms/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.</p><p>Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.</p><p>Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide#toc-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to</a> the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>“There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.</p><p>“Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.</p><p>“All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.</p><p>China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.</p><p>China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/politics/china-suspected-silo-fields-report?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to the Federation of American Scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">according to the Federation of American Scientists</a>, and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/china/china-military-parade-analysis-intl-hnk-ml-dst?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a military parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a military parade</a> in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.</p><p>When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”</p><p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”</p><p>The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.</p><h3>A new arms race?</h3><p>Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.</p><p>The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.</p><p>But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.</p><p>“If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.</p><p>Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.</p><p>When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.</p><p>“I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”</p><p>A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”</p><p>The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.</p><p>North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.</p><p>After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/asia/nuclear-testing-china-russia-us-exclusive-intl-hnk-ml?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN reported in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN reported in 2023</a> that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>“There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p><em>CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
