Both would add pressure to ‌Kremlin budget revenues, one trader ⁠said.</p><p>Market participants anticipate discounts for Urals in China could widen by $2–$5 per barrel from the current $10-$12 on a delivered-to-port basis, with some ⁠expecting deeper cuts in the months ahead.</p><p>&quot;There haven&#39;t been any fresh Urals deals in China yet, but traders are preparing for negotiations to start at around minus $15 per barrel ​on a ​DES (delivered ex ship) basis,&quot; a trading source ​told Reuters.</p><p>Russian oil imports to China ‌could rise for a third consecutive month in February, potentially reaching a record 2.1 million barrels per day as independent refiners take advantage of discounted cargoes following India&#39;s reduced buying.</p><p>Even so, some market participants warn that Chinese demand for Russian oil may be nearing its peak.</p><p>&quot;April could be a critical month for shipments.

from 7 to 9 per cent across two stages in 2023 and 2024 - was done to fund permanent and growing healthcare spending needs of an ageing population, added PM Wong, addressing concerns raised by MPs over three days of debate on the Budget 2026 statement that he had delivered on Feb 12.</p><p>He was responding to a call by Workers’ Party MP Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) to re-evaluate the GST hike, given <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2026-govt-expects-to-end-fy2025-with-a-surplus-of-15-1b-more-than-double-estimated\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a larger-than-expected $15.1 billion Budget surplus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a larger-than-expected $15.1 billion Budget surplus</a> for the 2025 financial year that was in part due to stronger corporate tax collections.</p><p>When the decision was made in 2022 on when to increase the GST rate, there was no sign that corporate income tax collections would rise significantly, and discussions on global tax reform were still evolving, said PM Wong.</p><p>The eventual outcomes and their revenue implications were far from certain, he said. “It would not have been responsible to fund permanent healthcare commitments using revenue sources that were uncertain and can yet dry up.”</p><p>He laid out the medium-term outlook for revenue and expenditure as he tackled criticism from opposition MPs on his Government’s fiscal marksmanship. During the debate, several WP MPs had questioned whether the Government was overly conservative in its fiscal projections and wound up running a surplus that was too large.</p><p>On revenue, PM Wong said the authorities expect a structural increase to kick in from the 2027 financial year, when the first tranche of additional collections roll in from the domestic top-up tax that Singapore is implementing under a global tax reform framework - BEPS. It will raise the effective tax rate for large multinational enterprises to 15 per cent and could be a “significant” increase in revenue.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The recent rise in corporate tax collections - which are dependent on how the economy performs - in the last two years was not an outcome that was anticipated, said PM Wong. He added that the Government would continue to firm up its estimates for the collections in the coming months with updated data on how firms are performing and adjusting their plans.</p><p>On expenditure, the Government has been spending more in many other areas beyond healthcare, such as social needs, economic competitiveness, Singapore’s energy transition, as well as security and infrastructure.</p><p>Expenditure pressures are already evident, said PM Wong, citing defence spending as an example.</p><p>He had said during his Budget statement that the Defence Ministry’s budget would remain at about 3 per cent of GDP - the largest across the ministries - which would include expenditure on cybersecurity by the ministry and the Singapore Armed Forces.</p><p>But the Government will also have to invest more in cybersecurity in other agencies, which contributes to more security spending in the coming years, he said in his wrap-up speech.</p><p>With this outlook in mind, the Ministry of Finance will be publishing by 2027 the updated medium-term projected figures for revenue and expenditure up till 2035, said PM Wong.</p><p>The last time it published such projections was in 2023, when it said in an occasional paper that state expenditure would increase from about 18 per cent of GDP then to 20 per cent by 2030.</p><p>He cautioned that assumptions can quickly become outdated, so the forward projections serve as a guide and will have to be continually updated.</p><p>“Ultimately, what matters most is maintaining fiscal discipline together with the agility and nimbleness to respond swiftly as circumstances change.”</p><p>Overall, the Government aims to have a balanced budget over its term and does not aim to run high surpluses over the next few years, said PM Wong. Balanced means a fiscal surplus within the range of 0.5 per cent of GDP. The 2025 financial year surplus was 1.9 per cent of GDP.</p><p>The larger-than-expected surplus of $15.1 billion&nbsp;drew the most scrutiny over the three days of the Budget debate, with MPs on both sides of the aisle suggesting that these funds be channelled towards Singaporeans.</p><p>&quot;When there are revenue upsides, we will deploy these to meet our growing needs,” said PM Wong.</p><p>Some have already been shared with Singaporeans, noted PM Wong, referencing a proposal from Mr Shawn Loh (Jalan Besar GRC) on the first day of the debate for any fiscal surpluses above 2 per cent of GDP to be given back to Singaporeans through measures like extra CDC vouchers and universal CPF top-ups.</p><p>“In practice, we actually do not wait to cross a mechanical threshold like that,” he said, citing the SG60 package in 2025, and the CPF top-ups and the Cost-of-Living Special Payment in Budget 2026.</p><p>In light of the fiscal position, Mr Loh had also suggested during the debate that the Government commit to no further major revenue-raising moves till 2035, beyond its promise not to raise the GST until 2030.</p><p>PM Wong said that if circumstances remain broadly stable and without any further major revenue moves, Singapore’s fiscal position during this term of government is expected to remain healthy.</p><p>The Government will continue to review its tax system and make revenue adjustments only when necessary – to fund structural spending needs or achieve clear policy objectives such as strengthening progressivity or addressing externalities, said PM Wong.</p><p>“Any tax increase is a difficult decision. We take them only after careful study and full consideration of the impact on households and businesses.”</p><p>PM Wong also pledged to provide more information to ensure fiscal accountability and value for money in government spending, following calls for such accountability by WP chief Pritam Singh (Aljunied GRC), Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), and Nominated MP Haresh Singaraju over the course of the Budget debate.</p><p>He said he would ask all ministries to provide clearer and more accessible information on major initiatives so that Singaporeans can better understand how public resources are used and what results they achieve.</p><p>In a follow-up question after his speech, WP chair Sylvia Lim said PM Wong had been more cautious about upsides from the potential&nbsp;first BEPS top-up tax collections in previous debates, and had said to consider the incentives that would have to be given out. She asked if his view had changed.</p><p>“Governments everywhere want to attract these strategic investments to their own countries, and they are continuing notwithstanding a minimum corporate tax of 15 per cent to offer other generous incentives, which are considered BEPS-compliant,” he said.</p><p>Amid a competitive global landscape, where other governments are spending more, and offering different incentives, he noted: “The revenue upside is more assured in terms of the domestic top-up tax, but at the same time, we are very likely to also have to spend more on the economic front to stay competitive.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/extra-corporate-tax-collections-do-not-replace-stable-reliable-revenue-base-from-gst-says-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

signalled it was in no hurry to sign a deal.</p><p>US leader Donald Trump is pushing for an end to Europe&#39;s deadliest conflict since World War II, but has so far failed to broker any deal between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p>Previous rounds of US-led negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Geneva and Abu Dhabi have failed to yield a compromise, including on the key sticking point of territory.</p><p>Russia, which has signalled it will not budge on its demands for full control of Ukraine&#39;s eastern Donetsk region, said Thursday it was too early to make forecasts about when a deal would take place.</p><p>&quot;Have you heard anything from us about deadlines? We have no deadlines, we have tasks. We are getting them done,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state media.</p><p>Kyiv says the only way of breaking the deadlock is a leaders&#39; meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, and that it aims to lay the ground for such a summit during talks on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;Today in Geneva we continue our work within the framework of the negotiation process. A bilateral meeting with the American delegation has begun -- with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner,&quot; Ukraine&#39;s lead negotiator Rustem Umerov said.</p><p>Ukraine aims to &quot;synchronize positions&quot; with the United States ahead of fresh trilateral talks in March, he added.</p><p>Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev plans to be in Geneva on Thursday, though there is no indication he plans to meet the Ukrainian side, according to Russian state media.</p><p>&quot;Dmitriev plans to arrive in Geneva on Thursday to pursue negotiations with the Americans on economic issues,&quot; Russia&#39;s TASS news agency cited an unnamed source as saying.</p><p>- Drone and missile attacks -</p><p>Hours before the meeting, Russian forces launched some 420 drones and 39 missiles at Ukraine, wounding more than two dozen people in at least six different regions, according to authorities.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>AFP journalists heard several explosions in central Kyiv shortly after authorities warned Russia had launched its attack.</p><p>The strikes hit an electricity substation in the southern Odesa region, as well as a school building in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, according to officials.</p><p>&quot;Destruction has been recorded in eight regions, with many private homes and apartment buildings damaged,&quot; Zelensky said.</p><p>Also ahead of the meeting, Russia announced that it had returned the bodies of 1,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers to Ukraine, while Moscow received 35 Russian bodies in exchange.</p><p>The two sides regularly exchange the remains of killed serviceman, one of the few areas of cooperation between the warring countries.</p><p>Zelensky spoke with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday ahead of the talks, with US envoys Witkoff and Kushner part of the 30-minute call.</p><p>&quot;We expect this meeting (in Geneva) to create an opportunity to move talks to the leaders&#39; level. President Trump supports this sequence of steps,&quot; Zelensky said.</p><p>After first refusing to negotiate with Russia, Zelensky has repeatedly said that the only way of resolving difficult issues, including territory, is through a meeting with Putin.</p><p>Talks between Moscow and Kyiv remain deadlocked over the fate of the Donbas -- the industrial region in eastern Ukraine that has been the epicentre of the fighting.</p><p>Russia is pushing for full control of Ukraine&#39;s eastern Donetsk region, and has threatened to take it by force if Kyiv does not cave at the negotiating table.</p><p>But Ukraine has rejected the demand and signalled it would not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again.</p><p>bur-cad/jbr/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

The activities include exploiting electronic warfare and deception tactics in real time, they said.</p><p>And while the masking is unlikely to fully deceive air traffic controllers or military-grade radars, it could sow time-wasting confusion in a conflict, conceal sensitive surveillance activity or be used for propaganda or misinformation, the envoys and intelligence analysts said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;We&#39;ve not seen anything like this before,&quot; said Ben Lewis, founder of the open-source data platform PLATracker.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s ... a kind of deception trial being carried out in real time using aircraft that are not exactly low profile. It does not appear to be at all accidental.&quot;</p><p>China&#39;s defence ministry didn&#39;t respond to Reuters questions about the flights and their purpose.</p><p>BELARUSIAN CARGO PLANE</p><p>The flights have mostly appeared on Flightradar24 as an Ilyushin-62 cargo plane operated by Rada Airlines of Belarus but also a Royal Air Force ‌Typhoon, a North Korean Il-62 passenger jet and an anonymous Gulfstream executive jet.</p><p>Since mid-December, YILO4200 has also made ⁠several flights in northwest China, most recently on February 15 when it appeared as an anonymous Pilatus PC-12, a small turboprop passenger aircraft.</p><p>Aircraft registration numbers stem from a coded so-called 24-bit address governed by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Broadcast via transponders, the numbers help reveal an aircraft&#39;s position, direction and speed.</p><p>While unique to each aircraft, the addresses are publicly known and two pilots and two analysts say recoding a transponder to give it a different registration number is possible.</p><p>Rada was ⁠sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control in August 2024 for flying cargoes in and out of Africa that included Wagner Group personnel linked to the Russian military, as well as exotic wildlife trafficking.</p><p>The real Belarusian Il-62 has been active throughout the period with a different call sign and was once airborne at the same time as the Chinese drone attempting to mask it, the Flightradar24 data showed.</p><p>Rada Airlines did not respond to a request for comment and Britain&#39;s defence ministry said it could not comment.</p><p>An ICAO spokesperson said the body does not comment on issues or speculation concerning specific member states.</p><p>OPERATION COULD SOW CONFUSION</p><p>Flying out of Hainan&#39;s Qionghai Boao International Airport, the aircraft frequently ​remained ​airborne for hours, flying star- or hourglass-shaped patterns over the same areas.</p><p>The flight profiles matched those typically associated with large military drones on surveillance operations and covered sensitive parts of ​the South China Sea, including areas frequented by submarines, four intelligence analysts familiar with the data said.</p><p>The Chinese military ‌generally flies its drones &quot;dark&quot;, transmitting neither call signs nor registration numbers.</p><p>Two flights among the 23 reviewed by Reuters appeared to be particularly unusual: In one, that straddled August 5 and 6, the drone initially transmitted a code belonging to the RAF Typhoon, then switched signal to three other planes over about 20 minutes, eventually landing as the Rada Airlines plane.</p><p>In another, on November 18, the drone was airborne purporting to be the Belarusian plane when the actual Rada Il-62 plane took off near Belarus headed for Tehran.</p><p>Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill said the Hainan operations appeared to be a fresh tactic in a suite of Chinese digital options to &quot;muddy the waters&quot; should regional tensions escalate into conflict.</p><p>&quot;They don&#39;t appear to be exercises as much as the kind of action the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has described as rehearsals for a confrontation - anything the Chinese can do to sow confusion in the minds of their rivals is to their advantage,&quot; said Neill, a fellow at Hawaii&#39;s Pacific Forum.</p><p>&quot;The U.S. and its allies know that given the realities of highly automated conventional conflict, even milliseconds count along the kill chain of escalation.&quot;</p><p>The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on the Chinese drone flights.</p><p>Lewis and three other open-source intelligence analysts said the YILO4200 call ‌sign came from long-endurance Wing Loong 2 unmanned aerial vehicle, an aircraft similar to the U.S. Reaper drone, with a wingspan of 20.5 metres (67 feet).</p><p>The Wing Loong is used ​mainly for surveillance but can be fitted for other tasks, including command and control operations, precision missile strikes and anti-submarine operations.</p><p>It is produced by the state-linked Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, a subsidiary ​of AVIC. The company said it would not be commenting on the issue.</p><p>Online flight tracker Amelia Smith first connected the Wing Loong 2 to ​the call sign by analysing flight data, state press reports and government announcements.</p><p>Lewis, Smith and two other intelligence analysts said it was unclear which Chinese agency was operating the aircraft out of Boao Airport, which is a dual-use commercial and military ‌facility.</p><p>Satellite images from July, September and January obtained by Reuters show large drones on the tarmac, alongside support buildings ​in a part of the airport now being expanded.</p><p>REHEARSAL FOR TAIWAN</p><p>Flightradar24 communications director Ian ​Petchenik said the tracker had noticed the Hainan flights and had not seen such activity before, beyond apparently accidental miscodings, non-existent addresses or corrupted data.</p><p>&quot;Based on the flight patterns and the kind of usage of these 24-bit addresses, it doesn&#39;t seem like it is a mistake in the programming of the transponders,&quot; Petchenik said.</p><p>Reuters couldn&#39;t determine whether the flights are running on programmed paths or being controlled from the ground.</p><p>The paths run through areas of heavy naval activity, including the waters south of Hainan near Chinese submarine bases and east toward the Bashi Channel between ​Taiwan and the Philippines - a key choke point for China&#39;s navy to access the Pacific.</p><p>The route patterns suggest a ‌rehearsal for an operation over Taiwan, said Neill, the security analyst.</p><p>Overlaid on a map of Taiwan, the 23 flight paths pass multiple military points of interest, concentrated around Taipei but also extending along the island&#39;s southern coastline. The eastern trajectories bring the aircraft ​close to Japanese and U.S. bases in Okinawa and other islands in the Ryukyu chain.</p><p>&quot;It is a compelling image - extensive rehearsals across the South China Sea to be deployed over Taiwan&#39;s key points,&quot; Neill said.</p><p>(Reporting By Greg Torode in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by ​Karen Lema in Manila, Idrees Ali in Washington, Gleb Stolyarov in Moscow, Sam Tabahriti in London and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Joe Brock and Lincoln Feast.)</p></div></article></div>",

It sounds like it’s absolutely his loss — for both you and your kids. One day he’ll realize it, and it will be too late.”</span></p><p><span>I wipe the gunk from my nose as she turns back to the screen and finally exits the questionnaire.

And I’m sorry it was so hard for me to answer those questions today. I wasn’t prepared for it.”</span></p><p><span>She closes the door with a gentle smile. “Don’t worry about it. It&nbsp; happens to the best of us.”</span></p><p><span>I sat in that sterile room for what felt like an eternity, alongside the heavy identity of being a fatherless daughter. Even at 40, an age where medical history becomes increasingly vital, I was filled with a primal resentment at being forced to acknowledge the void.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Most days, I can focus on the love and affection of the family I </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> have. But sometimes, when I least expect it, something as routine as a medical form can dig a hole in my heart that no prescription can mend. </span><span>Despite the frustration of being forced to confront the pain of estrangement in a clinical setting, I am grateful for the unexpected moment of grace I found with a nurse who understood that for some of us, “medical history” isn’t just data ― it’s a story that we can’t escape.</span></p><p><em>Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

Singapore’s total social spending has increased in Budget 2026 to provide more help for Singaporeans, said Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Feb 26.</p><p>While some have observed social transfers to be smaller than in Budget 2025, support remains substantial and has been broadened in scope, with more given to those with greater needs, he added.</p><p>Even while it helps cushion the cost pressures for households here, PM Wong said the Government’s approach is for steady and sustainable wage growth, which is a more durable solution in the long-term.</p><p>Addressing <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/tackle-inequality-address-cost-of-living-concerns-mps-at-day-1-of-budget-debate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:cost of living concerns that MPs had raised;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">cost of living concerns that MPs had raised</a> across the three days of the Budget debate, PM Wong said data at both the household and individual levels showed that incomes had risen faster than inflation over the past decade across the entire income distribution.</p><p>While spending has risen in dollar terms, Singaporeans are also spending less on essentials such as food, public transport and education across all income quintiles, he added.</p><p>But the lived experience of higher costs does matter, said PM Wong, who noted that while inflation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine has moderated, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/singapore-core-inflation-sees-surprise-drop-to-1-in-january\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:price levels remain high;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">price levels remain high</a>.</p><p>For instance, food consumption forms a smaller share of income, but high prices are experienced each time one dines out. “The psychological impact is immediate and visible,” he acknowledged.</p><p>To cushion the spike in inflation, the Government provided more than $10 billion through the Assurance Package.</p><p>Budget 2026 also saw more help given to seniors, who have to cope with higher prices on fixed incomes, said PM Wong. A retired elderly couple will get about $7,600 in transfers from the Budget, while a lower-income household with young children will get about $5,000.</p><p>This is on top of substantial, broad-based subsidies and targeted support for lower-income families, PM Wong said as he rebutted Mr Louis Chua’s (Sengkang GRC) charge that the Government’s primary response has been to rely on one-off handouts.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“He said that last year, and I had clarified the matter,” said PM Wong. “But regrettably, he has repeated this false claim again.”</p><p>The fact is that only about 5 per cent of the overall budget is for one-off measures, which was also the case in Budget 2025, said the Prime Minister.</p><p>Another driver of costs is manpower, and PM Wong acknowledged that labour costs have indeed risen in recent years.</p><p>This was partly due to structural factors such as an ageing population and tighter labour supply, but also the outcome of policies such as the Progressive Wage Model to raise wages at the bottom.</p><p>PM Wong said that is the right thing to do, as it narrows wage gaps and strengthens dignity in work. But when wages rise, costs also increase, and that is the fundamental tension every economy must manage.</p><p>Some countries suppress service wages to keep prices low, but this traps a segment workers in low-paying jobs, he noted. On the other hand, others such as European countries have high wages, but that leads to higher prices, which in turn has to be supported by a large welfare state.</p><p>Singapore is forging its own path, pursuing broad-based wage growth where wage increases are supported by skills upgrading and productivity improvements.</p><p>At the same time, the Government bears a substantial share of the cost of essential services through subsidies and transfers with more support for lower- and middle-income households, added PM Wong.</p><p>“Overall, this balance has delivered good and affordable services to Singaporeans, at a sustainable cost,” he said.</p><p>PM Wong noted that the one category where household expenditure has gone up as a share of income is healthcare, which reflects Singapore’s ageing population.</p><p>This is why the Government has provided significant and growing subsidies for healthcare services and for national health insurance premiums, while also taking steps to rein in overly generous private riders and other practices that drive up medical inflation, he said.</p><p>“We will continue to ensure that healthcare remains affordable in Singapore,” he said. “No Singaporean will be denied the healthcare they need because of an inability to pay. That is our assurance.”</p><p>Noting that members such as Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) and Nominated MP Terence Ho had suggested additional asset-based transfers, the Prime Minister said this has been the approach the Government has long taken.</p><p>It has done so using mechanisms such as Edusave, CPF and its housing policies to enable Singaporeans to accumulate assets, which gives them a concrete stake in the nation’s success, said PM Wong.</p><p>Singapore also has progressive taxes on wealth, such as on properties and vehicles, and the Government will continue to study ways to moderate excessive wealth concentration.</p><p>But redistribution has its limits, as capital and talent are mobile. Redistribution alone also cannot build a strong and resilient society, said PM Wong.</p><p>“If we rely solely on ever, ever higher taxes, eventually the broad middle will also have to shoulder the burden,” he said.</p><p>Instead, Singapore complements it with heavy investments in human capital: through early childhood education, quality schooling and lifelong learning.</p><p>“Upward mobility remains central to our social compact,” he said. “Because here in Singapore, your starting point should never determine your finishing position.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/wage-growth-not-one-off-handouts-key-to-tackling-cost-pressures-pm-wong?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

They resist stains, oil, grease and water, making them a dream come true for consumers who want to spend less time cleaning or caring for their purchases.</p><p>However, even small amounts of PFAS can be toxic, and larger levels have been linked with an array of negative health effects, including cancer, liver and kidney disease, and birth defects.

Vacuum more.</p><p>“Chemicals in your home products — they don’t stay there. They are shed out.

Your multi-stage carbon filter works pretty well, and reverse-osmosis [filtering] is the most effective.&nbsp;It can be a little bit more expensive compared to the other filter types, but the [reserve-osmosis] filters work really well to reduce PFAS.”</p><p>Of course, the fewer items we own with forever chemicals in them in the first place, the better off we’ll be. So, avoid buying products that claim to be “stain-resistant” or “waterproof,” as these claims are most likely made possible by forever chemicals.</p><p>We also chatted with Stoiber about her take on the risks of using scented candles, the recent controversy over black plastic spatulas in the kitchen, and much more.</p><p><strong>Life: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/funniest-women-social-media-posts-2025-2-14_n_699607dfe4b0f4c9ebbc402d?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Feb. 14-20);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Feb. 14-20)</a></strong></p><p><strong>Listen to the full episode above or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/1707391801\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wherever you get your podcasts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wherever you get your podcasts</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Make sure to subscribe to “Am I Doing It Wrong?” on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pod.link/1707391801\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:whatever podcast platform you prefer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">whatever podcast platform you prefer</a>&nbsp;so you don’t miss a single episode from our brand-new third season.

Decisions made by Singapore’s ministers are carefully recorded, along with their grounds, said Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing.</p><p>This builds up over time into a corpus of knowledge on ministerial discretion, he added, likening it to building up case law.</p><p>He was responding to Workers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), who had asked about the exercise of executive discretion as Parliament debated the budget of the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Ms He wanted to know how ministerial powers, under laws like the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/five-years-of-pofma-how-has-the-law-been-used-to-combat-fake-news\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act</a> and the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, are monitored to ensure they are exercised judiciously.</p><p>She suggested that public bodies should publish periodic reports detailing how their discretionary powers are used, and asked that the legal principles guiding executive discretion be made publicly known.</p><p>This will provide a clear framework for decision-making and reduce public concern about motives, she added.</p><p>In response, Mr Chan said the law intentionally grants discretion to ministers and other officials so that they can exercise their judgment on how best to handle individual cases based on the specific facts, rather than “mechanically applying a rigid rule”.</p><p>The Prime Minister assigns responsibilities, including statutory functions, to ministers, and all of these functions must be exercised strictly in accordance with the law, he said.</p><p>Such powers are subject to parliamentary oversight and safeguards, he added, noting that the rationale behind granting discretionary functions, as well as their scope, limits, and any necessary safeguards, would have been debated in Parliament when the legislation was passed.</p><p>Mr Chan said while each minister is responsible for exercising his or her assigned statutory functions, the most important issues are brought to the Cabinet for discussion before a final decision is made.</p><p>Ultimately, the Cabinet remains collectively responsible to Parliament, he said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In his speech, Mr Chan also covered how the public service is preparing for a rapidly changing international and domestic landscape.</p><p>MP Foo Cexiang (Tanjong Pagar GRC) and Nominated MP Sanjeev Tiwari asked how the public service was preparing its officers amid a changed global landscape and Singapore’s economic transformation.</p><p>Mr Chan outlined three core priorities for public officers – understanding the world, understanding the people, and understanding technology – which he said they would have to do well to ensure Singapore remains exceptional.</p><p>Given how small and open Singapore is, and how everything from trade to security and food is affected by global developments, it is crucial for public officers to understand the new world order to make sound decisions for Singapore, he said.</p><p>To help them build up global exposure and connections, the public service has ramped up overseas postings and attachments to international organisations and the private sector, he added.</p><p>As a result, nearly four out of 10 officers in the central leadership development programmes have had structured overseas exposure, he said.</p><p>Mr Chan also stressed the importance of understanding technology as the Government enhances science, technology and engineering capabilities across the entire public service.</p><p>As part of this push, all public officers are <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mandatory-ai-literacy-course-for-all-public-servants-leaders-must-be-open-to-using-ai-dpm-gan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:required to go through digital and AI training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">required to go through digital and AI training</a>, he added, with training for senior leaders accelerating over the past year to ensure readiness at every level, from permanent secretaries down to the newest officers.</p><p>At the same time, the public service is launching supplementary programmes under the Career Fitness Movement to provide targeted support for officers at different career and life stages, he added.</p><p>Mr Chan said the public service has also worked to further strengthen trust with Singaporeans, through initiatives such as the Singapore Government Partnerships Office, which was set up to foster collaboration between the Government and citizens. It received more than 1,600 partnership proposals in 2025.</p><p>“To ensure Singapore is ready for the future, our public service will equip our officers to understand the world, understand our people and understand technology,” he added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ministers-decisions-carefully-recorded-to-build-up-body-of-knowledge-says-chan-chun-sing?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
