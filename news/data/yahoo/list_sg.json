from the Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom to more modern F-15s and F-16s, according to the statement.</p><p>After retirement, Brown flew commercial cargo aircraft before joining two US defense contractors to

The rest of the time he trained Chinese pilots, it said.</p><p>“Brown’s alleged betrayal exposed sensitive military tactics, threatening the security of our nation, our armed forces, and our allies,” said FBI New York Assistant Director in Charge James Barnacle.</p><p>Aviation analyst Peter Layton of the Griffith Asia Institute, a former Royal Australian Air Force officer, told CNN that China could have learned a range of things from Brown.</p><p>“If I was China, I would also be most interested in ‘nuclear weapons delivery systems’ and the tactics planned to deliver nuclear weapons,” Layton said.</p><p>China could have also tried to learn what tactics F-35 pilots use to avoid detection in both offensive strike and air defense roles.</p><p>And Layton said US allies and partners are likely to be asking hard questions of the Pentagon.</p><p>“If I was an allied nation flying the F-35 I would be very strongly requesting what the US finds has been passed onto the Chinese. And what changes to tactics and procedures the US now suggests should be made,” Layton said.</p><p>But Layton said it’s possible as a simulator instructor, Brown may have just been training US pilots in basic flying, such as take-offs, landings and flying on instruments.</p><p>“So possibly no tactics,” he said.</p><p>Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said even gaining knowledge of those basic techniques could be useful to China.</p><p>Schuster told CNN that “the instructor pilot’s instincts in training and simulated combat flights tell us much about his past training…and what tactics the instructor’s air force of origin may employ in an intercept or ‘dog fight’ once engaged.”</p><p>“The instructor insights add context to the remotely collected technical intelligence-based information and open-source materials. You can build a very thorough and complete picture by fusing all that together,” he added.</p><p>The US attorney’s statement said Brown was eager to be training fighter pilots in China.</p><p>“In the resumé he prepared for his application, Brown wrote his ‘objective’ as ‘Instructor Fighter Pilot,’” it said, adding that later Brown told a co-conspirator upon his arrival in China: “Now…. I have the chance to fly and instruct fighter pilots again!”</p><p>Asked about the case at a briefing on Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment.</p><p>“I am not familiar with the situation you mentioned,” Mao said.</p><p>Brown allegedly made contact with China through a co-conspirator who was in contact with Stephen Su Bin, a Chinese national who in 2016 pleaded guilty to conspiring to give sensitive US military and export data to China and was sentenced to nearly four years in a US prison.</p><p>CNN anchor Jim <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/shadow-war-chinese-spy?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Scuitto wrote about Su’s case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Scuitto wrote about Su’s case</a> in his 2019 book, “<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062853646/the-shadow-war/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">The Shadow War: Inside Russia and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America</a><em>,</em>” saying Su and his partners stole tens of thousands of computer files related to the F-22 and F-35 fighters<em>.</em></p><p>Brown is not the first American flier to be charged with helping train Chinese pilots, nor the first to be linked to Su.</p><p>Former US Marine Corps pilot <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/australia/duggan-us-fighter-pilot-extradition-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Daniel Duggan was charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Daniel Duggan was charged</a> in 2017 of violating the Arms Export Control Act, specifically for allegedly helping Chinese pilots learn aircraft carrier operations.</p><p>Duggan, a naturalized Australian citizen, was arrested in New South Wales in 2022, and is pending extradition to the US.</p><p>He has denied the charges, claiming that US officials knew about his activities and that he was only training civilian pilots as China’s aviation sector boomed.</p><p>US authorities found correspondence with Duggan on electronic devices seized from Su Bin, Duggan’s lawyer Bernard Collaery said in a submission to Australian Attorney General Mark Dreyfus, according to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/australia/duggan-us-marine-pilot-australia-chinese-hacker-intl-latam?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a 2024 Reuters report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a 2024 Reuters report</a>.</p><p>Messages retrieved from Su Bin’s electronic devices show he paid for Duggan’s travel from Australia to Beijing in May 2012, according to extradition documents lodged by the United States with the Australian court, according to Reuters.

testified.</p><p>A couple days after Eric Richins was found dead on March 4, 2022, Lauber said she spoke with Kouri Richins on the phone.</p><p>“I said, ‘Please tell me these pills were not for him,’” Lauber recalled telling Richins.

She spoke with investigators several times before she was given immunity, which she said she did in part to take responsibility.</p><p>“I already knew Eric had passed away. But when they told – when they had mentioned that it was from an overdose, that hit hard,” Lauber said, dabbing her eyes with tissues.</p><p>“Only for the fact that, if that’s what happened, I needed to step up and take accountability of my part in this, what happened and what I was asked for.”</p><p>On cross-examination, the defense worked to undermine Lauber’s credibility, highlighting her history of drug use – including around the time she said she purchased the drugs in question – and the deal she reached with prosecutors to secure her testimony against Richins.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>‘A little clear baggie with some pills’</h3><p>Lauber testified she began obtaining illicit drugs for Richins around late January or early February of 2022.</p><p>Lauber bought an envelope of opiate pills from a woman she worked with and then gave them to Kouri Richins in her driveway the next morning, she said. Richins later asked for drugs a second time, saying the investor wanted something stronger, Lauber said.</p><p>Lauber testified she got in touch with a man who said he had pills containing fentanyl. When she texted Richins about the fentanyl pills, Richins responded, “Okay, go ahead and get them,” according to Lauber’s testimony.</p><p>Richins left Lauber approximately $1,000 cash inside of a house she was flipping, Lauber said. After she retrieved the money, Lauber said she met the man at a gas station on February 11, 2022.</p><p>“He handed me a little clear baggie with some pills in it,” she said.</p><p>Lauber testified she left the pills in the outdoor firepit of the same home where she picked up the money.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Kouri Richins tried to poison her husband a few days later, on Valentine’s Day, by lacing his sandwich. Eric Richins told his friends he broke out in hives and thought he was going to die after eating the sandwich, according to charging documents.</p><p>“I think my wife is trying to poison me,” he told one friend, per court records.</p><p>Around the end of February 2022, Richins again asked for stronger drugs, referencing “some of the Michael Jackson stuff,” Lauber confirmed in her testimony. Jackson died of a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/24/showbiz/michael-jackson-death-trial?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:propofol overdose;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">propofol overdose</a> in 2009.</p><p>Lauber testified she asked the same man for more pills and picked up $1,000 cash that Richins left in the same home. When she met the man at the gas station, he gave her a baggie of light blue pills, she said. Richins later picked up the pills in Lauber’s driveway, she testified.</p><p>When Eric Richins was found dead on March 4, 2022, he had roughly five times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system, according to charging documents.</p><p>Three days after her husband’s death, Richins texted Lauber “still have your hookup?” according to phone records displayed in court Thursday.</p><p>Lauber testified she then purchased drugs for Richins again after receiving a $1,300 check from her. The check, shown in court Thursday, was made out to Lauber for “Construction clean Midway.” At the time of Eric Richins’ death, his wife was working to flip a home in Midway, Utah.</p><p>“I never cleaned a house ever in my life for thirteen hundred dollars,” Lauber said.</p><p>Lauber later asked Richins if she needed any more pills, she testified. Richins allegedly responded she did not because her investor had “left town.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I8hJs61KPfv_g8alD7688g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5495469c8afd5f116cbbcbfb93ad7d20><noscript><img alt=\"Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I8hJs61KPfv_g8alD7688g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5495469c8afd5f116cbbcbfb93ad7d20 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Kouri Richins, left, and her late husband Eric Richins are seen in an undated photo Richins shared on social media. - From Kouri Richins</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Defense highlights deal for witness’ testimony</h3><p>Richins’ defense has worked to undercut Lauber, questioning her reliability based on purported inconsistencies in her statements and her history of drug use.</p><p>Lauber acknowledged her struggle with addiction Thursday, and said she has been sober for more than four years.</p><p>In her opening statement, defense attorney Kathy Nester said Lauber first told investigators Kouri Richins asked for another drug, oxycodone.

refugee in Buffalo, New York, days after Border Patrol agents dropped him off at a coffee shop alone, has prompted an investigation into the circumstances of his final days and drawn sharp criticism from the mayor, who called the incident “deeply disturbing.”</p><p>Nurul Amin Shah Alam, 56, who spoke little English, had been missing since February 19, when the agents left him at the shop shortly after he was released from the Erie County jail, officials said. His body was found five days later, around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, about four miles from the coffee shop, the Buffalo Police Department said.</p><p>The Erie County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy and determined Shah Alam’s cause of death was health‑related. Exposure and homicide have been ruled out, Buffalo city spokesperson Nick Beiling said.</p><p>It is not clear what exactly the nature of the health condition was, Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan said at a news conference Thursday. CNN has asked the medical examiner for its full report, which the mayor said he has not seen yet.</p><p>“The Border Patrol officers had no protocol of what to do with a disabled man who doesn’t speak English, who is confused and lost. And you know what they did? They dropped him at a closed coffee shop. That’s why we do not cooperate with ICE, Homeland Security and Border Patrol,” Ryan said.</p><p>Buffalo Police said its “homicide detectives are investigating the circumstances and timeframe of events leading up to his death, following his release from custody.”</p><p>Ryan said he would be releasing a timeline of the police department’s actions going back to Shah Alam’s initial arrest last year.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://www.buffalony.gov/m/newsflash/home/detail/1614\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wednesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Wednesday</a>, the mayor called Shah Alam’s death “preventable” and insisted CBP “answer for how and why this happened.”</p><p>There are still many unanswered questions about what led to Shah Alam’s death.

Keane told CNN in a statement Thursday.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/1003916133/Bpd-Arrest\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:police report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">police report</a> obtained by <a href=\"https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/local/bpd-searching-for-missing-adult/71-df084550-6431-4bbb-86a4-fc15e8eaf124\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN affiliate WGRZ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN affiliate WGRZ</a> showed Shah Alam was being held on two counts of assault with intent to cause injury to an officer, a count of possession of a weapon and trespassing, among other charges, before a plea deal was reached.</p><p>He was arrested in February 2025, following what one of his children described to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/near-blind-refugee-found-dead-buffalo-after-release-by-us-border-patrol-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Reuters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Reuters</a> as a misunderstanding with police. Shah Alam had been out for a walk and was using a curtain rod as a walking stick when he got lost and wandered onto private property, his son Mohamad Faisal said. When he did not understand officers’ commands to drop the rod, Shah Alam was arrested.</p><p>In body camera video of the incident, obtained by WGRZ, Shah Alam is seen walking through a yard with what appears to be two black poles. He appears to wave the poles in the direction of the officers, before they fire stun guns, the video shows. Shah Alam is then tackled and handcuffed.</p><p>At Shah Alam’s arraignment on the indictment in June 2025, his bail was modified to $5,000 cash or bond, but he remained in custody as the case moved to its trial date, the district attorney’s office said.</p><p>In early February, Shah Alam pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges with prosecutors and defense attorneys agreeing that he would remain in custody on bail pending a sentencing hearing set for March 24, Keane said.</p><p>“In this matter, the reduced disposition appropriately held the defendant accountable for the crime while avoiding a penalty that would be unduly harsh and disproportionate to the offense,” Keane said.</p><h3>His family didn’t know where he was dropped off</h3><p>Shah Alam was released from jail last week after his bond was posted on February 19, Keane said. It’s unclear who posted bond for him or what changed to lead to his release.</p><p>CNN has reached out to an attorney for Shah Alam.</p><p>As Shah Alam’s discharge from jail was being processed, deputies notified US Border Patrol, which had earlier placed him under an immigration detainer, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>“U.S. Border Patrol arrived at the Holding Center prior to the finalization of Mr. Shah Alam’s release from Erie County Sheriff’s Office custody,” the statement said.</p><p>A spokesperson for CBP said the agents later determined Shah Alam had entered the United States as a refugee on December 24, 2024, and “was not amenable to removal.”</p><p>“Border Patrol agents offered him a courtesy ride, which he chose to accept to a coffee shop, determined to be a warm, safe location near his last known address, rather than be released directly from the Border Patrol station,” the statement said. “He showed no signs of distress, mobility issues or disabilities requiring special assistance.”</p><p>Upon learning that Shah Alam was ineligible for removal, Border Patrol agents, using a translator program, attempted to communicate with him, according to a federal law enforcement official who said that Shah Alam asked to be taken to the location where he was eventually left. He was offered an opportunity to make a phone call but declined, the official said.</p><p>Ryan, the mayor, criticized the series of events by Border Patrol, saying there were ways they could have contacted someone to help Shah Alam.

Some money in the most recent release went to two tribes in California, but not the state itself.</p><p>“This week, FEMA released over $5 billion in recovery funding for projects, some dating back as far as 15 years — a significant win for states, local governments, and hospitals,” a FEMA spokesperson said. “To be clear, this is about results, not politics.”</p><p>“Regarding which projects are being funded, FEMA is prioritizing based on project readiness and strict oversight. Obligations are made when projects meet all necessary criteria. Decisions are not based on political considerations; the process is focused on merit and accountability,” the spokesperson added.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, DC, on February 13. - Michael M.

26, 2026. - George Walker IV/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>A federal prosecutor in Nashville who secured criminal charges last year against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national who was illegally deported by the Trump administration, attempted to convince a federal judge on Thursday to not toss out the case based on a finding that it was likely vindictively pursued.</p><p>The high-stakes hearing was the latest flashpoint in a sprawling web of court cases Abrego Garcia has been ensnared in since his hasty deportation last March to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador and the administration’s initial reluctance to bring him back came to symbolize President Donald Trump’s slapdash and contentious approach to immigration enforcement.</p><p>But the criminal case Abrego Garcia was brought back to the US to face last year has essentially been on life-support in recent months after US District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found evidence of a “realistic likelihood” that he’s the target of a vindictive prosecution that was pursued, in part, by high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington, DC.</p><p>Over several hours of testimony before Crenshaw on Thursday, Robert McGuire, who is leading the prosecution, repeatedly stressed that department leaders in Washington played no role in bringing the pair of human smuggling charges against Abrego Garcia and that he was the one calling all the shots in the matter.</p><p>“Who made the decision to seek an indictment of Mr. Abrego?” Associate Attorney General Stan Woodward asked McGuire at one point.</p><p>“I did,” McGuire replied, adding that nobody at the Department of Justice’s headquarters asked him to pursue the charges.</p><p>“The charging decision – that was my decision,” McGuire said. “I wanted to feel good about it on my own.”</p><p>That Thursday’s hearing happened at all is a remarkable turn of events in a criminal case that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373969491112\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:once described as “strong.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">once described as “strong.”</a> The department had for months tried to avoid being put in the awkward position of having to defend its prosecution of Abrego Garcia but amid the legal wrangling, it’s been forced to turn over some internal communications that appeared to undermine the assertions made by McGuire last year and again on Thursday.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The integrity of the case has come under serious doubt by Crenshaw in recent months as he’s assessed Abrego Garcia’s claim that he’s being prosecuted in retaliation for successfully challenging his wrongful deportation, concluding that the Maryland father of three has shown evidence of a “realistic likelihood” that he’s the target of a vindictive prosecution. That determination could soon lead him to throw out the case.</p><p>Requests by criminal defendants for judges to toss out charges based on their claim that they’re being vindictively prosecuted face extremely high hurdles in court and are overwhelmingly unsuccessful because of how difficult it can be to connect prosecutors’ decisions to a retaliatory motive.</p><p>McGuire on Thursday tried to brush aside any notion that such a connection exists in Abrego Garcia’s case. He said communications he had last spring about the case with an official working under Blanche were only meant to keep his office abreast of key developments in his pursuit of charges.</p><p>“I wasn’t asking Mr. Singh’s permission or asking him to buy in on it,” he said, referring to Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh, who oversees dozens of US attorneys around the country.</p><p>But those comments could do little to sway Crenshaw, who said in a major ruling last year that a trove of internal documents “suggest” the prosecutor worked with department officials in Washington, “who may or may not have acted with an improper motivation.” The judge specifically pointed to Singh, saying he played a “leading role” in prosecutorial decisions in the case.</p><p>“The court said (Singh) played a leading role. That’s just not true,” said McGuire, who now serves as a top-ranking prosecutor in the office.</p><p>McGuire also insisted that Abrego Garcia’s case was similar to other human smuggling cases he’d handled in the past. He said that after reviewing an officer’s body camera footage from a 2022 Tennessee interstate highway traffic stop the charges stem from, “I was immediately struck by how similar what was being depicted in the body cam was to those other” human smuggling cases.</p><p>But, he added, he wouldn’t have pursued charges based on the footage alone. Other evidence gathered before charges were sought bolstered his decision to ask a grand jury last May to approve the two counts.</p><p>“There were a lot of things that told me … ‘OK, this really looks like a human smuggling operation,’” he said.</p><h3>Case on shaky ground</h3><p>Two key decisions last year by Crenshaw revealed the shaky ground the case was on. The appointee of former President Barack Obama said that the burden is on the government to fend off a presumption that officials only reopened a yearsold probe into Abrego Garcia, and subsequently asked a grand jury to approve charges, to punish him for filing a lawsuit challenging his deportation.</p><p>“The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego’s success in the Maryland lawsuit and deterring any future efforts in that lawsuit,” Crenshaw wrote in his first ruling in October.</p><p>In that decision, the judge carefully laid out key moments leading up to Abrego Garcia’s indictment that appeared to support his claim that officials only reopened their investigation into him in response to his winning streak in the deportation case. He specifically called out public statements made by Blanche on the day Abrego Garcia was arrested that “directly linked the Maryland lawsuit to the investigation of criminal behavior by Abrego.”</p><p>“At minimum, this suggests the (administration’s) frustration with Abrego, and that his case was not a run-of-the-mill prosecution,” he wrote. “Even assuming the individual motive of Acting US Attorney McGuire was pure, others’ motives, like fruit from a poisonous tree, may taint this prosecution.”</p><p>Two months later, Crenshaw made public excerpts of several emails between McGuire and Singh in which Singh said prosecuting Abrego Garcia is a “top priority” for the department and subsequent messages that showed McGuire providing updates and draft charging documents to Singh as he moved toward asking a grand jury to approve the charges.</p><p>Under questioning from David Patton, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, McGuire said he didn’t know whether Singh was sharing information from their conversations with Blanche, Attorney General Pam Bondi or other Trump administration officials.</p><p>“Nothing happened that came back to me,” he testified.</p><p>That the government decided against calling Singh or Blanche as witnesses at the hearing could prove consequential since the judge has already signaled dissatisfaction with the representations made by McGuire about the charging decisions.</p><p>But if Crenshaw decides that the testimony provided Thursday is enough to refute his preliminary finding from last year, it’ll set up another round of court proceedings in which he’ll have to resolve a request from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers for him to summon Blanche and Singh to Nashville to testify at yet another hearing.</p><p>McGuire has previously argued that even if others in the administration “have alleged ill will” toward Abrego Garcia, “there is nothing before the court to establish that such alleged ill will actually motivated the prosecution.”</p><p>He said in a sworn statement last September that he “never received any direction” from officials at DOJ headquarters “that was unethical or inappropriate” and that choosing to charge Abrego Garcia “was the correct legal decision.”</p><p>Also on the witness stand Thursday was Rana Saoud, a former agent with the Department of Homeland Security’s investigatory office in Nashville, who similarly testified that her decision to reopen a yearsold probe into Abrego Garcia was not the result of any undue influence from officials in Washington.</p><p>Saoud said she first learned about the 2022 traffic stop that the investigation – and criminal charges – stems from after someone sent her a local news article about it and that Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit challenging his deportation “had nothing to do with it at all.”</p><p>“We’re not swayed by political posturing,” she said, adding later that at the time, she wouldn’t have talked to any leaders at the department, including Secretary Kristi Noem, about the newly reopened probe.</p><p>“That is well above my level,” she said.</p><h3>Rare hearing</h3><p>Legal experts said that Crenshaw’s earlier rulings have put the government on notice that the case is quickly unraveling.</p><p>“It is exceedingly rare that, as here, the evidence triggers the presumption of a vindictive prosecution that the government must rebut. This puts the government’s counsel on their heels,” said retired federal Judge John Jones.</p><p>“The government’s witnesses are going to have to try to explain away a determination to prosecute Abrego Garcia that came from Main Justice and only after he was released,” Jones added. “From the defense’s standpoint, this is a lawyer’s dream.”</p><p>Abrego Garcia has been on pre-trial release in Maryland and is simultaneously fighting off efforts by the administration to re-deport him, this time to a country other than El Salvador. He attended Thursday’s hearing, but sat silently in the well of the courtroom as the two witnesses took the stand, following their testimony with the help of interpreters.</p><p>His initial deportation to that country, which he is from, violated a 2019 court order that expressly prohibited officials from sending him back because he feared gang violence there.</p><p>After a federal judge in Maryland said the government needed to work to “facilitate” his return, officials resisted complying with her order for months, but eventually partnered with El Salvador to return him in early June. He was arrested on the human smuggling charges when he returned to American soil.</p><p>Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the pair of charges, which stem from the 2022 stop that was the subject of a federal investigation that closed days before he was deported last March.</p><p>Prosecutors elected to not bring charges following the stop, but in the indictment secured last year, they alleged that the nine Hispanic male passengers who were in the car with Abrego Garcia were being smuggled as part of a yearslong international smuggling ring that he was involved in.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
