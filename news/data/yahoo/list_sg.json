has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.</p><p>CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system. Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.</p><p>The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.</p><p>Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, where a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.</p><p>Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many account for 90% of the world’s arsenal, <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide#toc-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"

expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.</p><p>China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/politics/china-suspected-silo-fields-report?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"

nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.</p><p>When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”</p><p>“They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”</p><p>The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.</p><h3>A new arms race?</h3><p>Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.</p><p>The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.</p><p>But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.</p><p>“If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.</p><p>Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.</p><p>When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.</p><p>“I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”</p><p>A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”</p><p>The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.</p><p>North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.</p><p>After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.</p><p>There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/asia/nuclear-testing-china-russia-us-exclusive-intl-hnk-ml?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN reported in 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN reported in 2023</a> that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>“There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.</p><p><em>CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Kennedy couldn’t get a response from the child and came away from the encounter “shocked.”</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t just senators who heard from Kennedy about what he’d seen.

I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation, you can tell from their faces, from their body movements and from their lack of social connection,” RFK Jr. said during a ceremony in Texas where Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ceremonially signed multiple pieces of MAHA legislation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>RFK Jr. is not a doctor, though even if he were one, it’s not clear if it would be possible to diagnose “mitochondrial challenges” by passing people on an airport concourse.</span></p><p><span>One of the new policies Abbott signed, a ban using SNAP benefits for sweetened drinks and candy, is set to take effect next April. Kennedy Jr. suggested the policy could help America return to better days: the time of his youth, when he didn’t know anyone with diabetes or autism, before his uncle and father were murdered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We have more chronic disease than any country in the world, and we know what it is, and we know it’s the food that we’re eating,” he said. “We’re doing something horrible to our children.”</span></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-federal-employees-forced-out_n_690240fce4b0f553c4350aff?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump’s Latest Milestone: Forcing 211,000 People Out Of Their Federal Jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump’s Latest Milestone: Forcing 211,000 People Out Of Their Federal Jobs</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-third-term-update_n_6901841fe4b0522875e88c4c?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;It&#39;s Pretty Clear&#39;: Trump Gives Surprise Update On 2028 &#39;Third Term&#39; Talk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">&#39;It&#39;s Pretty Clear&#39;: Trump Gives Surprise Update On 2028 &#39;Third Term&#39; Talk</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hasnt-been-necessary-more-than-national-guard_n_6901dbcbe4b0a85834080493?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump Elaborates On His New Threat And Jabs At Reporter Who Asks About It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Trump Elaborates On His New Threat And Jabs At Reporter Who Asks About It</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-food-stamps-soda-ban-maha_n_6901009ae4b09e9402366e84?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>From a deal to reduce tariffs slapped on China to planned cooperation on ending the war in Ukraine, here&#39;s what Beijing and Washington say was achieved during Donald Trump and Xi Jinping&#39;s first face-to-face talks in six years:</p><p>- Fentanyl -</p><p>The fentanyl trade has long been a sore point in relations between China and the United States: Washington accuses Beijing of turning a blind eye to the illegal trade in the drug, a charge it denies.</p><p>Trump hit China with a 20 percent levy on Chinese imports over complaints about its exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl.</p><p>However, he said after the talks in Busan the tariffs would be reduced to 10 percent -- bringing overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 percent.</p><p>Trump said Xi &quot;agreed that he was going to work very hard to stop the flow&quot; of the powerful opioid, which has killed thousands of Americans.</p><p>&quot;I believe he&#39;s going to work very hard to stop the death that&#39;s coming in,&quot; Trump told reporters on Air Force One.</p><p>- Hill of beans -</p><p>Beijing retaliated against Trump&#39;s fentanyl tariffs with levies against US agricultural products, including soybeans.</p><p>More than half of US soybean exports went to China last year, but Beijing halted all orders as the trade dispute deepened.</p><p>US farmers have been badly hit by the tariff war and are a key source of domestic political support for Trump.</p><p>Trump said China had now agreed to purchase &quot;tremendous&quot; amounts of soybeans, as well as other farm products.</p><p>&quot;That was a very nice gesture,&quot; he said of the talks that he described as a &quot;great meeting&quot;.</p><p>- Rare earths -</p><p>A strategic field dominated by China that is essential for manufacturing in defence, automobiles and consumer electronics, rare earths were expected to occupy a central role in the Busan talks.</p><p>Beijing imposed sweeping export controls on the materials and related technology this month.</p><p>Trump swiftly announced retaliatory tariffs of 100 percent on all Chinese goods, which were originally due to come into effect on Saturday.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But the US leader insisted on Thursday that &quot;that whole situation, that roadblock is gone now&quot;.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no roadblock at all on rare earths -- that will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary,&quot; he said, without giving details.</p><p>China&#39;s commerce ministry confirmed the restrictions on rare earths had been suspended &quot;for one year&quot;.</p><p>Washington in turn agreed to suspend for one year a move imposing &quot;Entity List&quot; export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies in which they had at least a 50 percent stake, a Chinese spokesperson said.</p><p>The United States also agreed to suspend for one year its Section 301 investigation into China&#39;s shipbuilding industry that led to both sides applying port fees against each other&#39;s ships, they said.</p><p>China would suspend its &quot;countermeasures&quot; after the US action, they added, also for one year.</p><p>- Ukraine -</p><p>Trump said the United States and China have also agreed to cooperate more on seeking an end to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>China says it is a neutral party in the conflict, but Kyiv and Western governments have long accused Beijing of providing political and economic support to Moscow.</p><p>Trump told reporters the subject had come up &quot;very strongly&quot; during his talks with Xi.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s going to help us, and we&#39;re going to work together on Ukraine,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>- Chips -</p><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>US chip giant Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle. Nvidia&#39;s chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;We did discuss chips,&quot; Trump said after meeting Xi, adding that Huang would speak to Beijing about the dispute.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re sort of the arbitrator or the referee,&quot; Trump said.</p><p>Huang is currently in Gyeongju, South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit, which Xi is also expected to attend.</p><p>aue-oho-mya/je/hmn</p></div></article></div>",

after a high-stakes meeting between US and Chinese leaders that resulted in an agreement to alleviate frictions between the world&#39;s two largest economies.</p><p>US President Donald Trump described his meeting in South Korea with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- their first since 2019, during Trump&#39;s first term -- as &quot;amazing&quot;.</p><p>Xi said they had reached &quot;consensus&quot; on economic and trade issues, according to state media in Beijing.</p><p>Stock market reactions were subdued, with Japan&#39;s main benchmark closing flat following a widely expected central bank decision to hold interest rates steady.</p><p>Shanghai and Sydney closed with moderate drops, while Hong Kong rallied from an afternoon fall to finish just slightly lower on the day.</p><p>Seoul finished slightly up, helped partly by tech giant Samsung Electronics posting a 32 percent rise in on-year third quarter profits and strong automotive gains.</p><p>Taipei finished the day largely flat.</p><p>The meeting between Trump and Xi came after days of a tech-fuelled bull run in global markets, boosted further by an interest rate cut in the United States, confirmed on Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p><p>However, Powell&#39;s announcement also cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar.</p><p>The Nasdaq later recovered, finishing at a fourth straight record after another gain by artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value.</p><p>Attention had been laser-focused on the Xi-Trump meeting in the South Korean city of Busan.</p><p>Trump said the talks yielded an extendable one-year deal on China&#39;s supply of crucial rare earths, materials that are essential for sophisticated electronic components across a range of industries.</p><p>He said tariffs imposed over China&#39;s export of chemicals used to make the deadly drug fentanyl would be reduced to 10 percent -- bringing overall US tariffs on Chinese goods to 47 percent.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump also said China had agreed to purchase &quot;tremendous&quot; amounts of soybeans, as well as other farm products.</p><p>Xi urged teams from the two countries to &quot;finalise follow-up work as soon as possible&quot;, calling for &quot;tangible results to set minds at ease about the economies of China, the United States and the world&quot;, state news agency Xinhua said.</p><p>Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said: &quot;The reversal of some US tariffs on China won&#39;t have a big impact given that Chinese exporters had largely shrugged them off.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the de-escalation takes the immediate threat of large tariff hikes off the table, removing a key downside risk to the near-term outlook,&quot; he wrote in a note.</p><p>London and Paris dropped at the start of trading in Europe, while Frankfurt&#39;s main benchmark was up slightly.</p><p>- Key figures at around 0830 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225:&nbsp;FLAT at 51,325.61 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index:&nbsp;DOWN 0.2 percent at 26,282.69 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite:&nbsp;DOWN 0.7

In the past two months, its regulators have asked the U.S. chipmaker to explain whether the H20 chip posed backdoor security risks and cautioned domestic firms over purchases.</p><p>At a Citadel Securities event this month, Huang bemoaned that the tit-for-tat actions had slashed Nvidia&#39;s market share for advanced AI chips in China from 95% in 2022 to virtually zero.</p><p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, also speaking aboard Air Force One, said that after Trump&#39;s meeting with Xi, Nvidia would talk to China and see what was possible.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s so many chips we already sent to China, a lot of advanced chips.&quot;</p><p>But two people familiar with discussions in the Chinese market said they were skeptical that Beijing would quickly change its stance on Nvidia chips, adding that China did not want to settle for inferior chips since the H20 was far behind the Blackwell in performance and it believed that domestic rivals could catch up with the H20 soon.</p><p>One said they would still be willing to consider the downgraded version of the Blackwell chip, dubbed the B30A, if Washington approved its sales to China.</p><p>The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the situation is a sensitive one.</p><p>(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Eduardo Baptista; Additional reporting by Fanny Potkin and Che Pan; Writing by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Clarence Fernandez)</p></div></article></div>",

More job cuts are on the horizon as businesses prioritise artificial intelligence transformation, including the automation of administrative and coordination tasks, said human resource experts.</p><p>The latest cuts came from Amazon, which announced on Oct 28 that it was making 14,000 corporate jobs redundant globally amid a wider adoption of AI internally.</p><p>Jobs in Singapore will likely not be spared, with data entry, basic coding, administrative support, reporting and coordination roles the most at risk due to AI disruption, said experts. They also noted that most firms had already addressed the manpower bloat post-Covid-19.</p><p>“We must be ready for bloodied onslaughts here as AI accelerates displacement in automatable tasks, hitting routine cognitive work hardest,” said Dr David Leong, chief executive of human resources consulting firm PeopleWorldwide.</p><p>Since AI excels at entry-level white-collar jobs, half of all data entry, basic coding and admin support, among others, could be gone in five years, he said.</p><p>AI dashboards provide real-time insights will also replace many middle management roles, Dr Leong added.</p><p>The massive cuts at Amazon, attributed to efficiency gains from AI, follow similar layoffs announced in 2025 by software company Salesforce, social media giant Meta and airline Lufthansa Group.</p><p>Mr David Blasco, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Singapore, said that AI transformation will also affect industries in different ways.</p><p>In the tech sector, the impact of AI is more pronounced as they tend to be early adopters of automation and AI-driven solutions.</p><p>“This positions them to sandbox and implement technologies that can rapidly replace certain functions, especially middle-skilled or white-collar positions,” said Mr Blasco.</p><p>”At the same time, tech companies face constant pressure to optimise efficiency and profitability, while balancing the significant upfront cost of AI investment before realising measurable cost savings.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In contrast, sectors such as corporate banking and healthcare place greater value on human intuition and judgement, which are capabilities that AI has yet to fully replicate, Mr Blasco added.</p><p>Mr Blasco also said that he is seeing more roles being redesigned to meet demands for greater specialisation and advanced skill sets.</p><p>Experts also said that this year’s job cuts are also meant to equip firms for new business opportunities.</p><p>“What’s driving investor enthusiasm, corporate valuations and stock performance is confidence in the transformative power of artificial intelligence,” said foreign exchange company RationalFX data analyst Alan Cohen.</p><p>Concurring Dr Leong said: “It’s more of a manpower reallocation to stay competitive in an AI arms race.”</p><p>Mr Cohen noted that global trade tensions and US tariffs are also creating uncertainty and increased costs that further accelerate workforce reductions.</p><p>The silver lining is in AI development, data science, cybersecurity and product strategy as these require some form of human oversight, said Mr Cohen.</p><p>Mr Blasco said there is also a strong demand for operations-critical roles like cybersecurity, as companies strengthen their defences against growing volumes of complex digital threats.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bloodied-onslaughts-experts-warn-of-ais-growing-impact-on-office-jobs?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

sidelines of an international summit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the sidelines of an international summit</a> in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.</p><p>The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.</p><p>Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.</p><p>“Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.</p><p>The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls on rare earth minerals, in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.</p><p>In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.</p><p>Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.</p><p>China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.</p><p>One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.</p><p>On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.</p><p>The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bdRtLwpIYEoE8eG097Ma2w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c415e34cdfc60f39e7318ba07be857c2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping react after posing for photos ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.</p><p>“We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.</p><h3>Troubled trade</h3><p>The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.</p><p>At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.</p><p>Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.</p><p>Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.</p><p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”</p><p>Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.</p><p>Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track.
