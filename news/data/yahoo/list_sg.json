At worst, it distances the politician from the way the rest of us communicate, Hart said.

businesses.</p><p>Anxiety over chip shortages began when the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to effectively take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government.</p><p>China, in response, banned any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of meddling in Dutch legal procedures to remove Nexperia&#39;s Chinese CEO.</p><p>Beijing blamed what it said on Saturday was &quot;the Dutch government&#39;s improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises&quot; for leading to &quot;the current chaos in the global supply chain&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,&quot; a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said in a statement, without offering specifics.</p><p>The resumption of some Nexperia shipments was part of a trade deal agreed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US counterpart Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources.</p><p>Chinese and European Union officials were also to discuss Nexperia while meeting in Brussels, EU spokesman Olof Gill had said.</p><p>Those talks on Friday were &quot;a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on... the introduction and implementation of export controls&quot;, Gill said in a statement on Saturday.</p><p>The discussions covered &quot;controls on rare earth elements introduced or proposed by China, as well as an update on controls and developments on the EU side&quot;, he said.</p><p>The statement did not mention Nexperia specifically.</p><p>Nexperia produces relatively simple technologies such as diodes, voltage regulators and transistors that are nonetheless crucial as vehicles increasingly rely on electronics.</p><p>Its chips are mainly found in cars but also in a wide range of industrial components, as well as consumer and mobile electronics such as refrigerators.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

Europe.</p><p>The chipmaker supplies 49 percent of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry, according to German financial daily Handelsblatt.</p><p>The European auto lobby ACEA warned last month that production would be seriously hit.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s chips, while widely used, are not &quot;unique&quot; in terms of technology and therefore &quot;easily substitutable&quot;, French parts maker OPmobility said.</p><p>However, suppliers must get the new products approved by automakers, which takes time.</p><p>Beijing suggested on Saturday that some

roof collapse, marking a year since the tragedy that sparked the biggest protests in decades.</p><p>People placed flowers and candles along temporary fencing near the damaged station entrance, where 16 people were killed when its canopy collapsed on November 1, 2024.</p><p>&quot;I feel ... great pain and sadness,&quot; Svetlana, a 45-year-old woman told AFP, summarising the feeling of mourners who stood in silence.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people are expected to rally for the commemorations that will start at the station at 11:52 am (1052 GMT), the time when the tragedy occurred, with 16 minutes of silence observed for 16 victims.</p><p>Since the tragedy, which became a symbol of entrenched corruption, Serbia has been gripped by regular student-led protests.</p><p>Protesters first demanded a transparent investigation, but their calls soon escalated into demands for early elections.</p><p>Students, who called for the &quot;largest commemorative gathering&quot; on Saturday, and others, have been pouring into Novi Sad since Friday, arriving by car, bicycle, or on foot.</p><p>Thousands marched from Belgrade for some 100 kilometres (62 miles), or even from Novi Pazar, around 340 kilometres south of the capital. It took them a symbolic 16 days -- for the 16 victims -- to finish the march.</p><p>Late Friday, residents of Novi Sad took to the streets to greet the marchers, blowing whistles and waving flags, many visibly moved.</p><p>&quot;I came to bow to the strongest force in the world right now -- our students, our youth,&quot; said Ratko Popovic from the Novi Sad region.</p><p>The 47-year-old, who arrived with his family, praised the &quot;unity of all the people in Serbia who are against corruption, against crime, against the ruling party&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Conscience guides us&#39; -</p><p>&quot;Our conscience is what guides us, it&#39;s what makes us act in this way, to finally bring justice and a better tomorrow to this country,&quot; Luka Kovacevic, medical student from Novi Sad, told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The protests have led to the resignation of the prime minister, the collapse of his government and formation of a new one. But nationalist President Aleksandar Vucic has remained defiantly in office.</p><p>Vucic regularly labelled demonstrators as foreign-funded coup plotters, while members of his SNS party push conspiracy theories claiming that the train station roof collapse may have been an orchestrated attack.</p><p>But in a televised public address on Friday, Vucic made a rare gesture and apologised for saying things that, he said, he now regretted.</p><p>&quot;This applies both to students and to protesters, as well as to others with whom I disagreed. I apologise for that&quot;, Vucic said and called for a dialogue.</p><p>The government has declared Saturday a day of national mourning while head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC) Patriarch Porfirije is to serve a mass for the victims at the Belgrade Saint Sava church.</p><p>Vucic supporters, camping outside the parliament for months against the university blockades in support of the government, said they would gather in front of the church to pay respect to the victims.</p><p>&quot;On this sad anniversary, we appeal to everyone ... to act with restraint, to deescalate tensions and to avoid violence&quot;, the European Union delegation in Serbia said in a statement.</p><p>The protests have remained largely peaceful but in mid-August they degenerated into violence that protesters blamed on heavy-handed tactics by government loyalists and police.</p><p>In September, 13 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic were charged in a criminal case over the collapse.</p><p>A separate anti-corruption probe continues alongside an EU-backed investigation into the possible misuse of EU funds in the project. </p><p>oz-al-ljv/ach</p></div></article></div>",

Their ages range from 16 to 20s.</p><p>Patel <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1984222011158102097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984222011158102097%7Ctwgr%5Efb814abd787b46d2132a2744b5da52a10d9f253a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freep.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fmichigan%2F2025%2F10%2F31%2Fterrorist-attack-michigan-fbi-halloween%2F87006356007%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on X</a> the FBI “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan who were allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”</p><p>“The FBI swept out from the Detroit field office last night and through this morning, taking people into custody, executing search warrants and doing subpoenas for phones, computers and other material,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said Friday.</p><h3>How the alleged plot was uncovered</h3><p>The ISIS-inspired plot unfolded in online chatrooms, according to the two law enforcement officials.</p><p>An FBI undercover person was introduced into the chatroom in the early stages of discussion, the officials added.</p><p>“This all relates to an investigation that started months ago into people who were communicating online with each other here in the United States … but also talking to people overseas, possibly connected to ISIS,” said Miller, citing conversations with law enforcement officials who had been briefed.</p><p>The participants discussed whether to carry out an ISIS-inspired plot in the US – “though what that plot was, when that plot would be, what the target would be, was unclear as they discussed various options in terms of timing,” Miller said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>It’s not clear what the two people arrested were charged with and whether charges have been filed.</p><p>Miller said the FBI moved in this week when a group of people who were being monitored “went to a shooting range with AK-47s and other weapons, fired a large number of rounds of ammunition, practiced tactical high-speed reloads, and in the discussions it was picked up a reference to what we’re told is ‘pumpkin day’ – a possible reference to Halloween.”</p><p>The individuals taken into custody had discussed in their communications whether they were ready to carry out an attack, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said. Some said they needed more time and training, but a younger member of the group had said that it was time to act, two officials added.</p><p>There was also a discussion at one point about taking a one-day trip to New York City to see the sights, including visiting Rockefeller Center and looking at the Statue of Liberty, the officials said. There was no talk about the trip being a reconnaissance for an attack, but the conversation caught the attention of both the FBI and the NYPD as the investigation continued.</p><h3>‘No current threat to public safety’</h3><p>The FBI’s Detroit field office confirmed “the FBI in Michigan were present in the cities of Dearborn and Inkster … conducting law enforcement activities,” spokesperson Jordan Hall told CNN.</p><p>“There is no current threat to public safety.”</p><p>The Dearborn Police Department said it “has been made aware that the FBI conducted operations in the City of Dearborn.”</p><p>“We want to assure our residents that there is no threat to the community at this time,” the police department said.</p><p>In the city of Inkster, the FBI carried out “law enforcement activities at a storage facility located on Michigan Avenue,” Police Chief Tamika L. Jenkins said.</p><p>She said local FBI agents confirmed there is no threat to residents. But to assuage any concerns, Inkster police “will have additional personnel deployed throughout the evening to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those participating in Halloween festivities,” the police chief said.</p><p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the FBI and Michigan State Police.</p><p>“I was briefed by Director Patel on the thwarted potential terrorist attack in our state,” she posted on X. “As details continue to develop, I am grateful for the swift action of the FBI and MSP protecting Michiganders.”</p><p>CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz, Nicki Brown and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

But government attorneys admitted this week that Guard soldiers were already at the facility – and remained there for hours after her order.</p><p>Though Immergut filed her restraining order at 3:40 p.m. PT on October 4, Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton told her as many as 10 soldiers were at the facility until midnight. Earlier, his colleague Jean Lin had said the troops were there until 2 a.m.</p><p>The judge briefly pressed the Trump administration on whether the soldiers’ presence might have been in contempt of her order, questioning why the government would deploy those Guard members while knowing her ruling on the restraining order was imminent.</p><p>“The government deployed that very night that I told you I would issue an opinion,” Immergut said. “Does that not seem in bad faith?”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton replied, adding that the Guard members were needed at the ICE building prior to the judge’s ruling.</p><p>Immergut questioned why the Oregon National Guard members didn’t vacate the ICE facility for hours after her restraining order was issued, yet California troops were able to arrive in Oregon by the next day.</p><p>“Doesn’t that seem odd?” she asked.</p><p>Hamilton told her the direction to comply with her order “went high up in the chain of command,” and a four-star general was involved. He argued it took time to implement the order. “There are steps that it has to go through.”</p><p>“My clients were working to end the mission,” Hamilton said.</p><p>The issue was tabled after Immergut suggested there could be a separate hearing on the potential order violation.</p><h3>ICE facility official was surprised by Guard deployment</h3><p>Top officials charged with the safety of the Portland ICE facility were not consulted before Trump ordered National Guard troops to Portland in September, one of those officials testified.</p><p>A deputy regional director for the Federal Protective Service, identified in court by the initials R.C., said he and his boss, the FPS regional director, found out about the order on the news.</p><p>“I was surprised,” R.C. said.</p><p>“Your first thought was ‘What would I do with 200 National Guard men?’” asked Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General Brian Simmonds Marshall.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” R.C. said, admitting he already had a large number of FPS and supporting agents staffing the ICE facility.

Bailey agreed, saying troopers were scheduled to start later in the evening.</p><p>R.C, the high-ranking official with the Federal Protective Service, said demonstrators that night threw broken glass, rocks and debris at federal agents. There was also an attempt to “breach the facility,” the official said.</p><p>Officers that night considered using deadly force if protesters entered the building, saying they may have to “go lethal,” according to R.C.</p><p>“Protesters were putting chains on the door,” R.C. said. “It shows an attempt to lock the officers in and create a hazard for the team that was there.”</p><p>He added that two FPS officers were injured from fireworks thrown at the building and an ICE employee required medical attention after being hit with an object.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Federal agents hold back protesters while deploying a smoke grenade outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland on October 4, 2025. - Spencer Platt/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ofcC0zlmsDFc6pGR0EuOiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/455f6a0a8f56fc31fc6a6d89e0ab69d5><noscript><img alt=\"Federal agents hold back protesters while deploying a smoke grenade outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland on October 4, 2025. - Spencer Platt/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ofcC0zlmsDFc6pGR0EuOiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/455f6a0a8f56fc31fc6a6d89e0ab69d5 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Federal agents hold back protesters while deploying a smoke grenade outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland on October 4, 2025. - Spencer Platt/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Davis also sought to establish that federal officers were getting little help from Portland police by outlining several incidents in which rocks were thrown at the ICE facility without any arrests. One report logged people “using slingshots to shoot cameras” at the ICE facility, he said.</p><p>Attorneys for Oregon and Portland maintain Trump’s lawyers are seizing on a small sample size of dates that ended in violence, instead of a vast majority of nights that remained peaceful.</p><p>Portland Police Commander Franz Schoening testified that managing these demonstrations can become complicated because the city’s sanctuary laws limit how officers are able to interact with crowds outside the immigration facility.</p><p>“We will not engage in immigration-related enforcement or participate in activities” that could be related to it, Schoening said. That includes clearing crowds in front of the ICE driveway, so the task was left to federal agents, he said.</p><p>Officers are also restricted from assisting federal agents if they have begun to deploy munitions like pepper balls and tear gas, Schoening said, citing a law passed in 2020 that limits Portland’s participation with agencies using such munitions.</p><h3>‘Unpredictable’ use of force can create safety risks, police commander says</h3><p>The Portland police commander highlighted starkly different approaches between federal and local law enforcement in handling the protests, saying federal tactics sometimes contribute to the chaos.</p><p>Portland police often have different interpretations of the level of threat outside the ICE facility, Schoening said, including on October 18, when federal agents used munitions on the crowd.</p><p>“We simply didn’t see that (as necessary),” Schoening said.</p><p>That night, police witnessed a federal officer launching tear gas canisters that “skipped off of their driveway and went onto the roof of the ICE facility where other officers were standing.”</p><p>That prompted those federal officers to deploy more munitions, he said. “Our officers were impacted by those munitions.”</p><p>The commander said he was “startled” to see the amount of force often employed by federal agents, noting it was “disproportionate to the level of criminal conduct we are seeing down there.”</p><p>The use of force against demonstrators has at times threatened the safety of nearby Portland officers, Schoening added. When federal agents use “indiscriminate force,” he said, including the “unpredictable” use of chemical crowd dispersal agents, local police do not get a warning.</p><p>“Officers face safety risks themselves,” he said.</p><p>The Trump administration, however, argues federal agents face systematic disruption and assault from protesters that justifies a more forceful response.</p><p>“It is a frequent occurrence for agitators to carry bats, improvised weapons and shields,” Hamilton told the court.</p><p>Hamilton said the protesters have displayed “disturbingly intrusive behavior” and organized violence. “The agitators coordinate their activity, including their information-gathering techniques.”</p><p>The government also dismissed the state’s claim that National Guard presence escalates the tensions on the ground, saying there is no substantive evidence that has occurred.</p><p>“It is totally speculative that there will be inflamed tensions and that inflamed tensions would impact plaintiffs in any way,” Hamilton said.</p><p>CNN’s Josh Campbell contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

than a decade (-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung hosted Xi Jinping for their first meeting on Saturday as the Chinese head of state took centre stage and reforged old ties at an Asian summit from which US leader Donald Trump was largely absent.</p><p>The talks on the sidelines of the APEC gathering came on the final day of Xi&#39;s first trip to South Korea in more than a decade and a day after his meeting with Canada&#39;s premier that was a reset of the nations&#39; damaged ties.</p><p>Trump had flown to South Korea for the summit, but promptly jetted home Thursday after sealing a trade war pause with Xi, with the two agreeing to dial down a dispute that has roiled markets and disrupted global supply chains.</p><p>Trump&#39;s departure left the Chinese leader to take centre stage at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where he framed Beijing as a responsible power against the chaos unleashed by the United States on the international order.</p><p>Lee welcomed Xi at a grand opening ceremony complete with soldiers wearing traditional garb.</p><p>The visit was the Chinese leader&#39;s first since 2014 and comes after years of strained ties over everything from trade to cultural disputes.</p><p>Lee told Xi he had &quot;long looked forward to meeting you in person&quot; and framed his trip as a reset in relations.</p><p>&quot;As our two countries move from a vertical structure of economic cooperation to a more horizontal and mutually beneficial one, we must work together to build a relationship that delivers shared prosperity,&quot; Lee told Xi, whose vast economy represents South Korea&#39;s largest trading partner.</p><p>Xi, in turn, described China and South Korea as &quot;important neighbours that cannot be moved and also partners that cannot be separated&quot;.</p><p>Lee also pitched China as a partner in South Korea&#39;s efforts to rekindle frayed ties with the North, with which it remains technically at war.</p><p>Stressing the need for &quot;stability&quot; in the region, Lee noted &quot;recent high-level exchanges between China and North Korea&quot; -- a reference to leader Kim Jong Un&#39;s recent attendance at a major military parade in Beijing.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Those meetings, Lee said, &quot;are helping to create conditions for renewed engagement with Pyongyang&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hope that South Korea and China will strengthen strategic communication... and work together to resume dialogue with the North,&quot; Lee told Xi.</p><p>Ahead of Lee and Xi&#39;s meeting, Pyongyang had dismissed Seoul&#39;s hopes for denuclearisation as a &quot;pipedream&quot; which &quot;can never be realized even if it talks about it a thousand times&quot;.</p><p>- Passing the baton -</p><p>Earlier in the day, Lee passed the APEC baton to Xi, who will host next year&#39;s summit in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.</p><p>With the US president absent, the Chinese leader has used APEC to reach out to countries with which Beijing has had frosty relations.</p><p>Xi met on Friday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the event -- the first formal talks between the two countries&#39; leaders since 2017.</p><p>Xi told the Liberal leader he was determined to work together to get relations back on the &quot;right track&quot; and invited Carney to visit China.</p><p>Carney on Saturday described the meeting as a &quot;turning point&quot; in ties between Ottawa and Beijing.</p><p>Canada&#39;s relations with China are among the worst of any Western nation.</p><p>But the two can find common ground as both are at the sharp end of Trump&#39;s tariff onslaught, even after Xi and the US leader&#39;s deal Thursday to dial back tensions.</p><p>Carney said Saturday he had apologised to Trump over an anti-tariff ad featuring former US leader Ronald Reagan that sent the president into a rage, leading him to cancel trade talks and slap additional 10 percent tariffs on Canada.</p><p>Trade talks would restart when the United States was &quot;ready&quot;, Carney said.</p><p>And, he said, he had accepted Xi&#39;s invitation to visit &quot;in the new year&quot;.</p><p>Xi also sat down on Friday with Japan&#39;s premier Sanae Takaichi for the first time since she was appointed in October.</p><p>Takaichi, Japan&#39;s first woman prime minister, has long been seen as a China hawk and has been a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan&#39;s war dead, a site that angers China and South Korea.</p><p>She told Xi that she wanted a &quot;strategic and mutually beneficial relationship&quot;.</p><p>cdl-oho/mtp</p></div></article></div>",

judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits for the month of November. President Donald Trump said later Friday he’d instructed administration lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits, adding that if “given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”</p><p>But he noted that even immediate guidance from the courts would result in delayed benefits for food stamp recipients — which could still only be <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F10%2F31%2Fpolitics%2Fsnap-benefits-november-judge-ruling&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cclay.voytek%40cnn.com%7C589414c2bcbb40be354608de18e8d989%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638975585516164725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cNhFv6G7sCssFEdUcFDqwPnzsvWBNTseezgAeykjQzw%3D&amp;reserved=0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a partial and short-term fix;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a partial and short-term fix</a>. Tens of millions of Americans are still bracing for a crisis that will leave them without the government assistance they need to eat, heat their homes or take care of their kids while they work.</p><p>And after a week abroad, Trump announced his return with a missive that threatens to further complicate the path out of the shutdown: calling for eliminating the Senate filibuster in a “nuclear” move that even his closest congressional allies worry would only do more damage in the long run.</p><p>“Right now, the problem is everybody wants to win,” GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia, who has advocated for Trump to get more directly involved in negotiations to reopen the government, said of the standoff in the Senate. “And you’ve got a lot of people really hurting, and that really upsets me.”</p><p>“I imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” fumed Sen.

Chris Coons, a centrist Democrat from Delaware, told CNN, referring to the spiking premiums that his party has made a central demand in the funding fight. But he said phone lines would, too, be lighting up for Democrats.</p><p>“I also think Democrats are going to get a flood of calls from people saying, wait, wait a minute. My SNAP and WIC is going to be…? So I think there will be building pressure on both parties to find a path forward.”</p><p>Behind the scenes, Senate and House GOP leaders are confident Democrats will cave shortly after the November 4 elections, several of the sources said. Many point to a flurry of talks with some centrist Democrats to end the shutdown, perhaps in exchange for a vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that remain Democrats’ biggest demand in the funding fight, as well as a commitment to full-year spending bills.</p><p>“I hope it frees people up to move forward with opening government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Election Day on Tuesday, claiming Democrats would be more willing to yield when they’re not “concerned about turnout” in key races in Virginia and New Jersey.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dFFFVHw2ZTm0MasLZUluhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/df618adc850e92a86e46e5f2a7194ecb><noscript><img alt=\"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dFFFVHw2ZTm0MasLZUluhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/df618adc850e92a86e46e5f2a7194ecb class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson arrives to speak during a news conference outside of his office at the US Capitol on the second day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC, on October 2. - Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Yet several people close to Democratic leaders insist the party is unwilling to back down for a show vote. After more than 30 days of insisting on a clear commitment on the health care issue, many Democrats will be unswayed by unofficial commitments: They want to hear directly from Trump.</p><p>As the shutdown has dragged on, even some Republicans have grown antsy as Johnson has kept the House out of session since September 19 and lawmakers have remained in their districts.</p><p>“People ask, ‘Do you like being here in the district?’ Of course I do because I get to see all of my constituents,” GOP Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters on Tuesday from Washington. “But I also would tell you that we are built to work here. We are all built to be here and doing our jobs and late nights and early mornings and trying to figure out a path forward. And so, it’s a little unusual.”</p><p>Many House lawmakers concede they don’t know what will happen if the shutdown extends past November 21, the date of the House-passed government funding extension.</p><p>Democrats also pointed to Trump’s late-night call for nuking the filibuster, which injected fresh uncertainty into the situation and raised further questions about the role the president might play in resolving the shutdown.</p><p>In a Friday statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that “if Democrats won’t do what’s best for the American people, the nuclear options will need to be invoked,” though she did not offer a specific timeline. Top GOP leaders, meanwhile, were quick to swat away the suggestion of weakening the custom, while maintaining that Trump and Republicans in Congress were united in ending the shutdown without ceding any ground to Democrats.</p><p>That includes Trump’s resistance to any further meetings with Hill leaders, despite constant requests from Democratic senators.</p><p>Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, shot down GOP leaders’ offer earlier this month to guarantee a vote on the floor on ACA subsidies in exchange for Democratic votes to end the shutdown, quipping, “I’m not sure that Leader Thune is really the leader of the Senate.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ofod1ixEKhDztjDp9b8S.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/be7df60948159a3e7db0431457909dcc><noscript><img alt=\"US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ofod1ixEKhDztjDp9b8S.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/be7df60948159a3e7db0431457909dcc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on October 31, in West Palm Beach, Florida. - Samuel Corum/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>White House officials have insisted that their stance remains unchanged, and that there won’t be any negotiations until Democrats cave and reopen the government.</p><p>“Let them open up the country, and we’ll meet,” Trump said Friday. “We’ll meet very quickly. But they have to open up the country.”</p><p>But in the days before Trump returned to the US, aides had privately discussed options for enticing Democrats to give in, including agreeing to undo the administration’s recent mass firing of federal workers in exchange for reopening the government, two people familiar with the deliberations told CNN.</p><p>Those conversations were preliminary and did not yield any final decisions, the people familiar cautioned, especially amid concerns that it would hand Democrats an opportunity to claim they won the shutdown fight.</p><p>Another suggestion discussed by GOP officials — that Trump invite Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House next week to try to broker an end to the impasse — was swiftly ruled out.

And while the expiration of food aid has pushed more Democrats to seek an end to the shutdown, it’s also worried a swath of Republicans who represent the millions of red-district voters reliant on SNAP — and are already under pressure over high prices, health care and other economic issues.</p><p>“The question becomes, who politically gets the blame?” said one GOP adviser involved in the shutdown discussions. “If Republicans are really feeling the tide shifting on that one there may be a more political imperative to get this solved.”</p><p>Within Trump’s orbit, aides and advisers are largely resigned to the shutdown blowing past the 35-day record set during his first term, three people close to the White House said.</p><p>Yet they are still holding out some hope that the impasse won’t last much beyond Tuesday’s elections, believing Democrats are increasingly eager to find an off-ramp.</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, insist it’s Trump who needs to offer them one.</p><p>“We could end this at any moment, if we can get the right people in the room, and that includes the president.
