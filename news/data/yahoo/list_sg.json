ELLIS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Britain&#39;s ruling Labour party&nbsp;slumped Friday to a humiliating third-place finish as it lost a crunch vote in a traditional stronghold to the left-wing Greens, heaping fresh pressure on&nbsp;embattled Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Labour&nbsp;also&nbsp;finished behind the hard-right, anti-immigration&nbsp;Reform UK party in Thursday&#39;s by-election for the Gorton and Denton parliamentary seat in northern Manchester, as the country&#39;s traditional two-party system fractures.</p><p>The&nbsp;result,&nbsp;in a constituency Labour has dominated for decades,&nbsp;shows how the centre-left party is being squeezed by both ends of the political spectrum, and&nbsp;is likely to fuel speculation about how much longer 63-year-old Starmer can stay in office.</p><p>It also suggests that Britons appear more willing to look towards insurgent parties for answers on long-standing, hot-button issues like the high cost of living and irregular immigration.</p><p>Shortly after the result was announced early Friday, Green leader Zack Polanski told volunteers the party was &quot;here to replace&quot; Labour.</p><p>This &quot;is what replacing looks like,&quot; added Polanski, a charismatic figurehead some liken to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, and who only took charge of the Greens last September.</p><p>Ex-deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the result &quot;must be a wake-up call&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If we want to make the change we were sent into government to make, we have to be braver,&quot; the Manchester MP added.</p><p>- &#39;Threat&#39; -</p><p>Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber, won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably to become&nbsp;the&nbsp;Greens&#39; fifth&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;MP in the 650-seat British parliament.</p><p>&quot;We defeated the parties of billionaire donors,&quot; she told jubilant supporters.</p><p>The contest&nbsp;was triggered by ex-lawmaker Andrew Gwynne resigning on health grounds.</p><p>Labour had won the July 2024 general election in a landslide, sweeping Starmer to power and ousting the Conservatives after 14 years in office.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But&nbsp;his&nbsp;government has since been beset by policy reversals, resignations and rows, including over the appointment of Peter Mandelson, an associate of&nbsp;late US&nbsp;sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as Britain&#39;s ambassador to Washington.</p><p>Polls suggest Starmer is now the most unpopular British prime minister since surveys began, and earlier this month he faced down calls from within his own party to resign.</p><p>The next general election is not expected until 2029, but the defeat will intensify pressure on him ahead of May local elections, when the party is predicted to also perform poorly.</p><p>University of Manchester politics lecturer Louise Thompson said it showed Starmer must now &quot;fight a war on two fronts&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Whereas previously he&#39;s focused in a much more laser-like way on Reform... Labour will need to take the Green threat much more seriously,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Values&#39; -</p><p>The Greens had never won a parliamentary by-election before, and ran a grassroots campaign that sought to mobilise the constituency&#39;s 28 percent Muslim population.</p><p>The party, which under Polanski has embraced a full-throated left-wing agenda including higher taxes on the wealthy, is avowedly pro-Palestinian.</p><p>In a likely harbinger for upcoming elections, its campaign was less focused on environmental concerns -- the party&#39;s traditional rallying cry -- and more concerned with cost-of-living pressures and other issues.</p><p>The result was a blow for Brexit champion Nigel Farage, whose Reform party has led national polls for the past year. He called it &quot;a victory for sectarian voting&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Roll on the (local) elections on May 7th,&quot; Farage added. &quot;It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party.&quot;</p><p>Starmer has spent much of his time in office targeting Reform, in particular by toughening Labour&#39;s immigration policies and rhetoric.</p><p>But the stance appears to be alienating elements of the party&#39;s left-wing base and young people.</p><p>Andrea Egan, the new leftist leader of the traditionally Labour-supporting UNISON union, said the Greens had won &quot;because Labour under Starmer has abandoned progressive values, imitating the far-right instead of taking the fight to them&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If the government wants to survive it urgently needs to stand up for workers and defend the fundamental values of our movement,&quot; she added on X.</p><p>bur-jj/mp/st</p></div></article></div>",

These entities will need to disclose foreign donations and affiliations, and meet leadership composition requirements,” he added.</p><p>Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesperson said it was still assessing the list of entities that will be designated.</p><p>“Each designation decision will be made holistically, and the list of designated entities will be made public when ready,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>MHA added it had engaged both clans and business associations when developing the new measures.</p><p>“Overall, the feedback was supportive. Race-based entities understood and accepted the need for the baseline safeguards to mitigate foreign interference risk,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>Meanwhile, a proposal will also be tabled to amend the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mha-to-boost-laws-to-tackle-drugs-foreign-threats-road-safety-concerns\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica)</a> to guard against evolving hostile tactics.</p><p>This will allow the Government to invoke Fica to issue directives against digital platforms such as websites and mobile apps if they believe the platforms are being used to run HICs against Singapore.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Said Mr Tong: “Security threats such as radicalisation, foreign interference, scams, and drugs, are very much driven by external actors. These risks increase when the geopolitical environment becomes more fragmented and disorderly.”</p><p>He noted that hostile foreign actors have become increasingly sophisticated and harder to detect, and are now employing digital tools to launch websites masquerading as credible sources to launch HICs.</p><p>In 2024, Singapore authorities<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-blocks-10-foreign-linked-websites-in-crackdown-of-potential-hostile-disinformation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:identified 10 websites,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> identified 10 websites,</a> masquerading as local websites, that were set up by foreign actors and connected to global networks known to have conducted influence operations in other countries.</p><p>MHA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) directed internet access service providers here to block access to the 10 websites for users in Singapore.</p><p>Said Mr Tong: “We will propose to allow the Government to issue anticipatory directions against mediums of online communications, including websites and mobile applications, should there be indications that they may be used to mount an HIC against Singapore, before they cause actual harm.”</p><p>Under current laws, the Government relies on the Broadcasting Act to block websites deemed to run HICs.</p><p>Mr Tong said that in today’s landscape, emotive and sensitive issues such as race and religion can be more easily exploited by foreign actors to deepen fault lines within the society and manipulate Singaporeans to be aligned with foreign interests at the expense of the nation’s interest.</p><p>“We must therefore continue to strengthen our safeguards against foreign interference.”</p><h2>Radicalised youth</h2><p>Turning to recent examples of overseas terror attacks, Mr Tong reminded Singaporeans that terrorism and violent extremism can take place anytime.</p><p>In November 2025, a 17-year-old student who was inspired by far-right extremists <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/several-injured-after-explosion-at-school-complex-in-indonesian-capital-local-media-reports\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:detonated four explosive devices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">detonated four explosive devices</a> in a Jakarta school mosque, injuring around 100 people.</p><p>A month later, two gunmen with anti-Semitic beliefs <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/at-least-16-dead-after-shooting-at-sydneys-bondi-beach-police-declare-terrorist-incident\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:opened fire at a Jewish gathering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">opened fire at a Jewish gathering</a> at Bondi Beach in Sydney, killing 15 and injuring several others.</p><p>“We cannot discount the possibility of similar attacks here,” said Mr Tong, adding: “The internet has enabled such ideologies to proliferate and reach Singaporeans on their screens, often on their mobile screens.”</p><p>Since 2015, the Internal Security Department (ISD) has dealt with 62 self-radicalised individuals in Singapore.</p><p>Youths have been targeted, with three 14-year-olds dealt with under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for terrorism-related activities, over the past two years.</p><p>“Youths are particularly susceptible. They are digital natives, and they find belonging and purpose in virtual communities,” said Mr Tong.</p><p>In November 2025, a teenager was<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/isa-restriction-order-issued-for-sporean-boy-14-who-recreated-isis-executions-on-roblox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:issued a restriction order under the ISA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> issued a restriction order under the ISA</a> prohibiting him from travelling out of Singapore or accessing social media without approval.</p><p>He had been radicalised online after watching a video of ISIS fighters battling American soldiers in Iraq, later spending up to nine hours a day consuming extremist content.</p><p>Mr Tong said that next week, the Government will launch a refreshed SGSecure campaign that will shift the focus towards actions Singaporeans can take before, during, and after a terrorist attack.</p><p>He said: “We hope Singaporeans will respond to the call to action, stay vigilant, and pick up skills and knowledge to help keep ourselves and fellow Singaporeans, and those around us, safe.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/designated-race-based-clan-business-associations-must-disclose-donations-from-foreign-sources-mha?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

GIMANOV)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Looking out at the blue and yellow cranes towering over the Black Sea horizon, Viktor Berestenko worries about the relentless Russian bombardment of Odesa, Ukraine&#39;s southern port city.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s war, every night,&quot; the head of the Inter Trans logistics company told AFP.</p><p>The main gateway to the Black Sea and beyond, Odesa is a key logistics hub for Ukraine, one of the world&#39;s top agricultural exporters.</p><p>Russia has intensified its attacks on the region -- tripling the number of missile and drone strikes over the last year in what officials call an attempt to cut Ukraine off from the sea.</p><p>&quot;Without ports, Ukraine will be destroyed,&quot; said Berestenko.</p><p>The escalation comes four years into Russia&#39;s invasion, in which Ukraine&#39;s maritime infrastructure has been a target for Moscow.</p><p>The attacks are accepted as part of daily life for the city of around one million people, dotted with ornate 19th-century architecture and where luxury cars pass mobile air defence units along the bustling seaside.</p><p>Russia&#39;s army occupies much of Ukraine&#39;s southern coast, including key port cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk further to the east.</p><p>And in 2023 Moscow walked away from a deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey, that facilitated the safe passage of Ukrainian agricultural exports across the Black Sea.</p><p>In response, Kyiv set up an alternative route with vessels hugging the sea&#39;s western coastline from Odesa, along Romania, Bulgaria and through the Bosphorus into the Mediterranean.</p><p>Ukraine touts it as a success, with more than 170 million tonnes of cargo transported through the route, including grain to some 55 countries, mostly in Africa.</p><p>The sales provide a vital source of income for the economy, decimated by the Russian invasion.</p><p>But the surge in strikes is taking a toll.</p><p>Volumes were down 15 percent last year, when some 57 ships and 336 pieces of port equipment were damaged, according to Mykola Kravchuk, head of the state-run Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority in the city.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There were more than 800 air raid alerts in Odesa in 2025 -- &quot;this amounts to more than a month of operational time lost over the course of the year,&quot; Kravchuk told AFP.</p><p>The vast majority of Ukraine&#39;s grain exports go through Odesa.</p><p>- Two-minute warning -</p><p>Incoming ballistic missiles can hit Odesa within two minutes of being launched from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.</p><p>It takes some 45 seconds for a crane operator to climb down, let alone reach a shelter, Berestenko said.</p><p>He scrolled through photos on his phone of burned-out trucks and warehouses damaged by strikes.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s scary, to put it briefly,&quot; said Iryna, who works at the port&#39;s container terminal.</p><p>&quot;When the alarm sounds, we go down... we put our trust in God,&quot; the 41-year-old&nbsp;said.</p><p>&quot;Sometimes alerts can last for three hours, and we sit there.&quot;</p><p>Several strikes have killed port employees or ship crew members.</p><p>In

Mr Chee was Transport Minister then.</p><p>Mr Tong, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs, was addressing Parliament on the emerging risks MHA was monitoring.</p><p>One of which was the different risks EVs posed as compared to traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles when they catch fire.</p><p>Said Mr Tong: “While research has shown that fires in electric vehicles are less likely than in internal combustion engine vehicles, EVs pose different risks when they catch fire, and require a different management approach.”</p><p>He said MHA and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will continue studying the use of differentiated licence plates for traditional vehicles and for EVs, to address the emerging fire safety risks.</p><p>The Land Transport Authority and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told The Straits Times they will engage the motor industry and EV owners for their views on the proposal.</p><p>The agencies said: “The proposed EV identifier (EVI) designs must ensure visibility and ease of identification. There will only be one common EVI design for EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Only AMDs that meet these standards can be imported into and used in Singapore.</p><p>MOT will also tighten regulations in 2026 over the online sale and advertising of AMDs.</p><p>This comes even though the number of AMD fires in Singapore dropped from 67 in 2024 to 49 in 2025. Of those, 34 cases occurred in residential premises.</p><p>Those convicted of using non-compliant AMDs can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.

Methamphetamine remains the most commonly abused drug in Singapore, reflecting the worldwide trend,” said Prof Faishal.</p><p>In 2025, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) dismantled 25 drug syndicates and seized over $21 million worth of drugs. To aid their work, the Government will be amending the Misuse of Drugs Act.</p><p>Prof Faishal said: “We will introduce a presumption clause for hair test results. This means that if a controlled drug is found in a person’s hair, they will be presumed to have abused it. This gives CNB a stronger tool for enforcement, since hair tests can detect abuse over a longer period.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/separate-car-plates-being-studied-for-evs-in-spore-to-warn-scdf-public-in-cases-of-fire-mha?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

with the estate of Latchford -- who died in Bangkok in 2020.</p><p>Before the scandal came to light, Latchford earned acclaim&nbsp;for books detailing the art of the ancient Khmer Empire, which spanned modern-day Cambodia and much else of Southeast Asia.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Hun Many told reporters the return of the artefacts was a matter of &quot;national pride&quot; because the pieces &quot;connect the national soul from our ancestors&#39; era to the current time&quot;.</p><p>The objects, to form part of the collection at the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, include &quot;monumental sandstone sculptures, refined bronze works, and significant ritual objects&quot;, said a culture ministry statement.</p><p>&quot;These 74 sacred objects are not merely works of art; they are living witnesses to the genius of the Khmer ancestors and the spiritual heart of Khmer civilization,&quot; it added.</p><p>In 2024, New York&#39;s Metropolitan Museum of Art returned 14 artefacts looted by Latchford, including a 10th century sandstone goddess statue and a large 7th century Buddha head.</p><p>Thousands of relics are believed to have been trafficked out of Cambodia over the years.</p><p>Experts say the trade thrived from the mid-1960s to the 1990s -- a period of instability that saw the anti-intellectual Khmer Rouge regime rise to power and left precious heritage unprotected.</p><p>Since 1996 Cambodian law has forbidden the unauthorised removal of antiquities, with a prison punishment of up to eight years.</p><p>Growing numbers of museums and private collections worldwide are facing pressure to repatriate artworks removed from their native countries, particularly those looted during periods of colonial rule.</p><p>suy/jts/fox</p></div></article></div>",

become a &quot;consolation prize&quot; for Russian President Vladimir Putin amid intense efforts to end the Ukraine war.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya said it was crucial for Ukraine to win its battle but that Belarus, a close ally of Moscow under current leader President Alexander Lukashenko, should not be sacrificed.</p><p>&quot;It is important for us that Europe represents the Belarusian voice during these negotiations as well, that we don&#39;t separate the Ukrainian and Belarusian case, that Belarus is not given as a consolation prize to Putin,&quot; she said on the sidelines of a visit to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.</p><p>Ukrainian and US negotiators held fresh talks in Geneva on Thursday on efforts to end Russia&#39;s invasion, now into a fifth year. Further Ukraine-Russia-US talks could be held in Abu Dhabi in March, according to Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Russia is demanding Ukraine pull its troops out of territory Kyiv&#39;s army still controls -- a proposal Zelensky has rejected -- and said there is no deadline for ending the conflict.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya said that if Russia succeeded with its conditions, &quot;it will keep the status quo in Belarus for decades, and Belarus can be used as a launching pad, as a place for escalating deployment of different types of weapons, threatening, blackmailing (its) neighbours for years and years ahead&quot;.</p><p>Russia used Belarusian territory to launch its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, announced in December that Russian ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons had been stationed in his country.</p><p>Tikhanovskaya, now 43, stood against Lukashenko in a 2020 presidential election that the opposition say she won.</p><p>Official results however awarded the victory to Lukashenko, triggering major demonstrations and a brutal crackdown, forcing Tikhanovskaya into exile.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Strong cards&#39; -</p><p>Tikhanovskaya originally went to Lithuania but confirmed that she is moving to Warsaw.</p><p>Lithuanian officials lowered her security status last year and several of the opposition leader&#39;s associates said the Belarus government had made threats.</p><p>&quot;I personally lived in Vilnius for five years. Honestly I was always sure that the next city I would move from Vilnius would be Minsk. But the situation is like it is,&quot; she said.</p><p>She now campaigns for the estimated 1,200 political prisoners in Belarus while planning for ways to change the country, and also jointly works with the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog that counts 46 countries as members.</p><p>She would like the European Union to toughen its sanctions against Lukashenko&#39;s government over its role in the Ukraine war.</p><p>&quot;I want to explain to the Europeans that they have such strong cards... to help us to release the country,&quot; said Tikhanovskaya.</p><p>The Belarus people want to be &quot;European&quot;, she added, while admitting that its 30 years under Lukashenko&#39;s rule would make it difficult to quickly gain EU membership.</p><p>&quot;A huge shift took place in minds of the people&quot; with the 2020 demonstrations, she said.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s impossible to turn this page of our history.

Roberts had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-tariffs-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:written the court’s main opinion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">written the court’s main opinion</a> striking down the Trump administration tariffs, then waited weeks as colleagues finished their various additional opinions.</p><p>The seven separate opinions in the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Learning Resources v.

Trump</a> tariffs case demonstrated how a case can become a forum for airing larger doctrinal differences.</p><p>Or, sometimes, the justices simply want to vent.</p><p>The result can be a lack of clarity in the law as the general public, along with lawyers and judges, navigate competing views.</p><p>The number of concurrences – writings by a justice who signs onto the majority’s bottom-line but adds a separate angle – has been rising at the contemporary court. That’s a reflection of increased polarization and shows that justices within the standard conservative and liberal blocs often splinter in their legal reasoning and approach.</p><p>Roberts’ opinion for the majority in the tariffs dispute was an efficient 21 pages. The principal dissenting opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, stretched to 63 pages. But then four other justices, who’d sided with Roberts, wrote concurring opinions: Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The most expansive came from Gorsuch, at 46 pages. Clarence Thomas added a separate dissenting opinion.</p><p>The writings totaled 164 pages, with another six for the accompanying syllabus.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“I felt very left out in the tariffs case,” Alito told Bursch drolly. “Justice Sotomayor didn’t write and I didn’t write.”</p><p>Rejoined Sonia Sotomayor, as the others chuckled, “Maybe we’ll have a chance here.”</p><p>Quips aside, the competing views in the dispute over Trump’s assertion of unilateral power for tariffs on foreign goods surprised the legal community.</p><p>“I was struck with just how many and how long the separate opinions were,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith. “Justice Gorsuch’s opinion was notable for pointedly throwing down the gauntlet, at his colleagues, which had the effect making all of them feel they had to write more in response.”</p><h3>Why justices are writing more</h3><p>In prior decades, justices tended to write concurring opinions to make clear the limits of a majority ruling, said Galbraith, an international law scholar who earlier served as a law clerk to the late Justice John Paul Stevens.</p><p>“Concurrences these days are often being used for big brush strokes,” she said, “for laying out and defending broad judicial philosophies. That’s what was going on in the tariff opinions.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A portion of the opening text in the US Supreme Court&#x002019;s decision in Learning Resources Inc. v.

Trump concerned modes of statutory interpretation more than the nuts-and-bolts of tariff policy. Such seemingly abstract differences can often consume the members of the country’s highest court more than which side wins or loses.</p><p>Similarly, in a 2024 dispute over the Second Amendment, the justices by an 8-1 vote (Thomas dissented) <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/supreme-court-guns-rahimi?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:upheld a federal law;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">upheld a federal law</a> prohibiting individuals subject to a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing a gun. Then, in addition to Roberts’ opinion for the majority, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:five other justices wrote concurring opinions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">five other justices wrote concurring opinions</a> detailing their views on the constitutional and historical inquiry when determining whether a gun-control measure breaches the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p><p>Adam Feldman, who researches Supreme Court patterns and is the author of the <a href=\"https://legalytics.substack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Legalytics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Legalytics</a> substack, documented a 42% increase in written concurring opinions from 2000 to 2024. He said the court averaged roughly 64 concurrences per 100 majority opinions in 2000–2009, compared to about 80 per 100 opinions in 2019–2024, with a pronounced rise since the mid-2010s.</p><p>For years, Thomas led the court in such supplemental writings as he laid out his distinct conservative approach to the Constitution. The newest justice, Jackson, on the left wing, is now close to rivaling Thomas.</p><p>Since 2022 when she joined the bench, Jackson has authored 29 concurring opinions, Feldman found, topped only by Thomas at 35 concurrences for the same period.</p><p>For comparison, at the other end of the spectrum, the liberal Kagan penned just five concurrences over the past three-and-a-half years. Roberts, who controls many of the court’s most important opinions, wrote only one concurring statement.</p><h3>Justices increasingly spar in the footnotes</h3><p>An otherwise little-noticed January dispute over federal court procedure illustrated Jackson’s tendency. Barrett had the majority in the case, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-440_1b82.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Berk v. Choy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Berk v. Choy</a>, and wrote an 11-page decision signed by all other justices but Jackson.</p><p>Jackson agreed with Barrett’s conclusion that a Delaware affidavit requirement for medical malpractice cases does not apply in federal court. But she strongly disagreed with the Barrett majority over which rules of civil procedure applied.</p><p>Jackson laid out her reasoning, across 13 pages and six footnotes, some of which tussled with Barrett over how each was interpreting (or “contorting”) the rules.</p><p>At one point, Jackson asserted that a Barrett assumption “jumps the gun.” Barrett responded with a footnote asserting, “we do not ‘jump the gun,’ but rather cut to the chase.”</p><p>All seven of the justices who wrote opinions in the tariff dispute last Friday dropped asides in the footnotes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/21/politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-tariffs-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Roberts trained his fire;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Roberts trained his fire</a> on Kavanaugh’s dissent, noting that Kavanaugh had suggested Trump could impose “most if not all” of the disputed tariffs under statutes other than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p><p>Responded Roberts: “We do not speculate on hypothetical cases not before us.”</p><p>Later, as he rejected Kavanaugh’s reliance on a 1981 case, Roberts insisted that the court had stressed the narrowness of that ruling at least five times in its opinion. “That is not quite ‘no, no, a thousand times no,’ but should have sufficed to dissuade” Kavanaugh from using it.</p><h3>Major questions for one another</h3><p>Much of the separate writing in the tariffs case addressed how a legal approach known as “the major questions doctrine” should be applied. The theory holds that if Congress wants to delegate significant economic or political power to the president, it must do so clearly in a statute.</p><p>Roberts concluded that Congress had not granted such tariff power under IEEPA, as Trump had claimed.</p><p>“(T)he President must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,” Roberts wrote.</p><p>Gorsuch agreed with Roberts’ take but then used the occasion to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/22/politics/supreme-court-tariffs-major-questions-doctrine-gorsuch-kavanaugh-kagan?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:criticize other justices’ approaches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">criticize other justices’ approaches</a> to interpreting statutes under the major questions doctrine, largely based on their past writings.</p><p>Barrett fired back that Gorsuch was mischaracterizing her position, saying, “he takes down a straw man. I have never espoused that view.”</p><p>Kagan, a critic of the constraints imposed by the “major questions” approach, noted in her separate writing that Gorsuch was “insisting that I now must be applying the major-questions doctrine, and his own version of it to boot. Given how strong his apparent desire for converts, I almost regret to inform him that I am not one.”</p><p>The desire for converts can indeed motivate a lengthy concurrence. As much as the justices were, by turns, relitigating past cases and defending their positions in the dispute at hand, they were laying out the groundwork for future cases.</p><p>As Gorsuch remarked as he closed out his 46 pages, “if history is any guide, the tables will turn….”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
