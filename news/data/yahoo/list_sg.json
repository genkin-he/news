slain opposition figure Boris Nemtsov.</p><p>The symbolism was almost too much.</p><p>Four years into Moscow&#39;s full-scale offensive on Ukraine, which has seen President Vladimir Putin eradicate all forms of dissent and usher in strict military censorship laws that have silenced his critics, few Russians dared, or wanted, to pay tribute.</p><p>Nemtsov, a longtime Putin opponent, was shot and killed on February 27 2015, metres from the Kremlin&#39;s red walls. He was 55.</p><p>Hundreds used to flock to the makeshift memorial on the anniversary of his death, which came on Friday.</p><p>This year, there was barely a trickle.

Still, his murder shocked the country and the world.</p><p>&quot;The hopes of the whole country were pinned on him -- of all the people who wanted it to be free here,&quot; said Olga Vinogradova, a 66-year-old volunteer who tends to the pop-up memorial to Nemtsov on the bridge.</p><p>&quot;When this man was killed, naturally, all of us were, we were all just executed at that moment. Because our hopes were destroyed,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;With this memorial, we remind people that there was a different path for Russia. And that there was a real person who could have led us down this path.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Forced out&#39; -</p><p>Nemtsov had strongly opposed Putin&#39;s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and Moscow&#39;s military backing for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>He was also a close and early ally of Alexei Navalny, who died in 2024 in an Arctic prison in what his supports say was a poisoning.</p><p>Open opposition to the Kremlin is unheard of inside Russia since the first days of the Ukraine offensive -- when riot police cracked down hard on the thousands that took to the streets to protest.</p><p>All major critics of the Kremlin are in exile, prison or dead.</p><p>Those that remain have been silenced.</p><p>&quot;Many have been forced out of the country, some have been killed,&quot; said Gleb, a 23-year-old photographer.</p><p>A movement or person like Nemtsov was &quot;impossible&quot; to imagine right now, he said.</p><p>Still, he held on to a slither of hope.</p><p>&quot;But everything can change at any moment.&quot;</p><p>bur/jxb</p></div></article></div>",

neighbours at &quot;open war&quot; following months of tit-for-tat clashes.</p><p>AFP reporters in Kabul and Kandahar heard blasts and jets overhead until dawn, and the Taliban government said Pakistani surveillance&nbsp;aircraft were flying over Afghanistan on Friday afternoon.</p><p>The overnight operation was Pakistan&#39;s most widespread bombardment of the Afghan capital and its first air strikes on the southern power base of the Taliban authorities since they returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Near the key Torkham border crossing, an AFP journalist heard shelling on Friday morning, and a camp accommodating Afghans who had returned from Pakistan was hit by the fighting overnight.</p><p>&quot;Children, women, and old people were running,&quot; Gander Khan, a 65-year-old returnee, told AFP in front of rows of tents at the Omari camp.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s latest operation came after Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops on Thursday night in retaliation for earlier air strikes by Islamabad.</p><p>Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces killed 55 Pakistani soldiers and captured several others, while putting the death toll among Afghan troops at 13.</p><p>The head of the Pakistan military&#39;s publicity wing, Lieutenant General&nbsp;Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, told reporters &quot;274 Taliban regime members and terrorists&quot; had been killed, for the loss of 12 Pakistani troops.</p><p>Casualty claims from both sides are difficult to verify independently.</p><p>- Relations plunge -</p><p>Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Most of the attacks have been claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has stepped up assaults in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

repeatedly emphasised a peaceful solution, and still want the problem to be resolved through dialogue,&quot; Mujahid told a news conference, adding: &quot;Right now, Pakistani planes, reconnaissance aircraft, are flying over Afghanistan&#39;s airspace.&quot;</p><p>- Delicate ceasefire broken -</p><p>The overnight strikes mark a &quot;significant and dangerous escalation from earlier clashes&quot;, South Asia expert Michael Kugelman said on X.</p><p>&quot;Pakistan appears to have expanded its targeting beyond TTP to the Taliban regime itself,&quot; he said.</p><p>Several rounds of negotiations between Islamabad and Kabul followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.</p><p>After repeated breaches of the initial truce, Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.</p><p>Iran, which shares an eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, offered on Friday to help &quot;facilitate dialogue&quot;, while the Saudi foreign minister spoke with his Pakistani counterpart and China said it was &quot;working with&quot; both countries while calling for calm.</p><p>An AFP reporter in Kandahar, where Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada is based, also heard jets overnight and drones on Friday evening.</p><p>- Capital streets quiet -</p><p>Streets in Kabul were quiet after daybreak, in keeping with a Friday during Ramadan in the Muslim-majority nation.</p><p>At the camp for returnees near Torkham, multiple civilians were wounded in a Pakistan strike, Nangarhar provincial official Qureshi Badlun said.</p><p>One woman was killed and several others were hospitalised, according to provincial public health spokesman Naqibullah Rahimi.</p><p>Spokesman Mujahid told AFP that several Pakistani soldiers had been &quot;caught alive&quot;, a claim denied by the prime minister&#39;s office in Islamabad.</p><p>The military operation follows recent Pakistan strikes on Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, which the UN mission in Afghanistan said killed at least 13 civilians.</p><p>Besides military operations, there has been a series of deadly suicide blasts in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent months.</p><p>They included an attack on a Shiite mosque in Islamabad&nbsp;that killed at least 40 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group.</p><p>The militant group&#39;s regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a restaurant in Kabul last

provisionally apply the Mercosur trade deal (Simon Wohlfahrt)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The European Commission announced Friday it will provisionally implement a mammoth trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur, prompting a public split between its two largest member states France and Germany.</p><p>EU chief Ursula von der Leyen announced the bloc would go forward with agreement pending the EU top court&#39;s ruling on its legality after Argentina and Uruguay ratified the agreement Thursday.</p><p>&quot;The commission will now proceed with provisional application,&quot; von der Leyen said in Brussels, recalling that member states had given the EU executive power to do so.</p><p>&quot;Provisional application is, by its nature, provisional,&quot; she added, saying: &quot;The agreement can only be fully concluded once the European Parliament has given its consent.&quot;</p><p>She hailed the ratification by the two South American countries as &quot;good news&quot;.</p><p>The deal still needs a green light from lawmakers in the European Parliament, which referred it to the EU&#39;s top court within days of being inked in January.</p><p>France has led opposition to the deal and unsuccessfully attempted to block it over worries for its farmers, who fear being undercut by&nbsp;cheaper goods from Brazil and its neighbours.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision a &quot;bad surprise&quot; that ignored the European Parliament, but Germany and Spain welcomed the step.</p><p>&quot;Companies and people from both continents can finally benefit from more prosperity and growth,&quot; German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.</p><p>- EU &#39;empowered&#39; to decide -</p><p>Provisional application will begin on &quot;the first day of the second month following the date on which the EU and Uruguay (as first Mercosur country to ratify) exchange notes verbales&quot;, EU trade spokesman Olof Gill later clarified.</p><p>French agriculture minister Annie Genevard said the decision was &quot;very damaging to the functioning of our institutions and, above all, to the spirit of our European institutions&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But Gill said EU states had &quot;empowered&quot; the commission to take such a decision.</p><p>The deal will provisionally apply to the Mercosur countries that have ratified it, Gill told reporters, adding the commission anticipated remaining members Brazil and Paraguay would do so &quot;soon&quot;.</p><p>Reacting to von der Leyen&#39;s announcement, French EU lawmaker Celine Imart accused the commission of &quot;showing contempt&quot; for farmers.</p><p>&quot;We will continue to fight with determination to ensure that this provisional application never becomes permanent,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>- Agriculture worries -</p><p>The deal between the EU and the four founding members of the Mercosur bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- was a quarter century in the making.</p><p>The accord creates one of the world&#39;s biggest free trade zones and eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of trade between the two blocs, which together account for 30 percent of global GDP and over 700 million consumers.</p><p>Farmers across Europe remain unconvinced and are up in arms, including in Spain where they staged a protest against the deal in Madrid earlier this month.</p><p>The European Commission, however, insists it has fully addressed their concerns by approving a series of safeguards for its producers.</p><p>Von der Leyen stressed the deal offered &quot;countless opportunities&quot;.</p><p>She added: &quot;It allows our small and medium-sized businesses to access markets and scale they could only dream of before.&quot;</p><p>Major exports from the South American grouping to the EU include agricultural products and minerals, while the 27-country bloc would export machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals with smaller levies.</p><p>burs-ob-raz/rl</p></div></article></div>",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga</p><p>TIRANA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Social media platform TikTok is back in Albania after a year-long ban expired this month, in a case illustrating the complexity of imposing bans in a politically fragmented region ‌and sparking questions over online safety and censorship.</p><p>The ban, imposed last year and ostensibly linked to the death of a ‌teenage boy after bullying online, saw Chinese-owned short video platform TikTok banned for all users. The government says TikTok has now tightened safety measures sufficiently.</p><p>But the case is ​complex in a country hit by unrest over political corruption and where the ruling party is in an unprecedented fourth term in power. Opposition parties accuse the government of trying to silence them by banning the platform weeks before parliamentary elections last year.</p><p>The government of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama told Reuters that TikTok had taken steps to address issues that it had raised and said the ban helped put pressure on the ‌platform.</p><p>&quot;With its correct behavior toward our concerns, TikTok ⁠confirmed to us the expression that &#39;the devil is not as black as it seems&#39;,&quot; the government said in a statement, adding it had put in place &quot;important filters for security and language&quot;.</p><p>TikTok declined to comment. The ⁠government said there was &quot;no connection&quot; between the TikTok ban and election interference and that the &quot;only goal&quot; had been to protect children.</p><p>ONLINE SAFETY OR CENSORSHIP?</p><p>TikTok was suspended in Albania after a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death by a fellow pupil, a crime that local media reports said occurred after the ​two had ​clashed online. At the time TikTok said the clash did not originate ​on their platform.</p><p>It also came weeks before a crunch ‌parliamentary election.</p><p>&quot;The shutdown of TikTok was certainly a move by the Rama government to manipulate public opinion,&quot; said Edona Haklaj from the small party Shqiperia Behet that has been holding daily protests in front of Rama&#39;s office since early December. She did not give any concrete proof for her assertion.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Albania has been marred in recent months by violent protests between police and the main opposition Democratic Party, demanding the resignation of the government after deputy PM Belinda Balluku was indicted for manipulating public tenders.</p><p>Late on Thursday Rama, in power since 2013, fired Balluku, though ‌the opposition has pledged to still hold protests on Saturday. Activists worry ​the TikTok ban - even if lifted - could be used to justify further blocks amid ​rising tensions.</p><p>&quot;This will create a dangerous precedent,&quot; said Isa Myzyraj, ​the president of the Association of the Albanian Journalists. &quot;Any government could exploit this precedent to block other social ‌networks or even impose a total internet shutdown.&quot;</p><p>Brenton Benja, ​founder of Geek Room Albania who ​tracked the ban, cautioned that the measure had had limited impact as people used VPNs to skirt controls - a signal of the wider challenge of imposing social media bans on increasingly tech-savvy users.</p><p>The government also acknowledged in its statement that a full ​ban had proved &quot;impossible&quot; because of technological hurdles.</p><p>&quot;The 1.7 ‌million Albanians we knew were using TikTok at the time it was closed continued to use it throughout the ​year by turning to alternative methods such as VPNs,&quot; Benja said.</p><p>(Reporting by Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga; Additional reporting ​by Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by Ivana Sekularac, Adam Jourdan and Hugh Lawson)</p></div></article></div>",

surely it is the floor for every soldier”.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In response, Senior Minister of State for Defence Zaqy Mohamad said there is a fundamental difference between salaries and NS allowances, and an equivalence should not be drawn between the two.</p><p>A salary is compensation for work done, while NS is a unique civic duty and contribution by all able-bodied Singaporean males and not a transaction, he added.</p><p>“While we acknowledge that serving NS involves opportunity cost, we should not erode our social compact and the ethos of service by casting it as an employer-employee relationship,” he added.</p><p>SMS Zaqy said Mindef regularly reviews allowances and incentives for servicemen, with reviews in 2015, 2020, 2023, and in July 2025.</p><p>The 2023 review saw NS allowance increased by between $125 and $200, depending on rank and vocation. The 2025 review saw allowances raised from between $35 to $75.</p><p>Over the past decade, the allowance for a recruit in basic military training has risen by 65 per cent, said SMS Zaqy. Recruits currently get $790 a month in allowance, while a Lieutenant receives $1,530.</p><p>During national service, the state also takes care of the vast majority of NSFs’ basic needs, such as accommodation and food, and allowances are designed to support their personal upkeep and incidentals, he added.</p><p>Mr Tiong said he disagreed with SMS Zaqy’s framing that accommodation, food, and equipping are part of the compensation package for NSFs.</p><p>“The fact is that people who have no choice get paid less than people who do...Why can’t we find it (in us) to pay our soldiers fairly?” he asked.</p><p>In response, Mr Chan said he had never seen Singaporeans think of NS as a transaction, and that he hoped that generations of Singaporeans will continue to not view NS this way.</p><p>“It is not in our interest to cause invidious comparisons, or to bring down the sacred duty of serving our country into a transaction,” he said.</p><p>“Of course we will take care of our NSmen, of course we will regularly review our NSF allowances (and) do more for NS HOME awards,” added Mr Chan.</p><p>“You can have my assurance we will take care of our NSmen, but I appeal to Members of this House not to conflate duty with transaction.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mindef-cares-for-soldiers-beyond-allowance-ns-is-not-a-transaction-chan-chun-sing?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

to reach a deal.</p><p>The talks follow repeated threats from President Donald Trump to strike Iran while the US military builds up its forces in the region.</p><p>As the world&#39;s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, was due to arrive off the coast of key US-ally Israel, the US embassy in the country announced it was allowing non-emergency government personnel and family members to leave &quot;due to safety risks&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,&quot; the embassy said on its website.</p><p>The New York Times reported that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee sent an email to embassy staff on Friday morning saying that those wishing to leave &quot;should do so TODAY&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Focus on getting a seat to anyplace from which you can then continue travel to DC, but the first priority will be getting expeditiously out of country,&quot; he was quoted as writing.</p><p>Growing concerns over conflict spurred China on Friday to join other countries in warning its citizens to leave Iran &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</p><p>Trump on February 19 gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal. While Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on nuclear issues, the United States wants Tehran&#39;s missile programme and its support for militant groups curtailed.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump&#39;s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States.</p><p>Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that &quot;success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>-&nbsp;Talks to continue -</p><p>Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations &quot;made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field&quot;.</p><p>He said the next round would take place in &quot;perhaps less than a week&quot;, with technical talks at the UN&#39;s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday</p><p>Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna.</p><p>&quot;We have finished the day after significant progress,&quot; he&nbsp;said in a post on X.</p><p>UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP.</p><p>Trump said in his State of the Union address this week that Iran had &quot;already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they&#39;re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America&quot;.</p><p>He also accused Iran of &quot;pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions&quot;, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.</p><p>The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims &quot;big lies&quot;.</p><p>- &#39;Extremely alarmed&#39; -</p><p>Washington already had more than a dozen warships in the Middle East, including another aircraft carrier, before deploying the Gerald R. Ford.</p><p>A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>The UN rights chief Volker Turk said he was &quot;extremely alarmed&quot; at the risk of a regional escalation around Iran, adding: &quot;I hope the voice of reason prevails&quot;.</p><p>Turk also highlighted Iran&#39;s domestic pressures, after Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests last month, killing thousands of people according to rights groups.</p><p>&quot;The situation in Iran remains volatile,&quot; Turk told the Human Rights Council in Geneva, noting that protests have since resumed around Iranian universities, &quot;making it clear that the underlying grievances remain&quot;.</p><p>burs-sw/dl</p></div></article></div>",
