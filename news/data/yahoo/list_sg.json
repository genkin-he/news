any wrongdoing (HANDOUT)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former US president Bill Clinton denied wrongdoing at a Congressional panel Friday on his well-documented links to Jeffrey Epstein, as Democrats seek to shift focus toward Donald Trump&#39;s own ties to the convicted sex offender.</p><p>Clinton features prominently throughout the Epstein files, but he insists that he broke ties well before the disgraced billionaire&#39;s 2008 conviction for sex offenses.</p><p>&quot;I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,&quot; Clinton said in his opening statement, shared on social media.</p><p>The Republican chair of the House committee probing Epstein, James Comer, said ahead of Bill Clinton&#39;s deposition he looked forward to &quot;asking lots of questions.&quot;</p><p>But Democrats on the committee reiterated their call for Trump to be quizzed.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be real, we are talking to the wrong president,&quot; said Democrat committee member Suhas&nbsp;Subramanyam.</p><p>Clinton did not name Trump directly but said &quot;no person is above the law, even presidents -- especially presidents.&quot;</p><p>Being mentioned in the files released by the US Department of Justice does not imply wrongdoing, and Clinton has not been accused of a crime or formally investigated.</p><p>He follows his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who testified Thursday, defiantly calling for President Trump -- who like Bill Clinton had many ties with Epstein -- to appear before the panel.</p><p>The lawmakers should ask Trump &quot;directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,&quot; she said.</p><p>The depositions are being held behind closed doors, with Bill Clinton likening the proceedings to a &quot;kangaroo court.&quot; The couple has called for them to be open and televised.</p><p>The grilling comes with greater peril for the former president than for his wife, as he has acknowledged extensive interactions with Epstein but said he never visited the financier&#39;s private Caribbean island.</p><p>Epstein mingled with the world&#39;s rich, famous and powerful, and was convicted in 2008 for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee is probing those who were linked to Epstein in light of the Justice Department&#39;s disclosures of millions of new documents related to its investigation of him.</p><p>The Clintons had initially rejected subpoenas ordering them to testify, but the Democratic power couple agreed to do so after House Republicans threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress.</p><p>- Newly released pictures -</p><p>Hillary Clinton said in her opening statement to the panel that it &quot;justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me be as clear as I can. I do not.&quot;</p><p>Democrats say the investigation is being weaponized to attack Trump&#39;s political opponents rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.</p><p>Previously unseen photographs from the files include one showing Bill Clinton reclining in a hot tub, part of the image obscured by a stark black rectangle.</p><p>In another, Clinton is pictured swimming alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein&#39;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein&#39;s private plane several times in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, while Hillary said she did not know Epstein.</p><p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein was in the White House 17 times while Bill Clinton was President. We know that Bill Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane at least 27 times. So those are questions that we&#39;re going to ask,&quot; said Comer.</p><p>Clinton said in his opening statement &quot;not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing -- I would have turned him in.&quot;</p><p>The depositions are being held in Chappaqua, New York, where the Clintons reside.</p><p>Dozens of journalists have converged on the wealthy hamlet and the Secret Service erected metal barricades around the arts center where the depositions are happening.</p><p>pel-gw/bgs</p></div></article></div>",

Six years into the remission the surgery provided her, the cancer came roaring back.</p><p>Kim and her husband left their boys with me and traveled to Texas to meet with doctors at one of the top cancer hospitals in the world. They were supposed to be there for an entire week, but they were back the next morning. Just minutes into her first appointment, she was told to go home. There wasn’t any research being done on her type of incredibly rare cancer since it would only benefit a handful of people.</p><p>I believe that moment was one of the turning points in her health. Hope is a powerful thing ... and so is stealing it from someone.</p><p>With no treatments available for her specific condition, Kim’s doctors selected a few options from existing chemotherapies — all created for and used on other types of cancer — to administer to Kim. They hoped one of them would miraculously stop the growth of the tumors that were now inside of her bones.</p><p>They didn’t work. All they did was make her grow weaker.</p><p>The sound of the morphine pump set to deliver a dose of the opioid to Kim every 15 minutes brought my attention back to the room. Given the steady stream of painkillers she was receiving and her own increasing mental cloudiness, I was amazed my sister had been able to figure out what I was alluding to by mentioning that it was Feb. 29.</p><p>The day before, Kim had inexplicably gotten out of bed and started to pack her suitcase, stating that her pain was gone, so now she could go home. Explaining to her that she couldn’t leave — and why she couldn’t — was the hardest conversation I’ve ever had in my entire life. I’ll never forget the look on her face the moment she remembered why we were there.</p><p>“Oh right, I’m here to die,” she said quietly and stopped packing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 579px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:92%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author (right) and her sister Kathleen (left) take one of their final walks with their sister Kim (center) around the halls of the hospice center days before Kim passed away.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BaAYeGjglMzoVR2MgEw9_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMTQx/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/99f92c6125e30e3d160209fc976a83b3><noscript><img alt=\"The author (right) and her sister Kathleen (left) take one of their final walks with their sister Kim (center) around the halls of the hospice center days before Kim passed away.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BaAYeGjglMzoVR2MgEw9_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMTQx/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/99f92c6125e30e3d160209fc976a83b3 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author (right) and her sister Kathleen (left) take one of their final walks with their sister Kim (center) around the halls of the hospice center days before Kim passed away. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Kristyn Benedyk</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><em>Like this article?

I took one of the tiny sponges-on-a-stick out of the cup of water on the bedside table and dampened her lips. They were starting to crack despite my — and Kathleen’s and Kim’s husband’s and my parents’ — efforts to delay the inevitable discomforts that accompany the onset of death.</p><p>She rubbed her lips back and forth over the thin layer of ice water I had applied. Then she closed her eyes and took a long but shallow breath.</p><p>I leaned back in my chair. Kim’s moments of awareness were growing increasingly short and infrequent, and I didn’t know when she would be awake again. I felt both defeated and ashamed for even suggesting what I had suggested.</p><p>I was also frustrated that we were still there. Kim’s doctors had told us that once she made the decision to stop getting blood transfusions, it would only be two or three days before she passed.</p><p>Not only did the chemotherapies chosen by Kim’s doctors fail to stop the cancer from growing, one of them had triggered her body to relentlessly attack its own blood cells.</p><p>Her medical team attempted numerous procedures to reverse this — including hooking her up to a machine that looked and sounded like a prop from a 1940s movie set in a mad scientist’s lab that removed and replaced all the blood in her body —&nbsp;but nothing worked, and eventually Kim needed daily blood transfusions to stay alive.</p><p>It was at this point that my family learned that <a href=\"https://donatingblood.org/for-donors/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:one-fourth of the blood supply in the United States is used by patients battling cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">one-fourth of the blood supply in the United States is used by patients battling cancer</a>.&nbsp;Cancer patients rely on these blood donations to stay strong enough to continue their treatments. I remember finding it odd that this fact wasn’t common knowledge.</p><p>Somewhere around Kim’s 40th blood transfusion, she told the doctors, “Don’t worry, we’ll pay you back.” They thought she was joking, but she wasn’t.</p><p>We planned a blood drive. Kim was looking forward to being there and making good on her promise to her doctors.</p><p>But while the daily blood transfusions were keeping Kim alive, they weren’t eliminating her exhaustion or easing her pain. And her body had reached a point where it couldn’t tolerate any more attempts at treatment.</p><p>So, Kim made the devastating, but understandable, decision to discontinue them.</p><p>All that was left to do was to make Kim as comfortable and pain-free as possible as she entered hospice.</p><p>Disappointed that she was no longer going to be able to attend the blood drive, Kim requested that we ask people to attend the event and donate blood instead of us holding a wake or funeral for her.</p><p>A week before the event, over 300 people had already signed up to donate blood. My family and I were juggling taking care of Kim with doing newspaper and TV interviews about the drive. Kim had officially started a movement.</p><p>We named it <a href=\"http://www.apintforkim.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:A Pint For Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">A Pint For Kim</a>. My humble sister immediately objected and demanded her name be removed. We vetoed her request.</p><p>While refusing someone’s dying wish might not seem like a nice thing to do, we all knew the only reason hundreds of people were signing up was because of Kim — because of how she treated people and approached life.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 421px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"After setting the Illinois state record with their first blood drive, A Pint For Kim moved to a private airplane hanger in its second year to be able to accommodate over 500 blood donors.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vf6BXHf5YLhw.Gbob0SiWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04MzA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/a70cb2eb9c943fad17f41d70d46f2e3a><noscript><img alt=\"After setting the Illinois state record with their first blood drive, A Pint For Kim moved to a private airplane hanger in its second year to be able to accommodate over 500 blood donors.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vf6BXHf5YLhw.Gbob0SiWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04MzA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/a70cb2eb9c943fad17f41d70d46f2e3a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>After setting the Illinois state record with their first blood drive, A Pint For Kim moved to a private airplane hanger in its second year to be able to accommodate over 500 blood donors. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Kristyn Benedyk</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>During her eight-year battle, none of us had ever heard Kim complain, express anger, or even ask, “Why me?” Not once.</p><p>After Kim passed, the first thing I found when cleaning out her nightstand was a journal. Written on the first page in her handwriting were two sentences: <em>We are not here for ourselves. We are here to love and serve others.</em></p><p>Kim’s inability to ever feel mad about her situation amazed me, especially because I found myself feeling furious so often at the end of Kim’s life. The two or three days the doctors told us it would take for her to die had come and gone, and Kim was still taking strolls around the hospice center with her walker, asking us to pick up her favorite fast food, and, at one point, suggesting that I flirt with a group of former college baseball players who were there to visit their teammate in the room next to ours.</p><p>Kim did not seem like someone who was about to die. The whole situation seemed like a cruel and heart-wrenching prank that was becoming increasingly impossible to bear.</p><p>Looking for answers, we asked a doctor at the hospice center why it was taking so long. He explained to us that aside from the handful of tumors in her bones and the irreversible attack on her own blood cells, she was an otherwise healthy 49-year-old woman. The rest of her was strong. Strong mind. Strong lungs. A strong — and deeply loving — heart.</p><p>He apologized for the misinformation we had initially been given. In retrospect, I’m not sure if knowing that it would take much longer than we had expected would have made the whole process easier or harder.</p><p>What I do know is that watching the person you are closer to than anyone else in the world unhurriedly die over a period of close to two weeks is indescribably and devastatingly heartbreaking. So, perhaps some part of me wanted Kim to die that Feb. 29 because I couldn’t take any more of the excruciating pain of witnessing her slowly leave us.</p><p>I looked over at Kim. She was wearing a shirt that said NOPE, and I smiled at how strong-willed she was even as the end approached. </p><p>She took another long inhale. This time, instead of exhaling, she spoke.</p><p>“OK.”</p><p>“OK what?” I asked.</p><p>“OK,” she said, her eyes still closed. “I’ll try to die today.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 941px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:149%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author donates blood in her sister&#x002019;s memory as part of their A Pint For Kim movement.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fGWbcUpnnUIrUseF3B8vSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xODU1/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/050a9747f645b2c00b044b65cd1a92e6><noscript><img alt=\"The author donates blood in her sister&#x002019;s memory as part of their A Pint For Kim movement.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fGWbcUpnnUIrUseF3B8vSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xODU1/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/050a9747f645b2c00b044b65cd1a92e6 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author donates blood in her sister’s memory as part of their A Pint For Kim movement. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Kristyn Benedyk</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><span>Every muscle in my chest tightened, making it suddenly impossible to breathe. Somehow I had been able to remain strong for her for the week we’d already spent in hospice, the months I had just spent by her side at the hospital, and the last eight years of watching her fight this battle with complete grace.</span></p><p><span>But now, hearing these six soft-spoken words completely broke me.</span></p><p><span>I was determined not to let Kim hear me trying not to cry, so I pressed my hand over my mouth and nose and held it there firmly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By the time I pulled myself together, Kim was asleep again.

There, we had watched other families rotate in and out of the hospice center while we waited for the agonizingly long process of dying to come to an end for Kim.</span></p><p><span>I found Kathleen.

We were diligent about making sure she was never alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kathleen took a seat beside Kim’s bed. I quickly changed into my pajamas and washed up for bed. When I returned to the room, we sat in silence as we watched Kim sleep — something we had gotten used to doing over the last four months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I checked my phone occasionally, and when I saw it was 11:57 p.m., I didn’t take my eyes off of it until I saw it was midnight. I softly cleared my throat to get Kathleen’s attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I held up my phone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“March 1,” I whispered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We shared a look of subtle disappointment.

Ted Cruz prepared to board the same flight from Houston to Washington in recent months, the two famously brash Republicans had a tense exchange that now looms large over Crenshaw’s battle for political survival.</p><p>Crenshaw accused Cruz of working against him in his House primary. According to three people with direct knowledge of their interaction, Cruz responded: “If I’m working against you, you’re gonna know it.”</p><p>This week, Cruz made it known.</p><p>The junior Texas senator endorsed Steve Toth, a Texas state representative and a former megachurch pastor who is facing Crenshaw in Tuesday’s Republican primary. And he taped an ad that a pro-Toth super PAC is now airing in the Houston area.</p><p>“You deserve an unwavering fighter, a Republican who walks the walk,” Cruz says in <a href=\"https://adm0.page.link/aBNj\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the ad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the ad</a>, which doesn’t mention Crenshaw.</p><p>Crenshaw, the Navy SEAL who has rocketed to national fame for his confrontational style, has spent years fighting with “Make America Great Again” allies who see him as insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump. Now, days before his primary, Crenshaw’s previously unreported feud with Cruz reflects how the congressman is facing major enemies in his already tough reelection bid.</p><p>Trump is not expected to endorse Crenshaw, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Crenshaw is the only House Republican from Texas not to get the president’s backing.</p><p>“He told me he would — it’s up to him, he doesn’t owe me anything,” Crenshaw told CNN.</p><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, too, endorsed 27 House Republicans for Congress this cycle without backing Crenshaw. And now Cruz is backing Toth.</p><p>The nasty primary between Crenshaw and Toth has mostly been out of the public eye. But it’s been increasingly ringing alarm bells in Washington as GOP leaders now believe Crenshaw could lose or at least be forced into a May 26 runoff.</p><p>Crenshaw has succeeded in close primary fights before. But those were against poorly funded opponents who still came close to unseating him. (His opponent in 2024 raised <a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/houston/conroe-montgomery/election/2024/03/05/update-crenshaw-wins-republican-primary-for-texas-2nd-congressional-district/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:less than $30,000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">less than $30,000 </a>but won 40% of the vote.)</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In an interview, Crenshaw predicted he would win reelection in the Houston suburbs seat, telling CNN: “I see myself winning.”</p><h3>Inside Crenshaw’s feud with Cruz</h3><p>Crenshaw’s allies note that Cruz had initially endorsed his opponent in 2018. But over the years, tensions rose between the two Republicans – partly, according to multiple Texas GOP sources, as some Cruz allies feared that Crenshaw was preparing a primary bid against the senator in 2024.</p><p>Crenshaw denied such ambitions in a fiery call with Cruz in 2021, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Cruz began the call by thanking Crenshaw for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=XUP30p_mUV8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:defending him publicly;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">defending him publicly</a> shortly after the January 6 violence at the Capitol, when Cruz was facing national backlash for fundraising off the riot, those people told CNN.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Sen.

Steve Toth in in Spring, Texas, in January 2022. - Michael Wyke/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><h3>Why Crenshaw’s opponent sees opportunity</h3><p>Toth is no stranger to competing against established incumbents; he challenged former Rep. Kevin Brady in 2016 for Texas’ 8th District.</p><p>This time around, he has questioned Crenshaw’s loyalty to Trump over the 2020 presidential election and support for Ukraine aid.</p><p>There’s another factor that has Toth and his allies even more confident they can win: Crenshaw is running in a newly drawn seat that includes thousands of new voters. And they argue that Toth, who’s represented much of the area in the Texas statehouse since 2019, will feel more like the incumbent to some in the district.</p><p>Crenshaw insists that voters will back him over Toth, who’s considered one of the most conservative Republicans in the legislature.</p><p>“I’m going up against a guy who’s got the worst possible voting record and we’ve just got to get that information out to people,” Crenshaw told CNN. “We’ve got a very strong history of work. He’s got a very strong history of passing zero bills in the Texas legislature.”</p><p>In response to Crenshaw’s remarks, Nick Maddux, a consultant for Toth’s campaign, criticized the congressman for voting against his own constituents’ interests and reacting to “any ounce of criticism with hubristic rage and anger.”</p><p>“After alienating not only his voters, almost the entire Texas delegation and all of Congress along the way, it’s no surprise that he finds himself with few friends helping him down the stretch,” Maddux told CNN on Thursday.</p><h3>What a Crenshaw loss would mean to Republicans – and to him</h3><p>If Crenshaw loses on Tuesday or in an eventual runoff, he would be the first Texas House incumbent to go down in a primary since 2014.</p><p>A loss would be the latest warning sign for congressional Republicans seen as out of line with MAGA. Longtime Sen. John Cornyn, running for reelection and facing similar questions about his loyalty to Trump, is in the toughest test of his career from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Rep. Wesley Hunt.</p><p>“Crenshaw’s kinda got a Cornyn problem, in that he wasn’t a devout Trumpy the whole time. And now he’s paying for it,” Reb Wayne, a longtime Texas GOP strategist who is neutral in the race, told CNN.</p><p>One person close to Crenshaw put it another way: “He admits he doesn’t just tell people what they want to hear.”</p><p>While Crenshaw’s voting record is firmly pro-White House, Republicans in Texas and Washington say he has been increasingly alienating himself from the party. People close to Crenshaw insist he has maintained a cordial relationship with the president but acknowledge he’s detested by plenty of Trump’s closest advisers.</p><p>“There were some votes that he cast incorrectly in the eyes of a lot of conservatives. The other thing that’s hurt him is he’s one of these politicians that just can’t stay off Twitter,” Wayne added.</p><p>That animosity stems from Crenshaw’s positions like his support for Ukraine, his vote to certify the 2020 election and his support for resettling Afghan allies in the US. But it’s also some of his personal conduct, like his bitter feud with Tucker Carlson or his<a href=\"https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1468201562019352576\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:veiled attacks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> veiled attacks </a>calling Congress’s MAGA hardliners “grifters.” (Then there are the allegations of public drunkenness while on a work trip to Mexico City, which Crenshaw has denied.)</p><p>Crenshaw’s allies say he simply doesn’t care to pander for endorsements and would rather win a race on his merits. They say he’s always disdained politics and that he achieved his sole mission in life by becoming a Navy SEAL. He received a Purple Heart after losing his right eye in Afghanistan.</p><p>“He is not someone who just follows the party talking points and he has prided himself on telling the truth, including to Republican base voters, and sometimes they don’t like that,” another person familiar with Crenshaw’s thinking told CNN.</p><p>CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

that civilians must be protected and healthcare access guaranteed.</p><p>Pakistan bombed major cities in Afghanistan including the capital Kabul on Friday, with Islamabad&#39;s defence minister declaring the neighbours at &quot;open war&quot; following months of tit-for-tat clashes.</p><p>&quot;We are witnessing a profound escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&quot; ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement, calling for &quot;restraint and de-escalation&quot;.</p><p>She highlighted that the upsurge in violence was harming people in a region that had &quot;already endured decades of conflict, displacement and loss&quot;.</p><p>&quot;They have seen and felt the impact of war on their loved ones in their communities,&quot; she said.</p><p>Pakistan&#39;s latest operation came after Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops on Thursday night in retaliation for earlier air strikes by Islamabad.</p><p>Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.</p><p>Spoljaric stressed that under international law, &quot;civilians, the wounded and others not -- or no longer -- taking part in the fighting must be protected&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Humanitarian assistance must reach all those affected (and) hospitals must be able to operate and access to essential services must be guaranteed,&quot; she added.</p><p>&quot;These are not privileges,&quot; insisted the head of the ICRC, which is the caretaker of the Geneva Conventions.</p><p>&quot;They are obligations under international humanitarian law.&quot;</p><p>Spoljaric said her organisation was &quot;preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground&quot;, in cooperation with the Afghan and Pakistan Red Crescent societies and state authorities.</p><p>&quot;The focus on both sides of the border now is to support health facilities treating people who were wounded by hostilities,&quot; she said.</p><p>She stressed however that &quot;no humanitarian response can compensate for political will to respect the rules of war and prioritise de-escalation&quot;.</p><p>nl/rjm/sbk</p></div></article></div>",

to re-arm against an aggressive Russia and as Washington turns away.</p><p>The speech by Macron, at France&#39;s Ile Longue nuclear submarine base, will be closely watched across Europe, which for decades has relied on the United States&#39; nuclear deterrent but is now increasingly debating whether to bolster its own arsenals.</p><p>He is expected to update France&#39;s nuclear doctrine, with a member of his team telling AFP to expect &quot;fairly significant shifts and developments&quot; but declining to give any further details.</p><p>Macron has previously proposed to consider how France -- the European Union&#39;s only nuclear power -- could contribute to protecting Europe.</p><p>He said this month he is considering a doctrine that could include &quot;special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries&quot;.</p><p>Last year, Macron said he was ready to discuss possible deployment of French aircraft armed with nuclear weapons in

Galeote, however, believes regulation and freedom ​of expression can coexist.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s impossible to think that ​a man on the street ​could shout that they&#39;ll rape you and nothing happens, but ‌that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing online,&quot; she said.</p><p>Instead ​of imposing easily ​absorbable fines, Galeote advocated barring platforms from major markets, like the European Union, for repeated violations.</p><p>While defending pseudonymous online use, Galeote emphasized the need ​for traceable identities behind all ‌accounts.</p><p>&quot;Call yourself &#39;PeppaPig88&#39; if you want - fine. But there has to be ​a real identity behind that account,&quot; she said.</p><p>(Reporting by David Latona; ​Editing by Aislinn Laing and Andrei Khalip)</p></div></article></div>",
