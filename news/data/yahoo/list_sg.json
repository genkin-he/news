leader Ali Khamenei, a pillar of its theocratic system since the Islamic revolution whose death was announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, saw off multiple crises over the decades, remaining defiant to the very end.</p><p>There has been no confirmation from Tehran of his death, but Trump posted on his Truth Social site that &quot;Khamenei, one of the most evil people in history, is dead&quot; after the United States and Israel launched a massive wave of strikes targeting sites across Iran, including the supreme leader&#39;s Tehran compound.</p><p>Aged 86, Khamenei dominated Iran for the last three-and-a-half decades since taking on the post for life in 1989 as leader of the Islamic republic following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.</p><p>He also survived the 2022-2023 &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.</p><p>Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the 12-day war against Israel in June, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.</p><p>But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.</p><p>- Tight security -</p><p>Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live.</p><p>As supreme leader he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There had long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People&#39;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.</p><p>- &#39;I am opposed&#39; -</p><p>Repeatedly arrested under the shah for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei shortly after the Islamic revolution became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war.</p><p>He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.</p><p>During the 1980s, Khomeini&#39;s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.</p><p>When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic&#39;s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts met, it was Khamenei whom they chose as leader.</p><p>Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, &quot;I am opposed&quot;.&nbsp;But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power never slackened.</p><p>Khamenei worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures such as Mohammad Khatami who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.</p><p>But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners.</p><p>He was believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, had public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.</p><p>A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><p>Some of their children, including a nephew who is now in France, became vehement critics.</p><p>sjw/dcp/smw/amj</p></div></article></div>",

US launched a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-02-28-26-hnk-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:major

government without their expressed approval.</p><p>Trump ordered the strikes on Tehran just days before the GOP-led House and Senate are each set to formally debate and vote on US military action in Iran. Democrats, along with at least three Republicans, say the president’s decision, with lawmakers scattered across the nation and not planning to return to Washington for days, raises serious questions about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/28/politics/legal-experts-iran-strikes-congress-war-powers?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:legality of the attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">legality of the attack</a>.</p><p>“It’s a slap in the face of the United States Congress. The president has launched an illegal war when there is no imminent threat. He did not consult with Congress or allow for a debate in Congress, which even George W. Bush did,” Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CNN on Saturday morning.</p><p>Now, House and Senate Democratic leaders — as well as the famously anti-interventionist Republican Rep. Thomas Massie — are demanding that GOP leaders bring Congress back into session immediately to hold a formal vote on the unfolding conflict in Iran.</p><p>“I am opposed to this War. This is not ‘America First,’” said Massie of Kentucky.</p><p>“The Constitution conferred the power to declare or initiate war to Congress for a reason, to make war less likely,” Sen. Rand Paul, a leading Republican in the Senate effort to curb Trump’s war authority, similarly declared, adding that his “oath of office is to the Constitution, so with studied care, I must oppose another Presidential war.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Rep.

Those Republicans will be forced to take a public stance after months of simmering consternation over Trump’s legal authority as he has dramatically expanded powers abroad with Congress on the sidelines.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Multiple GOP sources told CNN they believe those three Republicans — Massie, Paul and Rep. Warren Davidson, who has also publicly condemned the attack without authorization — are likely on an island in their own party. Even so, Democrats believe it might be enough to deliver the rebukes.</p><p>“I do think this has a real chance of passing. And it’s going to be seen like the Iraq war vote,” Khanna added, referring to the historic 2002 vote in Congress that authorized the US invasion of Iraq.</p><p>Even if the measure passes, it is subject to a presidential veto, and a two-thirds vote to override could be a challenge to reach. So while it would be unlikely to change the president’s actions, it would be seen as a stunning rebuke of the administration.</p><p>One Republican, speaking to the CNN on the condition of anonymity because they had received classified briefings on the operation, fiercely disputed that Trump was leading the nation into another conflict akin to the Iraq War. The person believed there was wide support in the party for the president’s actions.</p><p>Indeed, dozens of Republicans were quick to praise Trump’s actions on Saturday morning, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. But there have been signs of cracks in the GOP in recent days amid rumblings of an Iran assault.</p><p>One ultraconservative Republican, Davidson of Ohio, already telegraphed that he planned to support the Democratic-led bill that would have formally ordered Trump to make the case to Congress for any military actions in Iran, in a major affront to the White House.</p><p>“No. War requires Congressional authorization,” Davidson, a former Army Ranger who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, <a href=\"https://x.com/WarrenDavidson/status/2027767769014341920?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:said Saturday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">said Saturday</a>, unequivocally stating he did not support the president’s action in Iran.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Rep.

The full Congress has not received a briefing related to Iran, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe did deliver a classified update to the “Gang of Eight” earlier this week.</p><p>And while Rubio notified all reachable members of the Gang of Eight congressional leaders in advance of the overnight strikes, those top lawmakers were not given a full accounting of the legal justification, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.</p><p>As they publicly condemned Trump on Saturday for having overstepped his authority, Democratic leaders had already been quietly working with Massie to convince lawmakers to deliver an official rebuke to the White House.</p><p>But as with previous attempts to constrain the Trump administration from Capitol Hill, the minority party faced significant headwinds. At least three pro-Israel Democrats were opposed to such a measure, according to multiple people familiar with the plans.</p><p>It remained unclear whether those Democrats would now approach the vote differently, two people said. House Democrats will hold a caucus call on Sunday evening to discuss the party’s response to the attack, another Democratic source said.</p><p>Even Republicans who support Trump’s push for regime change have said Congress needs to have more input — and particularly more briefings.</p><p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, said Trump “rightfully determined that this theocratic dictatorship cannot be allowed.” But he was also clear that he expected the White House to be forthcoming about the operation’s details.</p><p>“I expect all members of Congress will soon be briefed about Operation Epic Fury and determine whether a broader scope and further military action requires an authorization by Congress,” Tillis said.</p><p>Just ahead of the attack, another retiring centrist, GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, told CNN he was eager for more talks with the White House.</p><p>“I’d like to have a dialogue. The president, early on, talked about regime change. Now he’s focusing on nuclear. I don’t think you’re ever going to get a nuclear-safe environment with this regime. So in the end, this regime cannot stand. It killed about 2,000 Americans so I don’t have any concerns with that,” Bacon, who spent nearly 30 years in the Air Force, said earlier this week.</p><p>“We don’t want boots on the ground, but we should bomb the crap out of them,” he added.</p><p>CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Alayna Treene and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

sparking swift retaliation by the Islamic republic which responded with missile attacks across the region.</p><p>Here are the latest developments as the military action announced by US President Donald Trump and the Israeli government sparked a flurry of salvos from Iran that closed airspaces around the Middle East.</p><p>- Strikes across Iran -</p><p>The joint operation began with smoke rising over Tehran after strikes that Israel said were pre-emptive.</p><p>Shortly after, Trump announced US combat operations against Iran, with the goal of &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot;.</p><p>Israel&#39;s military said it targeted multiple sites where senior Iranian officials had gathered in Tehran, and launched strikes against Iran&#39;s missile launchers.</p><p>It said 200 fighter jets had taken part in the &quot;extensive attack&quot; on Iran, hitting more than 500 targets.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there were many signs Iran&#39;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had been killed.</p><p>And Trump, asked by NBC News about a report of Khamenei&#39;s demise, told the broadcaster: &quot;We feel that that is a correct story.&quot;</p><p>Two Israeli TV networks reported a photo of Khamenei&#39;s body had been shown to Trump and Netanyahu.</p><p>Israel&#39;s Channel 12 network reported that &quot;30 bombs were dropped on&quot; Khamenei&#39;s compound.</p><p>Witnesses said they heard cheers on Tehran&#39;s streets after reports of Khamenei&#39;s death.</p><p>In an NBC News interview, Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had earlier said Khamenei was alive, along with all high-ranking officials.</p><p>Netanyahu said the attacks killed senior Iranian officials and warned that thousands more targets would be struck in the coming days.</p><p>The Iranian judiciary&#39;s Mizan Online website said 108 people died in a strike on a girls school in Minab, citing a provincial official who blamed Israel.</p><p>- Missile, drone wave -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

wave of missile and drone attacks at Israel.</p><p>Israel&#39;s Magen David Adom emergency service said it was treating a man with blast injuries in the north of the country, after missiles were launched from Iran.</p><p>The Israeli military said it deployed search and rescue teams to multiple locations across the country following reports of fallen projectiles.</p><p>Iran&#39;s top security official Ali Larijani vowed to &quot;teach an unforgettable lesson&quot; to the United States and Israel.</p><p>- Gulf explosions, strait closed -</p><p>Explosions were reported across the Gulf region.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates said it intercepted a second wave of Iranian strikes, after a first killed one civilian in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Witnesses in Dubai said they heard an explosion and saw missiles streak across the sky, and witnesses told AFP they heard an explosion and saw smoke rising from the man-made island The Palm. Four people were injured.</p><p>AFP correspondents in the Saudi capital Riyadh heard loud explosions, as well as in Bahraini capital Manama and across Qatar&#39;s Doha.</p><p>Qatar&#39;s defence ministry said it had intercepted several missile attacks targeting the Gulf state.</p><p>A drone struck Kuwait&#39;s international airport and a base housing US personnel was targeted. Three Kuwaiti soldiers and 12 other people were wounded, authorities said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia condemned Iranian attacks targeting its neighbours, but made no mention of attacks on the kingdom.</p><p>Jordan said it had intercepted 13 ballistic missiles.</p><p>Explosions were also heard near the US consulate in Iraq&#39;s Erbil, according to AFP journalists.</p><p>Two people were killed in air strikes on an Iraqi military base housing the powerful pro-Iran group Kataeb Hezbollah, which threatened the US with a response.</p><p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards also moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway through which much of the world&#39;s oil and gas passes.</p><p>The Guards warned several ships the strait was &quot;basically closed&quot;, the Tasnim news agency reported, with the EU&#39;s naval mission to the Red Sea confirming that vessels had received radio messages despite no formal closure order.</p><p>- Allied support, warnings -</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron called for an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting over the escalation.</p><p>Oman&#39;s foreign minister, who has been mediating talks between Tehran and Washington, said he was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the violence.</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Canberra supports the US action against Iran, while the UK expressed fear the military strikes could blow up into &quot;a wider regional conflict&quot;.</p><p>The European Union said developments in Iran were &quot;perilous&quot;.</p><p>Russia slammed the strikes as a &quot;dangerous adventure&quot; that could spark regional &quot;catastrophe&quot;.</p><p>Pakistan condemned the &quot;unwarranted attacks against Iran&quot;, and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas slammed the strikes on its backer.</p><p>Another Iranian ally, Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah militant group, called on countries and people in the region to stand against Israel and the US.</p><p>- Airspace closures, flights nixed -</p><p>Qatar&#39;s civil aviation authority said the Gulf state&#39;s airspace had been temporarily closed.
