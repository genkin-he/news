before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.</p><p>The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/10/28/africa/sudan-rsf-takes-el-fasher-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\"

has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”</p><p>Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.</p><p>Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s <a

Fasher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">withdrawal from El Fasher</a> earlier this week.</p><p>Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.</p><p>RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”</p><p>In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.</p><p>The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.</p><p>On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.</p><p>The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.</p><p>Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/us-determines-sudans-rsf-paramilitary-group-committed-genocide-in-countrys-civil-war?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:accused the RSF of committing genocide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">accused the RSF of committing genocide</a> against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”</p><p>Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.</p><p>Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.</p><p>Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.</p><p>One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.</p><p>The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.</p><p>Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.</p><p>Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.</p><p>Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”</p><p>Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gu2xDaWK59IQNRhYExD5yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ee63403559dab2dd172c7160c11f220b><noscript><img alt=\"Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gu2xDaWK59IQNRhYExD5yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ee63403559dab2dd172c7160c11f220b class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Displaced Sudanese who fled El Fasher arrive in the town of Tawila. - AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.</p><p>Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.</p><p>The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.</p><p>The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.</p><p>“The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.</p><p>“So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.</p><p>Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.</p><p>Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”</p><p>“(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.</p><p>Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.</p><p>“On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.</p><p>In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.</p><p>Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.</p><p>“All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.</p><p>“It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.</p><p>The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/04/20/africa/wagner-sudan-russia-libya-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Russian paramilitary group Wagner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Russian paramilitary group Wagner</a>.</p><p>The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”</p><h3>Fears for the missing men</h3><p>The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”</p><p>Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”</p><p>“Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.</p><p>Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.</p><p>“The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.</p><p>Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.</p><p>“The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QnQH52JVAtZqWIsBXpRaTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c0b70829779c04cadab65ff09282a0bc><noscript><img alt=\"Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QnQH52JVAtZqWIsBXpRaTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/c0b70829779c04cadab65ff09282a0bc class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Families who fled from El Fasher gather at a camp in Tawila. - Mohammed Jamal/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.</p><p>He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.</p><p>Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.</p><p>“(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.</p><p>The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.</p><p>As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.</p><p>Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”</p><p>“We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.</p><p>CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Avery Schmitz and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Harnik/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Trick-or-treaters made their rounds at the White House on Thursday as President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump hosted their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/video/kid-halloween-costumes-white-house-trump-vrtc?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:annual Halloween event;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">annual Halloween event</a>. For once, there was consensus in Washington … on making sure no candy bucket went empty.</p><p><strong>Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.</strong></p><h3>1️⃣ Government shutdown</h3><p>As the government shutdown reaches day 31, Congress is edging closer to the 35-day record for the longest shutdown in US history. Officials have warned that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/boston-judge-intervene-snap-payments?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:food stamp benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">food stamp benefits</a> are slated to end for millions of Americans this weekend due to the impasse. Many federal workers who are going unpaid have also told CNN they are struggling to cover basic living expenses. On Thursday, President Trump urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end the shutdown by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:eliminating the Senate filibuster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">eliminating the Senate filibuster</a> — the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation. But many Republicans are opposed to the idea, arguing that it would serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.</p><h3>2️⃣ Holiday travel</h3><p>With just weeks until what could be the busiest Thanksgiving air travel period ever, airlines are calling on Congress to reopen the government so air traffic controllers and TSA agents can receive their paychecks. Many FAA employees missed their pay this month, resulting in staffing shortages as more workers call out sick. Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Thursday that Americans <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:could face a travel “disaster” and “massive delays”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">could face a travel “disaster” and “massive delays”</a> if the shutdown extends into the holiday season. Their remarks came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, where participants discussed temporary solutions — including the recruitment of more air traffic controllers.</p><h3>3️⃣ Hurricane Melissa aftermath</h3><p>Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after Hurricane Melissa unleashed widespread destruction in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 49 people have died, Reuters reported, though officials have said that number could climb in the coming weeks. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jamaica took the heaviest battering;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Jamaica took the heaviest battering</a>: Melissa made landfall there as a Category 5 storm, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:coastal town of Black River;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">coastal town of Black River</a> on Thursday. Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><h3>4️⃣ Royal family</h3><p>Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of starting the process to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles</a> and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor. The move comes as the family attempts to distance itself from Andrew’s ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/video/src-virginia-giuffres-family-reacts?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Virginia Giuffre;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Virginia Giuffre</a>, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager. Giuffre — who the prince claims never to have met — died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.</p><h3>5️⃣ Listeria outbreak</h3><p>Two additional deaths have been reported in a listeria outbreak linked to recalled ready-to-eat pasta salads and prepared meals sold at major grocery chains, including Trader Joe’s, Sprouts Farmers Market, Kroger, and Walmart, health officials said Thursday. The recalled items have led to 25 hospitalizations, six deaths and one fetal loss. The FDA, CDC and other health agencies are investigating the multi-state outbreak, which has been connected to Listeria monocytogenes contamination in precooked pasta supplied by Nate’s Fine Foods Inc. Consumers should <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/listeria-outbreak-prepared-meals?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:check their refrigerators and freezers for these products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">check their refrigerators and freezers for these products</a> and avoid eating them, the FDA said. Nate’s Fine Foods issued an apology and said it is “fully committed to transparency and to taking every necessary step to protect the health and trust of our consumers.”</p><h3>Breakfast browse</h3><h3>Hundreds celebrate Day of the Dead in Mexico City</h3><p>Día de los Muertos celebrations <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/travel/video/day-of-the-dead-celebrated-in-mexico-city-ldndigvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:have begun in Mexico City;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">have begun in Mexico City</a>, with hundreds taking to the streets dressed as La Catrina, the iconic Mexican skeleton figure.</p><h3>The ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ hat is inspired by centuries-old fashion</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/style/video/korean-gat-fashion-kpop-demon-hunters-digvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:A traditional Korean hat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">A traditional Korean hat</a> featured in Netflix’s hit movie “KPop Demon Hunters” has become a must-have for fans.</p><h3>This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy</h3><p>Chipotle reported miserable earnings this week and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter.

Now cancer-free, she helps out at the Breast Cancer Foundation as a befriender.</figcaption></div></figure><p>SINGAPORE – Ms Jamie Ng was flourishing in her career in the fashion industry, with a degree under her belt and a stable job when she found out three years ago that she had breast cancer.</p><p>She was just 23.</p><p>When she received her medical diagnosis - stage 2 triple negative breast cancer - she felt like everything came to a pause and her life had gone off the rails.</p><p>Ms Ng said: “My mind just went blank… The doctors told me it was the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/life/beating-breast-cancer-diagnosed-at-just-23-she-started-a-vlog-to-help-other-young-patients\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:most aggressive form of breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">most aggressive form of breast cancer</a>.”</p><p>The first signs of cancer emerged on Feb 1, 2022, when Ms Ng was lying on her side and felt sharp pain every now and then near her left breast.</p><p>She began massaging the area, hoping to ease the pain, and that is when she felt a small, quail egg-sized lump.</p><p>“Before the pain, I did not know it was there at all,” she said. She was diagnosed with cancer the same month, and underwent a double mastectomy in August 2022, right about the time she turned 24.</p><p>Now 27 and cancer-free, Ms Ng has switched jobs and is a financial advisor. In her spare time, she helps out at the Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF) as a befriender to support others battling the disease.</p><p>She said: “Breast cancer can happen to anyone at any time. It don’t discriminate based on age or wait until you are financially sound.”</p><p>For her, the one niggle was in not knowing to conduct her own breast self-examinations earlier.</p><p>A new poll has found that 9 in 10 young women today are not taking active steps for their breast health. However, almost half of them associated self-exams and monitoring changes with breast health.</p><p>This is among the key findings published in a BCF report called A Study In Pink: Young Women And Breast Cancer.</p><p>The report is based on a survey of 800 women in Singapore aged between 18 and 40 and aims to better understand perceptions towards breast cancer among young women, a demographic often overlooked in breast health discussions.</p><p>BCF, a social service agency, was established in 1997 to provide support for the breast cancer community and raises awareness on the importance of early detection of the disease.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The survey, carried out as part of efforts to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, was done in partnership with The Estee Lauder Companies and Gilead Sciences.</p><p>In a joint statement on Oct 8, the three organisations highlighted three other key findings from the survey.</p><p>One, there is a gap between awareness of breast cancer and knowledge about the disease among the public. Two, cost of treatment can be a barrier to safeguarding breast health. Three, there is a willingness to talk and learn more about the disease.</p><p>The survey found that, although 70 per cent of young women knew that breast cancer can be detected early, only 22 per cent knew what to look out for.</p><p>Nearly 40 per cent admitted to lacking knowledge in the topic, and only 14 per cent knew how to perform a self-exam.</p><p>Cost of treatment was the top fear for 56 per cent of respondents, compared with 29 per cent for mastectomy, and 27 per cent for mortality. Only a third believed they had enough financial coverage for preventive care.</p><p>Affordable screening was the most popular initiative - 54 per cent of respondents asked for it.</p><p>Ninety-four per cent of respondents said they wish people are more comfortable discussing breast health, and over a third already feel ready to do so.</p><p>Forty-five per cent of respondents, however, cited uncertainty as a barrier to begin taking steps for their breast health, and want clearer guidance on what to do.</p><p>BCF general manager Jacob Soo said: “The findings remind us that awareness alone is not enough; true progress begins with health literacy, early action, and accessible support.</p><p>“Awareness is high; the know-how and confidence to act are not.&nbsp;Busy lives, a fear of ‘finding something’, and uncertainty about what’s right at their age all get in the way,” he added.</p><p>In line with these findings, BCF said it is stepping up efforts to support and engage younger women. One example is the Young Women’s Networking Initiative – a peer-support platform that connects young survivors and at-risk women in their 20s and 30s.</p><p>BCF will also introduce more tailored education programmes, and expand outreach initiatives in schools and workplaces.</p><p>On Oct 11, BCF hosted its annual flagship event, the Pink Ribbon Walk 2025 at OCBC Square in Kallang. “We want this generation, and the next, to feel informed, confident, and supported to act early for themselves, and for the women who will follow,” said Mr Soo.

It&#39;s in the best interest of United States. It&#39;s in the best interest of China,&quot; Huang said.</p><p>&quot;So I&#39;m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia&#39;s technology could be exported to China.&quot;</p><p>US-CHINA FRICTION</p><p>The extent of China&#39;s access to Nvidia&#39;s chips has been a key point of friction with the United States as the two wrestle for dominance in high-end computing power and <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:artificial intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>Washington has put export controls on sales of Nvidia&#39;s most advanced AI chips to China, seeking to limit its tech progress, particularly in applications that could help its military.</p><p>Huang has tried to persuade the Trump administration to loosen the controls, saying Chinese AI&#39;s dependence on U.S. hardware was good for America.</p><p>Nvidia has been working on a new chip for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture that will be less capable than the model sold outside the country but more powerful than the most advanced model it is currently allowed to sell there, the H20, sources have previously said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But while private Chinese companies are believed to be very interested in purchasing such a chip, the Chinese government has turned cool towards Nvidia, discouraging purchases of the H20, and is instead promoting domestic chip manufacturers such as Huawei.</p><p>Huang told reporters that Nvidia had been hoping for &quot;non-zero market share&quot; in China, but was now expecting zero.</p><p>U.S. national security concerns that the Chinese military could use U.S. technology did not make sense, he added, because China&#39;s own domestically produced AI chips were good enough for their military applications.</p><p>He also said it would be &quot;foolish&quot; to underestimate the incredible competitive spirit of Huawei, which last month unveiled its plans to compete against Nvidia in AI chips.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can&#39;t build systems,&quot; he said. &quot;It is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible competitive spirit of Huawei. This is a company with extraordinary technology.&quot;</p><p>(Reporting by Heekyong Yang, Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul, Eduardo Baptista and Ju-min Park in Gyeongju; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, Clarence Fernandez and Kim Coghill)</p></div></article></div>",

Korea, as CEO Jensen Huang met President Lee Jae Myung and the heads of the country&#39;s biggest companies on the sidelines of the APEC summit.</p><p>South Korea is home to two of the world&#39;s leading memory chip makers -- Samsung Electronics and SK hynix -- which manufacture chips essential for artificial intelligence products and the data centres that the fast-evolving industry relies on.</p><p>President Lee has also expressed his hope that the country can become the world&#39;s third AI power after the United States and China.</p><p>Speaking to media after the announcement, Huang said that goal was &quot;ambitious&quot;.</p><p>But, he said, &quot;there&#39;s no reason why Korea cannot achieve it -- you have the technology, you have the software expertise and you also have a natural ability to build manufacturing plants&quot;.</p><p>Nvidia has been caught in the middle of that geopolitical tussle.</p><p>Its chips are currently not sold in China due to a combination of Beijing government bans, US national security concerns and ongoing trade tensions.</p><p>Huang has urged the United States to allow the sale of US-made AI chips in China in order to ensure Silicon Valley companies remain a global powerhouse in providing artificial intelligence.</p><p>&quot;The US government and the Chinese government have to decide what role they would like Nvidia to play,&quot; Huang told reporters on Friday.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve been very clear that having Nvidia technology in China is in the best interest of the United States and in the best interest of China as well,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m optimistic,&quot; he added.</p><p>And asked if he wanted Nvidia&#39;s most high-tech chip, the Blackwell, to be sold in China, he said: &quot;I hope so&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But that&#39;s a decision for President Trump to make.&quot;</p><p>Nvidia&#39;s chips featured in talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Gyeongju this week.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Beijing has ramped up its chip industry to beat Washington&#39;s export restrictions on the critical component used to power AI systems.</p><p>- Chicken and chips -</p><p>Under Friday&#39;s deal, 50,000 of the graphics processing units will go towards a new &quot;AI factory&quot; being built by Samsung Electronics.</p><p>&quot;By deploying more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs, AI will be embedded throughout Samsung&#39;s entire manufacturing flow,&quot; the Korean tech giant said.</p><p>SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group will also receive 50,000 chips for use in AI facilities.</p><p>NAVER Cloud -- which operates South Korea&#39;s largest search engine -- will receive 60,000 to expand its AI infrastructure.</p><p>A further 50,000 will be deployed across Seoul&#39;s National AI Computing Center and to cloud service and IT providers.</p><p>Huang has sought to forge closer ties with South Korean tech giants in his visit to the country this week.</p><p>He met Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Chung Eui-sun on Thursday for &quot;chimaek&quot; -- a beloved South Korean pairing of fried chicken and beer -- in the capital Seoul.</p><p>The restaurant, Kkanbu, was reportedly chosen by Nvidia because the term -- popularised by Netflix&#39;s megahit &quot;Squid Game&quot; and meaning &quot;friend&quot; -- was intended to highlight the spirit of friendship underpinning their AI and chip collaborations.</p><p>Nvidia in July became the first company to top $4 trillion in market capitalisation, and followed that up by becoming the first to hit $5 trillion following an event on Tuesday where it announced new ventures building on its AI technology.</p><p>hs-cdl-oho/rsc</p></div></article></div>",

reduced to piles of rubble that litter the now-muddy ground.</p><p>“We have nowhere to stay,” Britney Samms, a resident of Black River’s Vineyard District, told CNN.</p><p>Black River was one of the worst-hit places in all of Jamaica. A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.</p><p>Across the Caribbean, at least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.</p><p>In Black river, hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.</p><p>Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.</p><p>“We live in a board house. Everything is gone – dressers, stove – everything is gone,” Samms said, sitting beside other residents next to shopping carts loaded with their remaining belongings.</p><p>It was “a nice, quiet, very docile town,” said a man from a nearby town after surveying the devastation. Now it’s a “hell on Earth,” he said.</p><p>The town’s narrow roads are now cluttered with metal roof panels, slabs of concrete, and all kinds of trash that the water brought in.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vTfADd9.ad6Jja0obRALxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/68b63a11c90bca18d8534598f2a0ddaa><noscript><img alt=\"Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vTfADd9.ad6Jja0obRALxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/68b63a11c90bca18d8534598f2a0ddaa class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Residents gather amid debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa on a street in Black River, Jamaica, on Thursday. - Matias Delacroix/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Agonizing screams often echo through the town as residents walk around in circles, searching for loved ones or taking stock of the damage.</p><p>The heat and humidity are adding another layer of complexity to the recovery efforts.

earnings reports from US tech behemoths Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Investor confidence in artificial intelligence has fuelled a rally in global stock markets this week that made California-based chip designer Nvidia the first $5 trillion firm.</p><p>Rosy sentiment was further boosted by a detente in the US-China trade war, with leaders agreeing on Thursday to walk back punitive measures that had disrupted international supply chains and manufacturing sectors.</p><p>But that boom showed signs of flagging on Thursday as investors processed comments by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell the previous day that cast doubt on another interest rate cut in December.</p><p>The three major Wall Street indices retreated on Thursday, with the Nasdaq dropping the most at 1.6 percent.</p><p>An earnings report released by Apple after US markets closed showed quarterly revenue that beat estimates, powered by iPhone and services revenue.</p><p>Amazon also reported earnings that were better than expected, driven by surging demand for its cloud computing services.</p><p>Tokyo&#39;s main benchmark gained more than two percent on Friday while Seoul added half a percent, with both reaching record closes.</p><p>Japan&#39;s climb came despite a sharp plunge in Nissan shares after the automotive giant said it expected to suffer an operating loss in its current fiscal year ending in
