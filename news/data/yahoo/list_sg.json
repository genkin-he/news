After we ordered, John blurted out, “Wendy is pregnant, and we’re getting married.”</p><p>Thanks to my therapist, who had helped me to see that John’s infidelities were not all about me, my self-esteem had been restored.

She reached out her hand to introduce herself, and as our hands touched, I picked up on a warm friendliness about her. While John loaded the canoe, she and I chatted like friends. After all, she was not the one he had cheated on me with, and I felt no ill will toward her.</p><p>During her pregnancy, Wendy and I frequently bumped into each other in our small downtown. We’d greet each other and make small talk. In May 1985, her daughter was born. Because Wendy was new to our town when she met John, she didn’t know many people, so she asked if I would babysit for her on occasion.

Her 6-Word Response Completely Broke Me.</a></strong></p><p>A few months later on a chilly winter evening, the three of us sat at a round table in a dimly lit restaurant. The small talk lasted for only a few minutes before we shared similar stories of our marriages to the same man. Being the first wife, I began. Then Wendy opened up. Then Suzy.</p><p>“I didn’t know he had been married <em>twice</em> before!” Suzy revealed. “I was standing in my soon-to-be mother-in-law’s kitchen, and I asked her if I should register for wedding gifts. She said, ‘Well, this is his third marriage.’ Of course, I knew about Wendy, but not you, Frances.”</p><p>As the restaurant began to close, we were still chatting, each of us amazed at the similar themes of betrayal and so many of the same lies that had been strung through each of our marriages. Hugging as we prepared to depart, we made plans for a “to be continued” get-together.</p><p>Never in a million years did I imagine I would be sitting at the same table with two of John’s ex-wives. Sharing our stories validated each of our experiences. It was clear his betrayals weren’t about us. Suzy had remarked, “At least he has good taste in women!” On that we all agreed.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 762px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader portrait\" style=padding-bottom:121%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy&#39;s daughter&#39;s baby shower.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ttOLNthFnbgSNSU0V1QoXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTAy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/93c91681af93a1ab9945cf209c973681><noscript><img alt=\"The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy&#39;s daughter&#39;s baby shower.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ttOLNthFnbgSNSU0V1QoXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xNTAy/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/93c91681af93a1ab9945cf209c973681 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The author (left) and Suzy at Wendy's daughter's baby shower. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Frances Scott</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>It had been 30 years since my short marriage to John. During those years, he and I met for lunch a few times. I was always comfortable sitting across the table from him. I realized I had never been in love with him. At 21, I had been grabbing at the chance to save myself, especially after, as a teen, overhearing my father remark about a family friend, “I wonder what is wrong with Ann that she never married.” Ann seemed perfectly fine, but I didn’t want anything to be “wrong” with me. I thought getting married was the only way forward.</p><p>John never apologized for his infidelity, but I didn’t care. I didn’t need his apology.</p><p>Six months after our first gathering, Wendy, Suzy and I sat at Wendy’s dinner table. Our laughter filled the room when she suggested we call ourselves The Triple X’s (***) and that we should open a fine lingerie shop called ***. We made plans to gather again in a few months.</p><p>During our third meet-up, the subject of our ex-husband didn’t come up once. We had other things to talk about: books, music, our work and the going-ons in our community. Suzy asked, “Should we go out dancing next week? There is a good band playing downtown.”</p><p>Eventually we were no longer three women connected by the same ex — we were friends. It’s been 10 years since our first meal together. We now care for one another and enjoy spending time together. We’ve held each other up through hard times: Wendy’s second divorce, Suzy’s stressful job, my cancer. I lived with Wendy for a summer while in between residences. They have both trusted me for their house- and pet-sitting. The first time I dog-sat for Wendy, I felt right at home when I reached into the kitchen cabinet for a plate and found my everyday china from my marriage to John! I started writing this essay while dog-sitting for Suzy.</p><p>When Wendy and John’s daughter got married in 2016, she invited Suzy and me. We had each touched her daughter’s life, and she wanted us there at the beautiful outdoor setting along with her other fun-loving friends, as well as John, his new partner, our ex-mother-in-law and ex-brother-in-law.</p><p>I was excited and honored to be invited and had no concerns about seeing John, but Suzy was nervous. This would be her first time seeing him and his new partner, whom he had divorced Suzy to be with. Wendy and I reassured her we would be there for her. We told her that our mutual ex-husband would witness our connection and see three good choices that ended due to his bad choices.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 488px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:77%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Triple X&#39;s: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John&#39;s daughter in 2016.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1o1orzW.bK6aJ3gnjsuZlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/011a3f753fac4cdac100103ab0dfeb79><noscript><img alt=\"The Triple X&#39;s: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John&#39;s daughter in 2016.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1o1orzW.bK6aJ3gnjsuZlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD05NjI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/011a3f753fac4cdac100103ab0dfeb79 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>The Triple X's: Suzy (left), Wendy and the author, at the wedding of Wendy and John's daughter in 2016. <span class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Frances Scott</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>On that sunny fall day, John, who, despite his infidelity, was always a good father, gave his daughter away. After the ceremony, the bride’s grandmother — my ex-mother-in-law — spotted me, grabbed me and insisted I find Wendy and Suzy for a photo.</p><p><span>Thirty-five years later, I was experiencing a redemption I never imagined: My ex-mother-in-law had sided with her son during our divorce, but now she was hugging me and asking how I was. She never verbally apologized for how she treated me all those years ago, but her actions were apology enough. </span></p><p><span>As Wendy, Suzy and I smiled into the camera, a piece of each of us was healed. Our ex-mother-in-law had recognized her son’s part in our failed marriages. If there was any bit of us that still felt inferior because of how we had been treated by John, it disappeared that day.</span></p><p><span>Since my marriage to John, I’ve been married two more times, and they both also ended in divorce. I’ve finally come into my own and no longer feel I need a man to be complete. Therapy helped me realize I was never actually afraid of being alone, I was afraid of “something being wrong with me” if I didn’t get married. But there isn’t — and there never was. </span></p><p><span>I love my autonomy and I love my life. Now, at 64, I know it’s my friendships that sustain me, and, really, they always have. I’m grateful for Wendy and Suzy and all that we’ve experienced together despite the unusual circumstances that brought us together, and I look forward to sharing many more years of fun and adventure and support with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Note: Some names and details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.</em></p><p><em>Frances Scott lives in Montana, where she writes essays and memoir.

But please don’t worry,” she wrote.</p><p>A friend of Aghayeva, Sabah Bari, described her as a “highly motivated” and “extremely intelligent” person who is involved in student organizations, academically accomplished and “very funny.”</p><p>Aghayeva is on track to graduate in May, said Bari, a student at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health.</p><p>On social media, Aghayeva offers a glimpse into her world, blending library study sessions with motivational messages and hints of her immigrant journey. “As long as I am alive, I can begin again … There is no end.

The officer “asked multiple times for a warrant, which was not produced, and asked for time to call his boss, which was not given,” she said.</p><p>Shipman emphasized law enforcement officers must present a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena to access non-public areas of the university, including residence halls, classrooms and buildings requiring Columbia University ID card access. An administrative warrant, she wrote, is not sufficient.</p><p>“All law enforcement agencies – including DHS and ICE – are obligated to follow established legal and ethical standards. And we expect those standards to be respected,” she said in a statement following Aghayeva’s release.</p><p>“This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,” she said.</p><h3>DHS claims her student visa was terminated</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7><noscript><img alt=\"Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncMKikaIRuiHpmaIktD2mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/eb1852c70ebd8187e17e6de52c7e0be7 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Columbia University neuroscience student Ellie Aghayeva is escorted to her apartment with her face covered, after being detained by DHS agents Thursday morning. - Ryan Murphy/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>DHS confirmed to CNN that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Aghayeva, “whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes.”</p><p>“The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.

born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria before going on to graduate from Columbia, had played a prominent role negotiating on behalf of pro-Palestinian protesters at the university.</p><p>Another Columbia University student, Ranjani Srinivasan, was also detained in March 2025 amid pro-Palestinian protests at Hamilton Hall, even though she maintains <a

administration’s continued attack on universities and immigrants,” the American Civil Liberties Union in New York said in a statement to CNN.</p><h3>What can agents legally do?</h3><p>Without a warrant, federal agents can only enter campus areas of Columbia University that are open to the public such as outdoor walkways, according to CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson.</p><p>They have no legal right to enter residences or restricted university buildings without “specific legal authorization,” which would be a judicial warrant signed by an independent judge or magistrate but not an immigration official, Jackson said.</p><p>Immigration officials, he added, typically sign administrative warrants that may note immigration violations and authorize detention but “do not allow searches and seizures on private property.”</p><p>Columbia’s president has specified that an administrative warrant is “not sufficient” to access the university’s non-public areas, and that federal agents must have a judicial warrant or judicial subpoena.</p><p>Furthermore, tactics that include misrepresentation to gain access would be illegal and against the Constitution, said Jackson.</p><p>In the case of Aghayeva, it appears the law was “flagrantly violated,” which he says has parallels to the cases of 5-year-old <a

Carrillo)</figcaption></div></figure><p>NASA on Friday abruptly said it was shaking up its Artemis lunar program that has suffered multiple delays in recent years, a bid to ensure Americans can return to the Moon&#39;s surface by 2028.</p><p>That goal remains unchanged, but the US space agency is shifting its flight lineup to include a test mission before an eventual lunar landing to improve launch &quot;muscle memory,&quot; NASA administrator Jared Isaacman said.</p><p>That strategic revision comes amid repeated delays to the Artemis 2 mission, which was originally due to take off as early as February, but now will not launch before April.&nbsp;It is meant to see the first flyby of the Moon in more than half a century.</p><p>Earlier this week that mission faced another setback when NASA rolled back its towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft off the launchpad to investigate problems and make necessary repairs.</p><p>The announced changes mean that Artemis 3, which was meant to send

the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil fuel protests in US history (Robyn BECK)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Greenpeace must pay $345 million in damages to the operator of the US oil pipeline it protested, a North Dakota court ordered Friday.</p><p>The decision finalizes this phase of the explosive, yearslong case that has pitted the environmental organization against the company Energy Transfer, opening the door to an appeals process in the closely watched legal saga.</p><p>The Dallas-based energy conglomerate accused Greenpeace of orchestrating violence and defamation during the controversial construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline nearly a decade ago.</p><p>A jury last year took their side, awarding more than $660 million in damages across three Greenpeace entities, citing charges including trespass, nuisance, conspiracy and deprivation of property access.</p><p>Judge James Gion of North Dakota cut those damages in half, determining some damages had been counted twice.</p><p>But the sum remains staggering.</p><p>Greenpeace categorically rejects the accusations, denouncing the proceedings as abusive and a means to silence dissent.</p><p>Legal experts and advocacy groups alike have closely followed the case, given its potentially far-reaching implications for protest mobilization and advocacy movements.</p><p>Greenpeace has indicated its intention to appeal and has repeatedly stated it cannot pay hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>&quot;This legal fight is far from over,&quot; Kristin Casper, Greenpeace International general counsel, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>Marco Simons, another Greenpeace legal official, said &quot;speaking out against corporations that cause environmental harm should never be deemed unlawful.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a setback, but the movement to defend people and the planet has always faced setbacks and resistance, and Energy Transfer will fail in its goal of silencing its critics.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer, meanwhile, has objected to the halving of its award.</p><p>Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School&#39;s climate change law center, told AFP the judgment was &quot;devastating.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;It is very bad not only for Greenpeace, but for the global environmental movement,&quot; he said.</p><p>- Global impact -</p><p>The case could have ripple effects worldwide.</p><p>When the initial verdict dropped last year, environmental defenders rallied around Greenpeace, denouncing the verdict as a chilling attack on climate action around the globe.</p><p>&quot;Fossil fuel companies invest billions in new oil and gas while they spread misinformation, lobby against climate policies, and attempt to silence dissent against their destructive business model,&quot; Allie Rosenbluth, the US campaign manager of Oil Change International, said in a statement to AFP.</p><p>&quot;They must not be allowed to act with impunity.&quot;</p><p>At the heart of the North Dakota court battle was the Dakota Access Pipeline, where from 2016 to 2017 the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe led one of the largest anti-fossil-fuel protests in US history.</p><p>The demonstrations saw hundreds arrested and injured, drawing the attention of the United Nations, which raised concerns over potential violations of Indigenous sovereignty.</p><p>Despite the protests, the pipeline -- designed to transport fracked crude oil to refineries and on to global markets -- became operational in 2017.</p><p>Energy Transfer, however, continued its legal pursuit of Greenpeace.</p><p>After its federal lawsuit was dismissed, it shifted its legal strategy to the state courts in North Dakota, one of the minority of US states without protections against so-called &quot;Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation&quot; or SLAPPs.</p><p>Throughout the yearslong legal fight, Energy Transfer&#39;s billionaire CEO Kelcy Warren, a major donor to President Donald Trump, was open about his motivations.</p><p>His &quot;primary objective&quot; in suing Greenpeace, he said in interviews, was not just financial compensation but to &quot;send a message.&quot;</p><p>Warren went so far as to say that activists &quot;should be removed from the gene pool.&quot;</p><p>Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to AFP&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>Greenpeace maintains that it played only a small and peaceful role in the movement, which was led by Native Americans.</p><p>Greenpeace International in 2025 announced plans to counter-sue Energy Transfer in the Netherlands, where the NGO&#39;s international headquarters are, accusing the company of using nuisance lawsuits to suppress dissent.</p><p>It is seeking compensation for the costs incurred in these legal battles.</p><p>cha-mdo/nro</p></div></article></div>",
