(-)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Markets mostly rose Friday as traders extended their buying at the end of a healthy week in Asia, where tech firms rallied on a reassessment of AI investments.</p><p>After surging for the past two years on a rush into all things linked to artificial intelligence, Wall Street&#39;s Magnificent Seven tech titans have been slow out of the blocks this year amid concerns about extended valuations and profitability.</p><p>Worries about the impact of new tools that many warn pose a risk to a range of companies were compounded by a report on Sunday that signified parts of the global economy that could be at risk from the new gadgets, including credit card and food delivery firms.</p><p>That uncertainty has seen a shift from &quot;downstream&quot; companies that run apps and software to &quot;upstream&quot; firms such as chipmakers, many of which are based in Asia.</p><p>That was highlighted this week by another Wall Street sell-off, despite Nvidia reporting quarterly profits more than doubled, projecting more strong growth for the coming period.</p><p>Analysts said the losses showed firms needed to far exceed even elevated forecasts, making it even harder to please investors who have been piling into tech in recent years.</p><p>&quot;Market expectations were already very elevated and part of the positive results had been priced in,&quot; said City Index&#39;s Julian Pineda.</p><p>&quot;There are also concerns related to stretched valuations and Nvidia’s dependence on capital spending by large technology companies investing in AI infrastructure.</p><p>&quot;If the pace of AI investment moderates due to cost optimisation efforts, it could indirectly affect Nvidia&#39;s growth outlook.&quot;</p><p>Most of Wall Street fell, with the Nasdaq shedding more than one percent.</p><p>Asia started off mixed but went into the home straight on a broadly positive note, with the Supreme Court&#39;s decision last Friday to slap down many of US President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs seen largely benefiting regional economies.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

Wellington all advanced.</p><p>But Seoul sank one percent, having chalked up gains of more than eight percent this week thanks to a surge in market heavyweights Samsung and SK hynix.</p><p>Manila, Mumbai and Jakarta also slipped.</p><p>London opened higher, Paris fell and Frankfurt was flat.</p><p>The yen extended a minor recovery against the dollar after a top Bank of Japan board member again urged officials to continue hiking interest rates.</p><p>However, the case for a pause was boosted by data showing Tokyo&#39;s inflation -- seen as a barometer for the country -- cooled last month.</p><p>The currency came under pressure this week after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi nominated two academics to the BoJ board who are considered policy doves, days after reports said she had told its boss Kazuo Ueda of her concern about tightening further.</p><p>Oil prices rose as investors kept tabs on Iran nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>Mediators said the two sides had made &quot;significant progress&quot; in talks Thursday in Switzerland as they look to avert a war in the crude-rich Middle East. Officials agreed to further discussions next week in Austria.</p><p>The Oman-mediated negotiations follow repeated threats from Trump to strike Tehran, with the US president last Thursday giving it 15 days to reach a deal.</p><p>- Key figures at around 0815 GMT -</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.2 percent at 58,850.27 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.0 percent at 26,630.54 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.4 percent at 4,162.88 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: UP 0.2&nbsp;percent at 10,867.49</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 156.03 yen from 156.11 yen on Thursday</p><p>Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1818 from $1.1799</p><p>Pound/dollar: UP at $1.3493 from $1.3489</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 87.59 pence from 87.47 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: UP 0.8 percent at $65.75 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: UP 0.7&nbsp;percent at $71.22 per barrel</p><p>New York - Dow: UP less than 0.1 percent at 49,499.20 (close)</p><p>dan/lga</p></div></article></div>",

traded on the glamour of owning Harrods, the Paris Ritz and luxury yachts, but Mohamed Al-Fayed was at the centre of a dark web of alleged abuse, say French lawyers for women who liken him to US sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>French authorities began investigating the late Egyptian businessman and his brother Salah last year amid allegations of a vast system of sex trafficking and abuse on French soil.</p><p>&quot;Every time I met Mohamed Al-Fayed, he tried to assault me,&quot; his former personal assistant Kristina Svensson told French police of her two years working at the Ritz.</p><p>Her testimony is all too familiar.</p><p>The alleged crimes of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who died in 2023 aged 94, first came to light in a BBC investigation in September 2024. In it, several young women who worked at his upmarket London department store Harrods accused him of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>British police told AFP that 154 victims have so far come forward to say the former owner of Premier League club Fulham abused them.</p><p>His brother Salah, who died in 2010, is also accused.</p><p>But frustrated by London Metropolitan Police&#39;s investigation of the alleged crimes, which span more than 35 years, some victims have turned to France in the hope of finding justice.</p><p>&quot;In England they&#39;re ignoring the trafficking... They just want to make it about Al-Fayed and Harrods,&quot; said Rachael Louw, a former Al-Fayed employee, speaking for the first time about her ordeal.</p><p>The French investigation, however, is handled by &quot;a unit specialised in human trafficking,&quot; she told AFP.</p><p>It is &quot;a relief that our cases are actually being recognised as trafficking&quot;.</p><p>- Consumed &#39;like meat&#39; -</p><p>Louw was 23 when her bosses sent her to Salah Fayed&#39;s yacht on the French Riviera. Now after 31 years she was able to testify about what happened there to French investigators on February 10.</p><p>Louw told AFP she was first &quot;spotted&quot; by Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1993 while working as a sales assistant at Harrods. Shortly after, she was placed on a management training scheme, which required her to submit to a medical exam by a Harley Street doctor before being employed by the chairman&#39;s office in the summer of 1994.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The medical appointment went far beyond a standard checkup, with a pelvic exam and &quot;thorough breast exam&quot;, smear and HIV tests.</p><p>And the results were not kept confidential.</p><p>The report, seen by AFP, was handed over to Harrods, and described Louw&#39;s personal life: her parents&#39; separation when she was young, her father living in the United States and the death of her mother and grandmother.</p><p>The doctor also noted that she took a birth control pill, had a boyfriend and was in &quot;excellent&quot; health.</p><p>The doctor &quot;sent confidential information to arm the rapist&quot;, said French lawyer Eva Joly, who is representing Louw and another former Al-Fayed assistant.</p><p>&quot;These young women were like meat, and they wanted to know if they were fit to consume,&quot; said Caroline Joly, another member of the legal team.</p><p>Several encounters were arranged between Louw and Salah Fayed at his home in London&#39;s glitzy Park Lane, where Louw said she was drugged with &quot;a crack cocaine mix&quot;.</p><p>Louw was then offered a job as an assistant to Salah in France and she was sent there by private jet.</p><p>She said she refused further drugs, &quot;and because he didn&#39;t push anymore, I thought it was okay&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;no&nbsp;reason&nbsp;not to trust&nbsp;this&nbsp;man... this&nbsp;was&nbsp;my&nbsp;first job&nbsp;from&nbsp;university.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;I didn&#39;t feel safe&#39; -</p><p>Staff confiscated her passport as she flew from London&#39;s Luton airport to his yacht. And once she arrived, &quot;nothing&quot; resembled the job she signed up for.</p><p>&quot;I thought I was supposed to be filing paperwork, making arrangements, organising office work,&quot; she said.</p><p>Instead &quot;there was no office, no normal working hours, no time off. I was expected to just be with him&quot;, she said.</p><p>Louw recalled appearing alongside Salah Fayed at dinners attended by elderly, wealthy men with &quot;young girls and lots of touching&quot;.</p><p>When she managed to call her boyfriend, who worked at Harrods, he was fired.</p><p>One night, Louw woke up to find Salah in her bed, claiming he was lonely, she said.</p><p>&quot;I went ramrod straight and the rest of the night I was awake just lying there petrified,&quot; she said, fearing any movement would be an invitation for him to touch her.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know what he would do to me... I didn&#39;t feel safe.&quot;</p><p>She saw other young women in the Fayeds&#39; orbit.</p><p>On a trip to Saint Tropez she encountered a red-headed &quot;young girl&quot;, possibly younger than herself, sunbathing on Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s yacht that was moored just off his villa. </p><p>&quot;Mohamed starts rubbing lotion all over this girl, she&#39;s wearing a bathing suit and then he started to kiss her,&quot; Louw told AFP.</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember anything else&quot; of that day, she said, &quot;so I don&#39;t know if there were drugs, I can&#39;t say for sure whether I was drugged that afternoon,&quot; she added.</p><p>What jolted her to escape was the prospect of being trapped alone with Salah after he bought a speedboat with only one bedroom, telling her &quot;that he would take me to sail around the Italian coast&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I knew that if I went on that boat nothing good would happen,&quot; she said.</p><p>Panicked, she booked the first Air France flight out and worked up the courage to ask for her passport back, which she received although it was clear Salah &quot;was very angry&quot;.</p><p>Home again, &quot;I had&nbsp;blocked out&quot; the details of what happened, she said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to&nbsp;remember.&quot;</p><p>For decades she feared she was bound by a confidentiality agreement she had signed at her interview, but seeing other victims speak out against Al-Fayed in 2024, she reconsidered.</p><p>&quot;How can I be silent?&nbsp;There has to be a cost to what the perpetrators did. Because if they go unpunished, it emboldens the next man.</p><p>&quot;If we women do not speak up we become complicit in our own oppression... powerful men will never change a system that benefits them.&quot;</p><p>- &#39;Organised system&#39; -</p><p>Despite the deaths of the brothers, the women hope investigators can still track down who enabled the trafficking network.</p><p>&quot;There is no such thing as a small piece of information. Every element is useful for the investigation,&quot; Al-Fayed assistant Svensson said, calling on victims and witnesses to speak to police.</p><p>The Swedish woman arrived in France in 1993 and was placed by a temp agency at the Ritz in 1998, then owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed, as his assistant.</p><p>Svensson, aged 30 at the time, was to help him manage his affairs after the death of his son Dodi with Princess Diana in a Paris car crash, perceived as a prestigious assignment.</p><p>During her interview with the Ritz management, the questions posed were &quot;focused&quot; on her appearance and her personal background, she said, even pointing out that she was the &quot;spitting image&quot; of Al-Fayed&#39;s wife.</p><p>The Ritz then sent her to Harrods in London for an interview with Al-Fayed himself, and organised&nbsp;accommodation for her at a luxury residence he owned.</p><p>&quot;I had brought my CV. He wasn&#39;t interested in that. He only asked me personal questions.&quot;</p><p>What followed was a regular pattern of meetings with Al-Fayed. Svensson said she was left in a room alone for hours with no instruction, until he eventually arrived and she would endure sexual assault and attempted rape during which &quot;he&#39;d laugh&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I hoped that in time he would see that I wasn&#39;t interested in him and that he would take me seriously,&quot; Svensson told police.</p><p>&quot;I was a foreigner, with no family or network in the country, no knowledge of French labour law, and no one to lean on financially if I quit.&quot;</p><p>In retrospect, Svensson compares herself to a closely watched &quot;luxury product&quot; which Al-Fayed wanted to possess -- &quot;a doll on a shelf&quot;.</p><p>Al-Fayed was born Mohamed Fayed in Alexandria, but later changed his surname to the grander Al-Fayed, while his brother kept the original family name.</p><p>-&nbsp;London investigation &#39;continues&#39; -</p><p>At the Ritz, she recalls that staff warned her that there were &quot;microphones and cameras in every corner&quot;. And at a villa in Saint Tropez, she said a housekeeper suggested that she block her bedroom door at night.</p><p>The Ritz Paris told AFP in a statement that it was &quot;deeply saddened by the testimonies and the allegations of abuse&quot; and that it is &quot;ready to fully cooperate with the judicial authorities. Our teams do not tolerate any form of inappropriate behaviour, which would be a serious breach of our code of conduct.</p><p>&quot;We want to express our deepest respect to the women who spoke out,&quot; it added.</p><p>Harrods said it &quot;continues to support the bravery of all women in coming forward. Their claims point to the breadth of abuse by Mohamed Fayed and again raise serious allegations against his brother, Salah Fayed. The picture that has emerged suggests that this pattern of abusive behaviour took place wherever they operated.&quot;</p><p>They said more than 180 survivors had already received counselling support through its independent advocate. The store also urged survivors to claim compensation through the Harrods Redress Scheme.</p><p>London&#39;s Metropolitan police said its &quot;investigation into those who could have facilitated or enabled Mohamed Al-Fayed&#39;s offending continues&quot; and urged victims to come forward.</p><p>&quot;The way the Met works has moved on immeasurably, and our teams have transformed the way we investigate rape and sexual offences.&quot;</p><p>Lawyers for the two women say their testimony helps sketch the outlines of a &quot;powerful system&quot; of trafficking which resembles the one established during the same period by Epstein.</p><p>&quot;As with Epstein, with the Al-Fayeds there is a frenzied consumption of young women and an organised system to procure them,&quot; said lawyer Eva Joly, a former judge and European parliament member.</p><p>&quot;The pattern is the same: selecting vulnerable young women, transport, accommodation, isolation and money, which is used to intimidate or corrupt,&quot; she said.</p><p>And as with the Epstein case, while the statute of limitations may have expired, an investigation into the Al-Fayeds can still establish the facts and identify any victims whose cases could be still prosecuted.</p><p>&quot;We are only at the beginning of piecing the puzzle together in France,&quot; Joly insisted.</p><p>clw-fbe/giv/fg/jj</p></div></article></div>",

The Ministry of Defence will be reviewing its Medical Classification System (MCS) to refine the deployment of national servicemen, with details to be announced later in the year.</p><p>Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing said the system will be made more precise, to allow better characterisation of the medical fitness of servicemen and how that affects their ability to undertake various tasks.</p><p>Coupled with ongoing efforts to redesign roles and vocations, the refreshed MCS will enable servicemen to be more meaningfully and effectively deployed, including to vocations that they were not previously eligible for, he said during the debate on the ministry’s budget on Feb 27.</p><p>Singapore currently uses the Physical Employment&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;(PES) system to<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/life/pre-enlistment-medical-checks-and-tests-to-determine-ns-training-and-vocation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:grade pre-enlistees and servicemen for national service.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"> grade pre-enlistees and servicemen for national service.</a> Across the SAF, police and Singapore Civil Defence Force, the grades - from PES A to PES F - determine one’s vocation during the NS period.</p><p>Changes to the MCS will largely impact future cohorts of full-time national servicemen (NSFs) when they enlist.</p><p>An average of 21,300 NSFs enlisted annually across the SAF and Home Team between 2021 and 2025. This was a drop from the annual average of 23,400 enlistees in the preceding five years, Mr Chan said in a parliamentary reply on Feb 12.</p><p>Mr Chan said the review is being done in consultation with public medical specialists and members of Mindef’s specialist advisory boards.</p><p>“With more precision, this ensures that our servicemen are deployed only to vocations that they are medically assessed to be suited for,” he added. “The robust safety and training system in Mindef and SAF will continue to ensure that our servicemen in redesigned roles can train and operate safely.”</p><p>Mindef first raised the idea of reviewing the MCS in 2021, to shift away from the binary classification of combat-fit versus non-combat-fit deployment for purposes of deployment, noting that medical exclusions that used to limit deployments might no longer be relevant in today’s operational context, especially with the latest technology.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>At the debate on Mindef’s budget that year, then-defence minister Ng Eng Hen said the system was “outdated and retrogressive” for roles in the next-generation SAF, and makes little sense when applied to roles such as unmanned vessel operators. The refreshed system will also take into account national servicemen’s (NSmen) civilian jobs and skillsets, he added.</p><p>Mindef said on Feb 27 that the MCS review complements its efforts to redesign roles to optimise servicemen’s contributions.</p><p>Since 2021, the SAF has redesigned 2,000 roles across 25 vocations - including combat medics, infantry platform operators and army technicians - enabling over 1,800 NSFs to be deployed in a wider range of operational roles than they were previously eligible for.</p><p>In his Feb 27 speech to the House, Mr Chan said the SAF does not take the commitment of NSmen and NSFs lightly, and that his ministry is invested in making the most of their time both in NS and during reservist.</p><p>“We strive to bring out the best in every serviceman, so that they can contribute more meaningfully and effectively in line with their abilities,” he said.</p><p>“This is especially since today’s SAF has a greater variety of roles to deal with an expanded spectrum of operations. Many of these new roles no longer depend solely on traditional notions of physical or operational fitness.”</p><p>Mr Chan said this will require mindset shifts regarding servicemen’s abilities, as combat categorisation in the past tended to stream people based on what they could not do.</p><p>“We can unlock our people’s potential if we shift towards focusing on what they can do,” he added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mindef-to-review-medical-classification-system-to-ensure-meaningful-deployment-of-servicemen?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

The government aims to cut this by at least 15 million tons this year, said ​two government officials and one industry source.</p><p>The South Asian country still relies on coal for three-fourths of its electricity generation, even as it ramps up renewable energy at a record pace toward its 2070 net-zero goal.</p><p>New Delhi wants to reduce reliance on imports for the country&#39;s nearly 17 gigawatts of power plants built to run on imported coal as government-backed Coal India and private miners have boosted domestic ‌coal production.</p><p>Authorities aim to replace at least ⁠20% of imported coal with domestic supply at most plants, with some able to go up to 30%, government and power company sources said.</p><p>The seven people Reuters spoke to did not want to be ⁠named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.</p><p>India&#39;s coal and power ministry did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments.</p><p>The government has long sought to cut coal imports for the power sector, but those efforts have failed as power plants have been unable to ​burn ​lower-quality local coal.</p><p>An executive with a power plant in western Gujarat state ​said power plants won&#39;t be able to use ‌as much domestic coal as the government wants without totally recalibrating their boilers, which would be very costly and require state subsidies.</p><p>However, the government has assured power producers that domestic coal supplies will be of high quality, one of the people involved in the testing said.</p><p>Coal India has been struggling with inventories of around 90 million tons as of December 31, after producing a record 781.1 million tons in the fiscal year to March 2025.

located two minutes from the future Sungei Bedok MRT station - will also free up land currently occupied by six existing live-firing ranges, which can be repurposed for other training needs, said Mr Chan.</p><p>Announcing the new facility at the debate on his ministry’s budget, Mr Chan said training its people for a more complex environment is as important for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) as acquiring technology and hard capabilities.</p><p>Besides increasing range capacity, MMRC 2 will be equipped with a video targetry system, said the minister. Unlike static paper targets, such systems offer dynamic scenarios that test soldiers’ judgement, as well as their ability to engage moving targets at different heights.</p><div class=caas-iframe-wrapper data-embed-anchor=f77b686b-87ae-586d-9751-c09cf838cb89><div class=\"caas-iframe youtube\" style=padding-bottom:56% data-type=youtube><blockquote data-src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EWUrTo7Ido?feature=oembed allowfullscreen><div class=caas-card-loader></div><noscript><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EWUrTo7Ido?feature=oembed allowfullscreen></iframe></noscript></blockquote></div></div><p>In his speech, Mr Chan said conventional capabilities remain core to a strong and credible defence, and the SAF will continue to modernise and upgrade itself to keep pace with threats.</p><p>The air force will acquire three Gulfstream G550 Maritime Surveillance Aircraft to replace the Fokker-50s that have been in service since 1993.</p><p>The new planes follow Mindef’s announcement in September 2025 that the city-state <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-acquire-4-new-maritime-patrol-aircraft\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:will buy four Boeing P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">will buy four Boeing P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft</a> to refresh its maritime security capabilities.</p><p>Together, both aircraft will support the SAF’s mission of safeguarding the Republic’s sea lines of communication, said Mr Chan.</p><p>The SAF will also continue to use unmanned platforms for new concepts of operation, pairing them with manned systems. On this note, the navy is on track to launch the second of its six Victory-class multi-role combat vessels (MRCV) in the third quarter of 2026, he added.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The MRCVs have the combat capability of modern frigates, but are also designed to function as “motherships” for unmanned aerial, surface and underwater systems. They replace the missile corvettes that have been in service since 1989.</p><p>Beyond physical hardware, Mr Chan said the SAF must also continue to build capabilities in the cyber domain, as cyber and digital tools are increasingly used by opponents to exert pressure “just short of full scale war”.</p><p>“As a deeply digitally-integrated country, we have a larger surface area of attack as our systems are tightly coupled,” he said. This deep integration also means that the lines between civilian and military targets are blurred, and we are no strangers to such tactics being deployed against us.”</p><p>As such, the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) will upgrade its Cyber Defence Test and Evaluation Centre (CyTEC) to a Cyber Defence Test and Experimentation Centre that can simulate more sophisticated cyber defence scenarios.</p><p>The DIS will also better organise its national servicemen (NSmen) with relevant cyber expertise into sectoral cyber defence teams aligned with the nation’s critical information infrastructure sectors (CII) to strengthen the resilience of these sectors, said Mr Chan.</p><p>CII sectors here include energy, water, transport and infocomm.</p><h2>MMRC 2 to provide 75 per cent time savings</h2><p>The new indoor range in Bedok follows the one in Pasir Laba that was inaugurated in 2013.</p><p>Mindef said that while the current MMRC has reduced the time needed for unit level-live firing from a full day to half a day, MMRC 2 will allow individual soldiers to complete their shooting requirements in under two hours, or a time savings of about 75 per cent.</p><p>Once it is operational, NSmen will be able to book range slots through the OneNS app, similar to how they can currently book slots for their individual physical proficiency tests.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 1126px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:91%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0.YZ.W9blXVCq627X0stLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMTI2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c02eb68492f56e47e44bd8e05c204bc7><noscript><img alt src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0.YZ.W9blXVCq627X0stLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD0xMTI2/https://media.zenfs.com/en/straits_times_442/c02eb68492f56e47e44bd8e05c204bc7 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div></figure><p>Speaking to the media on Feb 25, the Army’s head of training development branch Senior Lieutenant-Colonel (SLTC) Jonathan Liu said the SAF continuously strives to optimise its use of land, and to train with “as efficient a footprint as possible”.</p><p>The new facility will have an annual throughput of about 120,000 personnel, and allow four live-firing ranges at Safti and two at Nee Soon to be repurposed for other training.</p><p>The SAF will then have six remaining outdoor ranges at its disposal: two at Nee Soon, two on Pulau Tekong and two at Poyan. These are needed to facilitate training with SAF platforms and for soldiers that need to consistently train in an outdoor environment, said SLTC Liu.</p><p>SLTC Liu said MMRC 2, which will have six 100-metre ranges, will be able to simulate a range of operational environments. These include peacetime contingency operations where the SAF supports the Ministry of Home Affairs in homeland security, in locations such as Changi Airport.</p><p>The facility will also be able to capture marksmanship performance data to provide personalised feedback for individual firers, helping them improve.</p><p>Concluding his speech on Feb 27, Mr Chan said Mindef and the SAF will continue to transform to defend Singapore against tomorrow’s threats, but this has to be coupled with the whole of society staying vigilant.</p><p>He noted that recent conflicts showed many examples of advanced militaries failing to respond even when presented with clear intelligence of threats, because they convinced themselves that attacks would not happen to them.</p><p>“These are all warning lessons for us,’ he said. “Every day of peace is another day where the dangers of complacency heighten (and) we must never let this happen under our watch.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/singapore-to-build-new-multi-mission-range-complex-in-bedok-by-2031?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Foreign Affairs.</figcaption></div></figure><p>SINGAPORE – Singapore cannot let foreign actors impose their narratives or exploit differences, and decisions about its future must be made solely by Singaporeans, said political office-holders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Feb 27.</p><p>Speaking partly in Mandarin during the debate on her ministry’s budget, Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sim Ann told the House that the first line of defence against foreign influence campaigns is a vigilant and discerning public.</p><p>“Decisions about Singapore’s future must be made by Singaporeans and Singaporeans only, free from external manipulation,” she said.</p><p>At a time of fragmentation when trust and consistency are in deficit, Singapore must continue to be clear-eyed about its national interests, said Ms Sim. It has to assess its options dispassionately and make hard-nosed decisions that are only in Singapore’s interest.</p><p>“Most importantly, we must stand on our own two feet. We cannot rely on others to secure our interests and our destiny,” she said.</p><p>There are situations where Singapore sometimes has to say no, after careful consideration, to partners and friends. Doing so is not easy, and is made more challenging with foreign infiltration in Singapore’s information space, she added.</p><p>She said Singaporeans should be particularly careful when they come across content that highlights or appeals to one particular ethnicity over another.</p><p>“On the whole, we should be vigilant towards online commentaries targeted at Singapore. Some of these could be attempts to undermine our confidence, or exploit our fault lines,” she said in Mandarin.</p><p>With a diverse, digitally connected population, Singapore is an attractive and vulnerable target, she noted.</p><p>Ms Sim added that the development of advanced digital tools has supercharged the ability of foreign actors to seed narratives and even mount hostile information campaigns to advance their interests, and such activities have clearly increased.</p><p>Speaking on the same issue but in Malay, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim said foreign actors may impose their narratives, exploit Singaporeans’ differences and pressure them to see and accept their views.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“But we must remain calm in judgment, clear in principle and direction, and confident in our values. We must stay united and strengthen our social compact.”</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain said Singapore’s national interest is its guiding compass in foreign policy.</p><p>“We must continue to clearly identify and assert our national interests - be it safeguarding our sovereignty or protecting our social cohesion - and use our capabilities to chart the right path,” he said.</p><p>To deal with these external pressures, Singapore must continue to build domestic support for foreign policy, suggested MPs such as Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence and Foreign Affairs.</p><p>MFA has stepped up engagement efforts with Singaporeans, said Ms Sim.</p><p>These include students, youths, businesses, and grassroot leaders, through closed-door dialogue sessions and workshops to help Singaporeans better understand Singapore’s operating context and foreign policy considerations.</p><p>“Foreign policy begins at home,” said Ms Sim.</p><p>“Our ability to stand firm on the world stage depends on having our people’s trust and support, and our ability to remain calm and collected in the face of challenging external circumstances. We can only act with confidence if Singaporeans are united behind us.”</p><h2>Advancing global partnerships</h2><p>Mr Yip and Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) asked how Singapore is advancing partnerships with middle powers in the aspects of geopolitics, trade and technology.</p><p>Ms Sim said that one key strategy is to strengthen and expand Singapore’s partnerships with like-minded countries, including major and middle powers.</p><p>“With this circle of trusted friends, we will forge ahead in both critical sectors like defence cooperation, but also in new and exciting domains such as energy, technology and sustainability,” she said.</p><p>Singapore upgraded its relationships with Australia, France, India, New Zealand, and Vietnam to the level of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2025.

It has supported over 163,000 foreign officials through training and capacity-building programmes, with 60 per cent of SCP’s participants coming from Southeast Asia.</p><p>Even as Singapore is expanding external partnerships, MFA is strengthening consular support for Singaporeans overseas, she said.</p><p>Besides enhancing its eRegister system for Singaporeans travelling overseas, its 24/7 Consular Response Centre provides effective and timely support for Singaporean travellers.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-cannot-let-foreign-actors-exploit-differences-public-must-be-vigilant-and-discerning-mfa?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.

Singapore has to retain its ability to say “no” to others even if it has to pay a price for staking out its position on issues, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.</p><p>Speaking in Parliament on Feb 27, he noted that the Republic will face more strategic dilemmas and difficult choices in a tumultuous world. On some issues, Singapore’s interests will not always be aligned with the great or middle powers, or its immediate neighbours.</p><p>But as pressure to take sides mounts externally and domestically, the country has to stand firm and say no, Dr Balakrishnan said in a speech that laid out Singapore’s foreign policy stance during the debate on his ministry’s budget.</p><p>“Sometimes we will pay a price for staking out our position,” he said. “But...if we ever lose that ability to say no, then that is the day that Singapore loses its relevance, indeed our independence.”</p><p>It is not about choosing sides, but upholding principles and Singapore’s long term national interests, he added.</p><p>He told the House that a new stable equilibrium will not emerge in 2026, with the world now more dangerous for small countries.</p><p>While the global order that used to underpin Singapore’s success has ended, the country has the agency, resilience and resources to chart its own course, he said, describing the current situation as “not just a small tremor, (but a) geostrategic tectonic plate rupture”.</p><p>Singapore will exercise its agency to articulate its positions – which have not been universally welcomed in the past – that align with its national interests, he said.</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan acknowledged that Singaporeans will have different views on foreign policy issues, though they do not necessarily have to agree on their stances.</p><p>“But we must agree that these are matters to be discussed and decided by Singaporeans alone,” he said.</p><p>“With increased global contestation, foreign actors will want us to see and accept their views. They will try to seed their narratives. There may be attempts to create fake news or deepen internal division.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Singapore must be aware that geopolitical contestation has become a tussle for hearts and minds, and exercise caution as the diverse population here is vulnerable to becoming polarised and fractured, he added.</p><p>In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan cited past examples where Singapore had consistently called out violations of international law – when <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russias-putin-announces-a-military-operation-in-ukraine\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Russia invaded Ukraine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Russia invaded Ukraine</a> and in relation to the United States’ actions in Venezuela.</p><p>“We took these stands because a world based on ‘might is right’ is more dangerous for Singapore,” he said.</p><p>Singapore has also expressed disappointment with <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/singapore-tariffs-to-stay-unchanged-as-trump-imposes-new-10-global-levies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:the US tariffs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">the US tariffs</a> that contravened the principles of a rules-based trading system and mechanisms like the most favoured nation principle.</p><p>“Trade is our lifeblood,” said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that the Republic’s total trade is more than three times its gross domestic product.</p><p>“Jobs, investments, and living standards depend on our predictable access to external markets.”</p><p>Singapore also took clear positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-strongly-condemns-terror-attacks-on-israel-calls-for-end-to-violence\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:condemning the Oct 7, 2023 attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">condemning the Oct 7, 2023 attack</a> and stating that Israel’s military response has breached international humanitarian law, he added.</p><p>He reiterated Singapore’s national interests: to safeguard sovereignty, independence and national unity; to secure access to essential supplies and freedom of navigation; to strengthen its role as a global hub for trade and other areas; and to support a rules-based multilateral order wherever possible.</p><p>Going forward, as a small state, Singapore must try to shape its environment and carve out conditions most conducive for its survival and success.</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan said his ministry will do this by engaging all great powers constructively and giving them a stake in the stability and prosperity of the region, as this provides small states like Singapore with room to manoeuvre.</p><p>Several MPs like Mr Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) and Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC) raised concerns about US-China tensions and Singapore’s ability to navigate this, to which Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore wants to work with both countries “where our interests coincide”.</p><p>“And where our interests diverge, we will have to courteously stand up and say no,” he said, adding that there must be an understanding that it is not personal decision, or done as a proxy for either side, but based on a principal assessment of Singapore’s national interests.</p><p>“The reality is that all countries, including Singapore, will have to find creative ways to work with both the US and China,” he said.</p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also work to strengthen a wider network of middle-power partnerships for greater stability – such as by upgrading partnerships and opening more diplomatic missions – and deepening regional integration for Asean to remain relevant.</p><p>The regional grouping remains a cornerstone of the Republic’s foreign policy, said Dr Balakrishnan, noting that Singapore will assume the Asean chairmanship in 2027.</p><p>“This is a heavy responsibility, but also an opportunity. We will use our chairmanship to pursue deeper integration and promote external partnerships,” he said.</p><p>“We will work to keep the Asean region open for business, open to the world, and committed to peace, stability and cooperation.”</p><p>Dr Balakrishnan said his ministry will also build greater synergy between Singapore and its immediate neighbours.</p><p>Responding to Mr Patrick Tay (Pioneer) on stepping up engagement with Malaysia and Indonesia, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore has resolved longstanding issues with Indonesia and is exploring mutually beneficial projects in energy, food security, education and healthcare.</p><p>With Malaysia, the leaders meet regularly for candid discussions which have led to beneficial regional partnerships.</p><p>“At the same time, we must manage outstanding bilateral issues that are complex and will take time to resolve. We will always be close neighbours so we cannot afford to allow spiky issues to undermine our overall positive cooperation.”</p><p>The minister also agreed with MPs Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) and Lee Hong Chuang (Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC) on the need to continue support for the multilateral system.</p><p>Singapore remains committed to the World Trade Organisation but achieving consensus among 166 members is difficult, he noted.</p><p>Instead, Singapore will aim for high-ambition agreements with like-minded partners that are inclusive so others can join when ready.</p><p>Concluding his speech, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that Singapore is in a far better position today to deal with the various challenges, with the prerequisites for success in place: domestic unity, economic relevance and defence capabilities.</p><p>He noted that domestic unity is a work constantly in progress, especially in the face of forces that seek to divide its people.</p><p>“As long as we can inoculate ourselves from foreign influence, as long as we can disagree maturely and ultimately, still forge a domestic consensus, we will continue to thrive,” he said.</p><p>“We cannot be bought or bullied by anyone.”</p><p>Singapore’s economic vitality and relevance to the world as a “trusted, stable hub” also cannot be taken for granted, and must be preserved, said Dr Balakrishnan.</p><p>“There is a premium in such a world for stability, consistency and respect for the rule of law.”</p><p>Additionally, Singapore’s steady spending on defence - ranging between three to six per cent of GDP for almost six decades - has also allowed the Republic to defend itself.</p><p>“We must preserve this capability, because it keeps us safe - and we are a country that can hope for the best, but also prepare for the worst,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-must-retain-ability-to-say-no-even-if-it-has-to-pay-a-price-for-position-on-issues-vivian?utm_source=b8f711c7d1&amp;utm_medium=cf-syn\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Source: The Straits Times © SPH Media Limited.
