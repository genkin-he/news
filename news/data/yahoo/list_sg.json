immense risks and years of future consequences.</p><p>But the reported death of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei opens up a scenario in which Tehran’s brutal Islamist regime is overthrown, ending decades of repression that saw <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/middleeast/iran-protesters-crackdown-pressure-intl?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow

Khamenei, whom he described as “one of the most evil people in history” was killed in an air strike. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said earlier that Khamenei was safe.</p><p>The demise of Khamenei — the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the instigator of the 1979 Iranian revolution — would be a seismic political event in Iranian history. It would threaten the grip on power of hardline Islamists who turned Iran into a ruthless theocratic dictatorship.</p><p>It would also add urgency to one of the most critical questions raised by Trump’s assault: Would the removal of top leaders unleash a torrent of institutional reform, or set off uncontrollable political forces that would deepen repression and tear the country apart?</p><p>Trump told NBC the attacks had “inflicted tremendous damage.”</p><p>“At some point they’ll be calling me to ask who I’d like (as leader),” Trump said. He added: “I’m only being a little sarcastic when I say that.”</p><p>No one needs reminding of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/28/politics/regime-change-iran-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:treacherous possibilities of foreign wars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">treacherous possibilities of foreign wars</a> that begin with shock-and-awe violence but can unravel disastrously.

It seems to end Trump’s diplomatic quest for a deal with Iran that now looks like a ruse as a fearsome US force gathered.</p><p>Trump’s fleeting public arguments ahead of the strikes were incomplete and self-contradictory. He insisted, for instance, that he’d already “obliterated” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/politics/nuclear-program-iran-trump-strike?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Iran’s nuclear facilities;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Iran’s nuclear facilities</a>, which formed a key rationale for Saturday’s attack.</p><p>His claims that the nuclear program and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/trump-iran-geneva-talks-middle-east-war-iraq-analysis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:long-range missiles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">long-range missiles</a> posed an immediate risk to the United States are overblown and contradict US intelligence assessments reported by CNN. The president even seemed to admit publicly that the threats were not so imminent as to justify immediate US action. “We’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future,” Trump said in a video released from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida early Saturday.</p><p>But this is now another American operation based on questionable claims of immediate national security peril. In this, it recalls the war waged on false pretenses in Iraq that destroyed President George W. Bush’s second term. And it will alienate Trump from sectors of his own MAGA movement.</p><p>“It’s always a lie and it’s always America Last,” Trump’s former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene <a href=\"https://x.com/FmrRepMTG/status/2027746247684075987\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:wrote on X.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">wrote on X.</a> “But it feels like the worst betrayal this time because it comes from the very man and the admin who we all believed was different and said no more.”</p><h3><strong>The opening that Trump saw and past presidents lacked </strong></h3><p>If Trump’s decision casus belli was impulsive, its broader rationale was familiar. The US and its allies have long tried to thwart Iran’s push toward nuclear weapons. They’ve also been fixated on its long-range missiles and a proxy terror network that made it a pernicious regional power.</p><p>But if a crisis point had not been reached, why did Trump act now?</p><p>The new dimension in the US-Iran standoff is the weakness of the Tehran regime. This created an opening the US and Israel might rue missing if they didn’t act.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran, March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hc8Q8tf2JR_eqg7s6VXPjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f96df22f7860c314f021573b4243af51><noscript><img alt=\"Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran, March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hc8Q8tf2JR_eqg7s6VXPjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f96df22f7860c314f021573b4243af51 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei arrives to cast his vote during parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran, March 1, 2024. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Iran has been locked in worsening political turmoil. Khamenei’s succession process has been opaque. Iranians are hungry and desperate after decades of iron-fist repression. The economy is splintered by international sanctions and disruption to the most basic services, such as food and water distribution. Israeli attacks have pummeled regional proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah that were once an insurance policy against US and Israel action.</p><p>Although Iran launched frightening counterattacks by firing missiles against Israel and US allies in the Gulf, the potential costs of a US effort to destroy the regime are perhaps lower now than they have ever been.</p><p>When Trump called on Iranians to revolt against their government in his message, he was trying to leverage these political factors to catalyze change.</p><p>“The factor that clearly seems to have changed is the level of hatred that people of Iran have for the regime, given the massacre that happened back in January,” said Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “So if you’re sitting in the White House, or if you’re sitting in Jerusalem, you look at this as a window of opportunity. The regime is weak. It’s not just the sanctions … it’s the fact that they did what they did and kept massacring their own people, and so that creates a window of opportunity.”</p><p>The president also needed to rescue himself. His repeated warnings that the US would protect protesters in Iran during the recent uprising meant that a failure to act risked deepening Tehran’s repression and shattering his own credibility. And he makes no secret of being motivated by vengeance. He had frequently warned Iran was steeped in the blood of Americans following years of terror attacks and the Tehran-backed militia killings of US soldiers during the occupation of Iraq.</p><p>And Trump, more than most of his modern predecessors, is enthralled by the ruthless application of American military power.</p><p>A commander in chief nearing 80 is also a man in a hurry. The chance to be the president who solved the Iran conundrum that bedeviled every predecessor since Jimmy Carter must have been tantalizing. But his hubris will leave his legacy condemned by history if he’s made a bad bet.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Smoke rises following an explosion in Tehran after Israel and the US launched strikes on Iran on Saturday. - Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/X8oCw1_MB2Tl9cK7Ezh3RA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ac4008cf9ef5c834d442f25611731372><noscript><img alt=\"Smoke rises following an explosion in Tehran after Israel and the US launched strikes on Iran on Saturday. - Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/X8oCw1_MB2Tl9cK7Ezh3RA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ac4008cf9ef5c834d442f25611731372 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Smoke rises following an explosion in Tehran after Israel and the US launched strikes on Iran on Saturday. - Majid Asgaripour/WANA/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><h3><strong>Consequences could linger for years </strong></h3><p>Trump has not just committed the United States to toppling a foreign government. He’s trying to end a revolution — a process that he will struggle to influence, especially in the absence of US ground troops.</p><p>Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, warned of “consequences that will outlast this presidency.”</p><p>“Against the clear wishes of the American people, President Trump has thrust our nation into a major war with Iran — one he never made a case for, never sought congressional authority for, and for which he has no endgame,” Reed said in a statement.</p><p>Several key factors will shape the conflict in the short term.</p><p>► Will US and Israeli strikes succeed in taking out the top level of Iranian leaders?</p><p>► Assuming reports of Khamenei’s death are true, will Iranians heed Trump’s call to take to the streets, take over their country and end the Islamic Revolution’s stranglehold?</p><p>► The possibility of a regional conflagration remains acute. But do Iran’s initial reprisals — which were alarming but limited — betray diminished capability or a desire to keep options in reserve?</p><p>► Eyes will soon turn to Trump’s staying power. The president prizes quick wins; he is adept at tearing things down, but has shown less capacity for building something in their place. He told Axios on Saturday, however, that he was ready to stay the course if necessary. “I can go long and take over the whole thing, or end it in two or three days and tell the Iranians: ‘See you again in a few years if you start rebuilding (nuclear facilities).’”</p><p>► The domestic response to Trump’s move will also be important. He’s saddled with his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/polling/approval/trump-cnn-poll-of-polls?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:worst-ever approval ratings;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">worst-ever approval ratings</a> ahead of November’s midterm elections. Polls show that majorities of Americans believe he doesn’t share their priorities.</p><h3><strong>What could go wrong? </strong></h3><p>The best day for the United States in recent wars — in Afghanistan and Iraq, for instance — has come early in a conflict where the massive, overwhelming advantage of US military force looks decisive.</p><p>Even if its regime is overthrown and top leaders are killed, a transition to a democratic, nonthreatening Iran may still be a pipe dream.</p><p>If the authority of central government breaks down, anarchy could erupt. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seem to have calculated this is a worthwhile risk to remove Khamenei. But it could seed decades of regional instability.</p><p>“I think the calculus, is that in some sense, stars have aligned with regard to the weakness of the regime internally — the kind of battle that it’s facing domestically, plus its regional defeats and its reduced capacity for retaliation,” said Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Now, all of that may not add up to a change in the regime. This is a strong and, in some ways, resilient country, but what is the risk?”</p><p>While Lesser said there’s little chance of a regime worse than the current one, the danger persists that Trump’s operation is “inconclusive, and that the regime strikes out in ways that may only manifest themselves months and years to come, in terms of support for proxies, in terms of support for state-sponsored terrorism in the West generally.”</p><p>Another danger — seen as the most likely scenario by US intelligence assessments cited by CNN — is that the clerical regime could simply be replaced by equally hardline remnants of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. A classic strongman Middle East government might mean imminent threats to the US or Israel. But it would fall far short of the popular awakening Trump hopes for.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"People walk near a mural featuring images of Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and leader of Iran&#39;s 1979 Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on a street in Tehran February 17. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8ZJooUMq3GLe9V_dPPygvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4654d964b56b4c26e071daa38388a29d><noscript><img alt=\"People walk near a mural featuring images of Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and leader of Iran&#39;s 1979 Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on a street in Tehran February 17. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8ZJooUMq3GLe9V_dPPygvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/4654d964b56b4c26e071daa38388a29d class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>People walk near a mural featuring images of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and leader of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on a street in Tehran February 17. - Majid Asgaripour/Wana News Agency/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>The worst-case scenario is a disintegration of central control in Tehran over major cities that leads to armed factions creating rival fiefdoms that pose a serious risk of civil war and national fracturing.

But Iran has a much simpler goal than Trump: an outcome that ends with the current regime in place equals victory.</p><p>“Iran has prepared itself for a long war,” an Iranian source with knowledge of the country’s military strategy told CNN’s Frederik Pleitgen.</p><p>It’s too early to predict a quagmire.</p><p>But this new war already has its defining irony. Trump — who rose to power on a tide of angst over foreign wars — is now the latest president to willingly plunge into a new Middle East conflict.</p><p>“He has so much respect for American force, but that’s just part of the equation,” Vatanka said. “American force without any strategic objective in mind is essentially useless. You can just blow up anything you want, but doesn’t mean much. That doesn’t mean you’re going to end up with a better product.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei &quot;was unable to avoid our Intelligence and Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems&quot; and had been killed.</p><p>&quot;Heavy and pinpoint bombing... will continue, uninterrupted throughout the week or, as long as necessary to achieve our objective of PEACE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST&quot;, Trump said.</p><p>Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran&#39;s late shah, hailed the reported killing of Khamenei, saying the Islamic republic was entering the &quot;dustbin of history.&quot;</p><p>The joint US-Israeli operation began earlier on Saturday with smoke rising over Tehran after strikes that Israel said were pre-emptive.</p><p>Shortly after, Trump announced US combat operations against Iran, with the goal of &quot;eliminating imminent threats&quot;.</p><p>Israel&#39;s military said it targeted multiple sites where senior Iranian officials had gathered in Tehran, and launched strikes against Iranian missile launchers.</p><p>It said 200 fighter jets had taken part in the &quot;extensive attack&quot;, hitting more than 500 targets.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks killed senior Iranian officials and warned that thousands more targets would be struck in the coming days.</p><p>The Iranian judiciary&#39;s Mizan Online website said 108 people died in a strike on a girls school in Minab, citing a provincial official who blamed Israel.</p><p>AFP was unable to access the location to verify the toll or the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p><p>- Missile, drone wave -</p><p>In response, Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards said they targeted the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and other American bases in the Gulf, after launching a first wave of missile and drone attacks at Israel.</p><p>Israel&#39;s Magen David Adom emergency service said a woman was killed and at least 21 injured in the Tel Aviv area.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button

Arab Emirates said it intercepted a second wave of Iranian strikes, after a first killed one civilian in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The country&#39;s defence ministry later said that 137 missiles and 209 drones were fired at its territory.</p><p>Witnesses in Dubai said they heard an explosion and saw missiles streak across the sky, and witnesses told AFP they heard an explosion and saw smoke rising from the man-made island The Palm. Four people were injured.</p><p>Dubai airport was damaged and four staff were injured in an &quot;incident&quot;, it said.</p><p>AFP correspondents in the Saudi capital Riyadh heard loud explosions, as well as in Bahraini capital Manama and across Qatar&#39;s Doha.</p><p>Qatar&#39;s defence ministry said it had intercepted several missile attacks targeting the Gulf state.</p><p>A drone struck Kuwait&#39;s international airport and a base housing US personnel was targeted. Three Kuwaiti soldiers and 12 other people were wounded, authorities said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia condemned Iranian attacks targeting its neighbours, but made no mention of attacks on the kingdom.</p><p>Jordan said it had intercepted 13 ballistic missiles.</p><p>Explosions were also heard near the US consulate in Iraq&#39;s Erbil, according to AFP journalists.</p><p>Two people were killed in air strikes on an Iraqi military base housing the powerful pro-Iran group Kataeb Hezbollah, which threatened the US with a response.</p><p>Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards also moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway through which much of the world&#39;s oil and gas passes.</p><p>- Allied support, warnings -</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron called for an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting over the escalation.</p><p>Oman&#39;s foreign minister, who has been mediating talks between Tehran and Washington, said he was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the violence.</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Canberra supports the US action against Iran, while the UK expressed fear the military strikes could blow up into &quot;a wider regional conflict&quot;.</p><p>The European Union said developments in Iran were &quot;perilous&quot;.</p><p>UN chief Antonio Guterres said military action in the Middle East &quot;carries the risk of igniting a chain of events that no one can control&quot;.</p><p>Gulf states condemned Iran&#39;s &quot;cowardly&quot; attacks in a joint statement read by Bahrain&#39;s ambassador during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.</p><p>Russia slammed the strikes as a &quot;dangerous adventure&quot; that could spark regional &quot;catastrophe&quot;.</p><p>Pakistan condemned the &quot;unwarranted attacks against Iran&quot;, and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas slammed the strikes on its backer.</p><p>Another Iranian ally, Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah militant group, called on countries and people in the region to stand against Israel and the US.</p><p>- Airspace closures, flights nixed -</p><p>Qatar&#39;s civil aviation authority said the Gulf state&#39;s airspace had been temporarily closed. Iraq closed its airspace while Syria closed part of its airspace for 12 hours.</p><p>Russia cancelled commercial flights to both Iran and Israel &quot;until further notice&quot;.</p><p>Air France cancelled its Tel Aviv and Beirut flights, while Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines were among several carriers that suspended flights to the region.</p><p>Israel closed Gaza&#39;s Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Saturday as a security measure.</p><p>jfx/amj/wd/des</p></div></article></div>",

REUTERS/Stringer - Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>After the United States and Israel launched a regime change operation against Iran on Saturday morning, footage emerging on social media and geolocated by CNN offered a window into its impacts.</p><p>The attacks have hit prominent Iranian military targets and have resulted in the killing of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to a Truth Social announcement from President Donald Trump. One strike killed scores of students in an elementary school in southern Iran, according to state media.</p><p>In retaliation, Tehran has carried out attacks across the Middle East. Footage from at least five Arab countries that host US military bases – including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar – show the range of sites struck by Iran, from a US Navy facility to Dubai’s luxurious Palm Jumeirah district.</p><p>Following initial reports of strikes across Iran’s capital, footage surfacing from inside Tehran showed extensive damage to several key political and military buildings.</p><p>The US and Israeli joint attacks appear to show the targeting of senior political figures at the compound of Iran’s supreme leader.

At least 85 students have died at the Shajaba Tayyiba School, according to state news agency IRNA, which cited the prosecutor of Minab city, where the school was located. Red Crescent put the toll higher, at 108.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The school sits about 200 feet (60 meters) from an Iranian military base and previously appears to have been part of that facility, but satellite imagery shows that it has been separated from the base since at least 2016. Another video reviewed and geolocated by CNN shows multiple fires burning at the military base next to the school.</p><p>Asked about the strike, US Central Command spokesperson Tim Hawkins said “we are aware of reports concerning civilian harm resulting from ongoing military operations. We take these reports seriously and are looking into them. The protection of civilians is of utmost importance, and we will continue to take all precautions available to minimize the risk of unintended harm.”</p><p>Shortly after the start of the US-Israeli attacks, Iran began a swift round of counter strikes targeting locations across the region, including multiple US military bases. Iran also launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Israel, according to Nour News, an outlet affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p>According to the IRGC, al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, al-Salem Air Base in Kuwait, al-Dhafra Air Base in the UAE, and the US naval base in Bahrain have been targeted. Muwaffaq al-Salti Air Base in Jordan was also targeted, according to Iranian state media, as well as a US base in northern Iraq.</p><p>One of the most notable strikes captured on video was an Iranian strike on the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.</p><p>In one video filmed near the US Navy’s military base in Manama, Bahrain, an Iranian Shahed drone is seen directly making impact with a radar dome at the facility. The drone attack occurred near an earlier strike on the Fifth Fleet.</p><p>Iranian drones have also struck commercial and residential targets in the Persian Gulf. Multiple videos geolocated by CNN show a Shahed drone attack near the Fairmont Hotel in Dubai, causing a large explosion and fire.</p><p>The Fairmont is in Dubai’s high-end Palm Jumeirah, a densely settled manmade set of islands off the city’s beach, known for its luxury apartments, hotels and restaurants.</p><p>Several videos from Bahrain show one of the Shahed drones striking the upper floors of the Era Views Tower, a high-rise residential building roughly a mile from the US Navy base.</p><p>In Kuwait, a drone attack on the country’s international airport left several people injured and caused limited damage to the passenger terminal, according to Kuwait’s Civil Aviation Authority. Video recorded from inside the airport appears to show the aftermath of the strike.</p><p>By evening on Saturday, a producer in CNN’s bureau in Tel Aviv shared video of a projectile making landfall amid warning sirens. One of the missiles appeared to pierce Israel’s aerial defense array and hit the Tel Aviv area, setting off a large explosion and sending a large dark cloud into the sky.</p><p>The US and Israeli operation is expected to last several days, according to two sources, and the Israel Defense Forces said the strikes had been planned in close coordination with Washington for months. As Tehran’s retaliation continues, Iran’s army said it will deliver a “historic lesson” to the US and Israel.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

leader Ali Khamenei, a pillar of its theocratic system since the Islamic revolution whose death was announced by US President Donald Trump on Saturday, saw off multiple crises over the decades, remaining defiant to the very end.</p><p>There has been no confirmation from Tehran of his death, but Trump posted on his Truth Social site that &quot;Khamenei, one of the most evil people in history, is dead&quot; after the United States and Israel launched a massive wave of strikes targeting sites across Iran, including the supreme leader&#39;s Tehran compound.</p><p>Aged 86, Khamenei dominated Iran for the last three-and-a-half decades since taking on the post for life in 1989 as leader of the Islamic republic following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p><p>He remained in power after overcoming 1999 student demonstrations, 2009 mass protests sparked by disputed presidential elections and 2019 demonstrations that were brutally suppressed.</p><p>He also survived the 2022-2023 &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; movement sparked by the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.</p><p>Khamenei was forced to go into hiding during the 12-day war against Israel in June, which exposed deep Israeli intelligence penetration of the Islamic republic that led to the killing of key security officials in air strikes.</p><p>But he survived that war and, after nationwide protests again shook Iran earlier this year, he emerged defiant as ever.</p><p>- Tight security -</p><p>Khamenei lived under the tightest security, and his relatively infrequent public appearances were never announced in advance or broadcast live.</p><p>As supreme leader he never set foot outside the country, a precedent set by Khomeini following his triumphant return to Tehran from France in 1979.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s last known foreign trip was an official visit to North Korea in 1989 as president, where he met Kim Il Sung.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>There had long been speculation about his health given his age, but there was nothing in his most recent appearance to fuel any new rumours.</p><p>Khamenei&#39;s right arm was partially paralysed following an assassination attempt in 1981 that authorities have always blamed on the People&#39;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) group, one-time allies of the revolution now outlawed in the country.</p><p>- &#39;I am opposed&#39; -</p><p>Repeatedly arrested under the shah for his anti-imperial activism, Khamenei shortly after the Islamic revolution became Friday prayer leader of Tehran and also served on the front line during the Iran-Iraq war.</p><p>He was elected president in 1981 following the assassination of Mohammad Ali Rajai, another attack blamed on the MEK.</p><p>During the 1980s, Khomeini&#39;s most likely successor was seen as the senior cleric Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri, but the revolutionary leader changed his mind shortly before his death after Montazeri objected to the mass executions of MEK members and other dissidents.</p><p>When Khomeini died and the Islamic republic&#39;s top clerical body the Assembly of Experts met, it was Khamenei whom they chose as leader.</p><p>Khamenei famously initially rejected the nomination, putting his head in his hands in a show of despair and declaring, &quot;I am opposed&quot;.&nbsp;But the clerics stood in unison to seal his nomination and his grip on power never slackened.</p><p>Khamenei worked with six elected presidents, a far less powerful position than supreme leader, including more moderate figures such as Mohammad Khatami who were allowed to make stabs at cautious reform and rapprochement with the West.</p><p>But in the end, Khamenei always came down on the side of hardliners.</p><p>He was believed to have six children although only one, Mojtaba, had public prominence. He was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2019 and is one of the most powerful backstage figures in Iran.</p><p>A family dispute also caught attention: his sister Badri fell out with her family in the 1980s and fled to Iraq in the war to join her husband, a dissident cleric.</p><p>Some of their children, including a nephew who is now in France, became vehement critics.</p><p>sjw/dcp/smw/amj</p></div></article></div>",
