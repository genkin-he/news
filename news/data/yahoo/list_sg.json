Since then, Tisch has made her mark on the department, replacing many loyalists of former Mayor Eric Adams who were in positions of power, shuffling others around, and accepting the resignation of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/21/us/nypd-jeffrey-maddrey-resigns?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey </a>after he was embroiled in an overtime-for-sexual-favors scandal.</p><p>She’s also touted the importance of the controversial NYPD gang database used to track gang members, attacked the “Raise the Age” law, which increased the age of criminal prosecution from 16 to 18, and gone after bail reform laws – all positions that are at odds with Mamdani.</p><p>The candidate has also spoken out about disbanding the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – an elite unit that specializes in responding to major events, whether they be protests or even the midtown mass shooting at 345 Park Ave. Mamdani also wants the final disciplinary decision on officers to go from the police commissioner to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with oversight of the NYPD – though that would need a change to the law. Both are ideas that routinely spark sharp criticism from law enforcement circles.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aLH_MPxj5_cKGW6Vjc9GQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/0d97dc3e005954b3e89b79d413413baf><noscript><img alt=\"An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aLH_MPxj5_cKGW6Vjc9GQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/0d97dc3e005954b3e89b79d413413baf class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An officer stands in a street as police respond to a shooting in Midtown Manhattan on July 28. - Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Despite the seeming differences, if Tisch were to stay, it would provide stability for officers not only out on the street, but for high-ranking officials who would otherwise be walking on eggshells inside police headquarters as they wait for a new administration to take over.</p><p>“I think it calms a lot of the cops who may have been nervous.

The agency would focus on a community-based prevention approach targeting homelessness and people experiencing mental illness.</p><p>Its hallmark won’t be adding more police but rather adding more mental health professionals and violence interrupters – a plan Mamdani says he hopes would free up officers to respond to other crimes.</p><p>In 2023, the NYPD responded to under 180,000 calls that involved an emotionally disturbed person, out of roughly 9 million 911 calls, according to statistics unveiled at a city hall hearing in 2024.</p><p>Corey said he tried to get a similar plan off the ground but had trouble with appropriate staffing.</p><p>“The city is not the greatest employer when it comes to pay. You’re going to hire clinicians and social workers and people with advanced degrees. You’re not going to pay them a whole lot of money,” Corey said. “Then you’re going to tell them, ‘Oh, by the way, you know you’re working Christmas morning, or you’re working the midnight shift every weekend.’ These are the challenges we ran into when we’ve tried to do that before, even as a co-response model. There are just not enough of these clinicians and mental health professionals who are willing to go out into the street and do this kind of work in the hours that it needs to be done.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dF263EPnoe27Kn.4MGnmPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/591e76154cc720ddaae972af0621e0b2><noscript><img alt=\"Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dF263EPnoe27Kn.4MGnmPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/591e76154cc720ddaae972af0621e0b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa participate in the second New York City mayoral debate at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, on October 22. - Hiroko Masuike/AFP/Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p><a href=\"https://nycrimecommission.org/richard-aborn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Richard Aborn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Richard Aborn</a>, president of the nonprofit Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, supports mental health professionals being involved but wonders about safety.</p><p>“I think it makes a lot of sense to have mental health teams go on calls when there’s an emotionally disturbed person, but having a mental health team go exclusively could be dangerous,” Aborn said. “The question is, how are you going to assess that? A call comes into 911, there’s a person locked up in the bedroom screaming, ‘I’m going to kill you.’ Who’s going to assess whether it’s just a mental health team or if police officers go along?”</p><p>Corey recalled a scenario when a woman called 911 asking for help for her son, telling dispatchers they were nonviolent.</p><p>“If you heard her, she almost sounded like she was sleeping,” Corey said about the woman’s 911 call. “And she’s just ‘no, he’s not violent.

She became the fourth police commissioner appointed during the Adams administration – a constant change that became emblematic of the instability and air of corruption at the department.</p><p>Meanwhile, the department is struggling with staffing issues as members continue to either retire or get poached by other police departments in other cities. There are currently less than 35,000 members with the NYPD, a figure that’s less than highs in 2000 and 2019, according to statistics provided by the Police Benevolent Association.</p><p>So far this year, roughly 300 officers have left the department each month, according to the union’s statistics. NYPD recruit classes continue to lag behind the number of recruits in previous classes, according to a union official.</p><p>As staffing is a constant issue, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to potentially add 5,000 new police officers to the department by 2029, a move that would boost the department’s headcount to the largest it’s been in the last 20 years.</p><p>While the move opens the door to adding more officers, it still leaves the issue of actually finding enough recruits to fill the hiring surge. In April, city officials changed the eligibility standard for recruits, eliminating the need for college credit. The move bolstered applications, with 4,000 ineligible applicants – who did not meet the requirements – reopening their cases, according to city officials.</p><p>Mamdani, who credited Tisch with rooting out corruption, believes she has shown during a turbulent period that she’s committed to the department.</p><p>The high turnover among top police executives, is something Corey says rank and file officers – who may find themselves having to execute progressive strategies they may not agree with – have noticed.</p><p>“What the cops have learned at the bottom is that, ‘If I don’t like your idea, I don’t actually have to do it,’” Corey said. “‘I just need to slow walk it, because you’re going to be gone soon, and so will your idea.’”</p><p>CNN’s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

the main opposition candidates being either jailed or disqualified.</p><p>But a heavy crackdown and the lack of options sparked mass protests around the country.</p><p>&quot;The government strongly

Roger Wicker of Mississippi) said Friday. The Trump administration has not publicly released the basis for its growing offensive, but there have reportedly been internal struggles over whether the strikes are justifiable, and fears of being seen as arguing otherwise among government lawyers. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who led the U.S. Southern Command, retired earlier this month after clashing with Hegseth over the legality of the attacks, according to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/southern-command-caribbean-strikes-holsey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>CNN</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Among those monitoring the situation is Harrison Mann, a 13-year Army officer now with the progressive group Win Without War. Mann. Mann quit his last military job at the Defense Intelligence Agency over U.S. support for Israel’s devastating offensive in Gaza, which itself appeared to violate U.S. and international law, and has in recent weeks helped organize a national campaign of billboards and other outreach called “Not What You Signed Up For?” to inform U.S. soldiers about resources for legal counseling and community support as the Trump administration has used the military in unprecedented ways abroad and domestically. It’s “a frightening and isolating experience” to receive orders that may be unlawful and try to assess how to react and it’s “increasingly a possibility,” Mann said, so the effort seeks to help individuals avoid violations.</span></p><p><span>HuffPost discussed developments around Venezuela with Mann on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 420px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:67%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56><noscript><img alt=\"A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America.\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VBmTAtBuSqdQ7i.QNZz7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/66b8f47b5b76b8ae5b65d330e8644f56 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A billboard erected outside SOUTHCOM, the U.S. military branch overseeing ongoing and expanding operations in Latin America. <span class=\"copyright\">OUTFRONT Media</span></figcaption></div></figure><p><strong>Thinking back to being on the inside at a moment like this, with the U.S. spiraling into conflict and a pretty unclear mission, whether narcotics or regime change, how would you be feeling about it — and how do you imagine folks being asked to carry out these orders in Latin America are? What are their options? And what’s your sense of whether legal efforts, like court challenges against the Trump administration’s domestic deployment of troops, will be fast enough to catch up, given how quickly the actual deployments are moving?</strong></p><p><span>A lot of them are probably hoping that they don’t get asked to do something illegal. When we look at all the strikes on boats that have happened so far, that’s dozens, probably hundreds, of uniformed service members in terms of how many it takes from getting an order to actually dropping a bomb or doing a drone strike on one of these boats who participated in something that they were quite confident was not legal. That’s still a small minority of all of the troops who have now been deployed to the region, between the Air Force and the growing number of Navy ships that we have outside of Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-johnson-adelita-grijavla_n_69052e61e4b0060501ac5325?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">GOP Senator Urges Mike Johnson To Swear In Arizona Democrat After Weeks-Long Delay</a></strong></p><p><span>In government in general, at higher echelons you have lawyers who are assigned to you who are meant to be your counsel, JAGs if you’re in the military. But as you go further down the ranks, you don’t have legal consultation. If you’re a more junior officer or a junior enlisted, you’re taking it on good faith that the orders you’re receiving have been run through some kind of legal review and are going to be lawful, and I think that assumption is increasingly in question with how this administration has deployed the military both in the Caribbean and in American cities. Our campaign put a billboard [near] SOUTHCOM but we started with National Guard deployments and the broader issue of the administration trying to use the military in illegal ways… which has both moral implications and legal implications for the people who choose to give those orders and the people who choose to carry them out.</span></p><p><span>I hope that legal challenges carry the day, but I don’t think it’s wise to expect that or have total faith that that’s gonna happen. In terms of domestic deployments, if the president invokes the Insurrection Act, then he can put both Guard and active-duty troops basically anywhere he wants. And when we’re talking about overseas strikes and the potential war in Venezuela, the legal constraints to that were really abandoned a long time ago with Congress abandoning its role in constructing and containing foreign policy. In some ways the boat strikes are crossing new red lines in terms of illegal use of the military but a lot of folks have pointed out that the legal justifications for these strikes are not dramatically flimsier than the justifications for a lot of bombings around the Middle East for the past 10-plus years over multiple presidents. There was already a precedent that the president could blow up anybody who he said was a terrorist to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The scariest part from an American perspective about the strikes in the Caribbean so far is that at the same time that members of the Trump administration are calling a broad swath of Americans terrorists, via [</span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/how-nspm-7-seeks-to-use-domestic-terrorism-to-target-nonprofits-and-activists\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:National Security Presidential Memorandum 7;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>National Security Presidential Memorandum 7</span></a><span>] and via public statements by people like Stephen Miller, they’re also asserting their right to drone strike anybody the president calls a terrorist.</span></p><p><strong>We’re at this moment after chaos in Hegseth’s office, the firing of a lot of top commanders, skipping over some to appoint those perceived as loyal, and removing an independent press corps at the Pentagon. Is the U.S. military establishment in a position to be managing this kind of operation and how concerned are you about transparency and the chain of command now?</strong></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-times-trump-prediction_n_690507c2e4b0b48d8a1c6705?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Pre-Election, All-Caps New York Times Headline Goes Viral For Prophetic Warnings About Trump</a></strong></p><p><span>Are they administratively capable of continuing to bomb people? I think yes.

What we don’t know is whether the officers who take their place are going to feel the same way. What I can’t tell you is how much solidarity there is at the flag officer rank… or if that replacement is going to learn the lesson that Hegseth is trying to teach them, which is “get in line or I’ll fire you.” It remains to be seen what behavior we’re going to see from our upper echelon in military leadership.</span></p><p><strong>Presidents finding creative legal justifications to kill people abroad and Congress letting them do it is not new. Looking at the escalation now and the limited guardrails against it, are you thinking about lessons that could have been learned from the post-9/11 War on Terror? And specifically lessons from U.S. intervention in Latin America for decades? How is that history being overlooked and what could we take from it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>We should understand these events as continuation of the War on Terror – we never rejected that logic. We pulled some troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the idea we should be unilaterally bombing without a clear connection to how that makes Americans safer and the contention that anybody you call a terrorist is somebody you can then bomb or detain or otherwise mistreat outside of the law was never really challenged.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The lesson I would hope we learned from America’s history in Latin America is that setting aside the moral objections to regime change in countries in the region, it’s also disastrous for us politically and economically. Whatever you think of Venezuela now, turning it into a warzone is not going to make it more stable, solve the economic crisis there or stem the refugees that are flowing into neighboring countries and contributing to burdening some of the resources of countries in the region. The lesson that folks like [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio learned is that we just didn’t try hard enough in the 1980s and now we finally have an opportunity to finish the job. Their theory is that if you regime-change Venezuela, that will cut off their oil to Cuba, so then you can regime-change Cuba. These people learned no lesson of not giving up on the foreign policy of 50 or 60 years ago.</span></p><p><strong>Politics: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-snap-food-stamps_n_6904f12de4b00c26f071625a?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Judges Tell Trump Administration It Can&#39;t Withhold Food Benefits</a></strong></p><p><strong>The anti-war movement generally faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Some have felt that with Trump’s “America First” line and MAGA base, which questioned intervention against Iran alongside Israel, those conservatives could be helpful. How are you thinking about organizing around this?</strong></p><p><span>In</span><span>execution, “America First” seems to have led to a lot of foreign interventions. I am encouraged when Americans from every political affiliation oppose dangerous and unnecessary foreign intervention; it’s to me too soon to see whether that has translated into an actually more rational foreign policy. The trend you’re talking about certainly exists … but it’s way too soon to say that it’s really going to restrain the foreign policy of the president or of his party. I wish it did, I hope it does, but it certainly seems that the death of the neocons has been highly exaggerated.</span></p><p><span>One aspect of Trump’s second term is that he’s performing exaggerated versions of policies that we’ve had for 20 years and he’s doing it without attempting to justify it in moral terms, and that makes it easier for a lot of people to understand why this kind of interventionism is wrong. On Capitol Hill, some representatives who were not interested in pushing back against foreign interventions are getting a little more interested. In part because of the awakening effect of U.S. support for the genocide in Gaza, there’s certainly a lot more Americans who are paying attention to how the U.S. comports itself abroad. I’ve been heartened to see at least in the Democratic Party pretty consistent positions against these interventions without a lot of equivocating, and to see some Republicans start at least rhetorically moving against them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ll have to see what votes come out for a war powers resolution against intervention in Venezuela.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My organization sees this as a moment to explain to people in this country and to elected leaders why they have to pay attention to the connection between foreign policy and our lives here at home. And I think putting the National Guard in our streets while we start blowing up random people in boats makes it a lot easier to explain that what we do overseas doesn’t stay there.</span></p><p><strong>Sufficient pushback, a climbdown by Venezuela or just Trump volatility are probably our ways out of this, or maybe it’s some combination of all three. In terms of damage and danger until that happens, what barometers will you track to understand this situation, in terms of human life, violations of U.S. and international law and broader instability going forward?</strong></p><p><span>Domestically I’ll be looking at how many members of Congress and other institutions speak out against it and try to prevent it. I’m personally thinking about what echelons of our military leadership acquiesce versus push back against what could be patently unlawful orders... we shouldn’t assume the first strike is gonna be on a Venezuelan military base. It could be something the administration thinks is a drug lab but turns out to be somebody’s house; it could be civilian or political leadership. If and when this begins, there’s already been a massive economic refugee outflow from Venezuela in part because of sanctions we’ve applied. I’ll be looking at not just the loss of life but the number of people who have to flee.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We’ve seen Trump personally be satisfied with showy actions that he can call a win. Iran fits that bill, to a lesser extent the Gaza ceasefire [in January] did. I don’t know whether that will work in Venezuela given the success so far of his hawks, which in this case includes both [Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor] Stephen Miller and Marco Rubio.</span></p><p><em><span>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</span></em></p><h3>Political Updates</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/snap-websites-are-hitting-back-at-the-gop-by-giving-them-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine_n_6904ecb8e4b0b48d8a1c505f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Blue State SNAP Webpages Are Giving The GOP A Taste Of Its Own Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-the-view_n_69047b34e4b0d05408abd167?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">&#39;Hell Just Froze Over&#39;: Talk Show Announces Marjorie Taylor Greene As Guest</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rand-paul-slams-trump-strike-venezuela-drug-vessel_n_68b989f3e4b0e20f601acde8?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Rand Paul Slams Trump For Unilateral Strike On Suspected Drug Vessel: &#39;Where Does It End?&#39;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-venezuela-escalation-war_n_69052bc3e4b0060501ac52e2?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",

Drone footage shared by an unofficial Russian Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers fanning out from a Blackhawk helicopter. Eleven of the troops that had landed were killed, the Defense ministry claimed. It’s unclear when the mission took place.</p><p>A source in Ukrainian intelligence told CNN that the claim was untrue. Stabilization efforts led by the head of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov continue in Pokrovsk, the source added.</p><p>The Ukrainian 7th Aerial Assault Corps also said there had been a successful landing in the Pokrovsk area. “It was a complex operation that required the synchronized actions of various units,” it said.</p><p>Ukrainian units have managed to improve their tactical position in several districts of the city, according to the Corps. “We are increasing the number of assault groups in Pokrovsk,” it said, adding that 85 Russian soldiers had been killed in Pokrovsk over the past week.</p><p>By contrast, the Russian Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that its units “continue to destroy surrounded Ukrainian Armed Forces formations in the area of the railway station” in Pokrovsk, and had repelled several attempts by Ukrainian forces to break out of the town. It added that the encirclement of Pokrovsk and neighboring Myrnohrad was tightening.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that about 200 Russian troops had infiltrated Pokrovsk. Geolocated video has shown Russian soldiers in the southern part of the town, moving in small groups.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Ukrainian forces have tried to counter-attack, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, and had marginally advanced north of the town.</p><p>On Thursday, the commander in chief of Ukrainian forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said after meeting commanders in the Pokrovsk area that the situation was “difficult, but the statements of Russian propaganda about the alleged blockade” of Ukrainian troops “do not correspond to reality.”</p><p>Syrskyi said Russian troops were accumulating in urban areas and changing locations. “In addition to UAVs, strike-search operations are being conducted in the city,” Syrskyi said, adding that he had given orders to “strengthen the protection of supply and evacuation routes.”</p><p>Were Pokrovsk to fall, it would be the largest urban area to be taken by Russian forces since they seized Bakhmut in May 2023. The town is a junction for road and railway lines and occupying it would bring Russian forces closer to the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in the industrial belt of Donetsk.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/daf60R5JMfCGUW4kZ3zUhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/399dc96ef19c326260e52920e7d7363c class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian artillerymen fire an M114 self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops near Pokrovsk on October 15, 2025. - Anatolii Stepanov/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>According to the unofficial Ukrainian DeepState website, which analyzes the battlefield, Russian forces gained 267 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in October — the same as in September.</p><p>Efforts by the US President Donald Trump to get a ceasefire agreed in Ukraine have come to nothing, with the Kremlin insisting that the root causes of the conflict - including NATO’s expansion eastwards and what it has called the “Nazification” of Ukraine - must be addressed before there can be a truce.</p><p>Moscow has said that the original goals of what it calls its Special Military Operation are non-negotiable: sovereignty over four eastern regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk.</p><h3>Pipelines blown up</h3><p>As Russian forces edge forward along several parts of the frontline, Ukraine have continued their long-range efforts to destroy and disrupt Russia’s energy and military infrastructure.</p><p>On Friday, Ukrainian saboteurs blew up up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to the country’s defense officials – the latest attack in a campaign by Kyiv to target refineries, pumping stations and pipelines.</p><p>“The ‘Koltsevoy’ oil pipeline, which supplied the Russian occupation army,” was disabled on Friday in a special operation, according to a statement from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI).</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2><noscript><img alt=\"Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine&#x002019;s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DH_poYAA2GfsQgUD3Jc93A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f3287d553f1132159fd934ad2d6501b2 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Ukrainian saboteurs blew up three pipelines carrying fuel in the Moscow region, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DI). - From Defense Intelligence of Ukraine</figcaption></div></figure><p>It published an image showing what appeared to be devices placed on three separate pipelines near Ramenskoye, south of Moscow, which were under anti-drone netting.

Is this the kind of coercive diplomacy you’ve written about or something else?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> It’s firstly important to clarify what we mean by a “nuclear test.” Russia has tested missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. But, in the traditional sense, a nuclear test is a denotation of a nuclear explosive device. Think of the July 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert that you may have seen depicted in the 2023 film “Oppenheimer” (although after the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, most nuclear explosive tests were done underground rather than in the atmosphere). This is not what Russia has done, and I don’t believe this is what the US is threatening to resume, either.</p><p>There are two main reasons why countries test military technologies. The first is to see whether a weapon works as designed. The second is to send a political message to other countries. I think there’s a certain amount of signaling attached to Russia’s recent missile tests. Although it’s difficult to decipher Moscow’s intentions, in testing these technologies, the Kremlin may be implicitly saying to the United States and NATO: Back off in Ukraine — look what we might do if you continue to interfere.</p><h3>More worried about a nuclear crisis today than four years ago</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Do you generally think the threat of a nuclear standoff has increased in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>I’m more worried about the possibility of a serious nuclear crisis today than I was at the end of 2021. This is in large part because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the possibility that Moscow may continue to brandish its nuclear arsenal to help it prevail in that war. But it’s not just that. The possibility of a US-China nuclear standoff over Taiwan is not trivial, especially if one side misinterprets the other’s resolve to fight. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are expanding too, and there is the potential for disaster on the Korean Peninsula arising from an accident or miscalculation. Not to mention the perennial possibility of a nuclear-tinged crisis between India and Pakistan. This doesn’t mean that the probability of a standoff is high. Actually, I still think it’s relatively low. But given the stakes involved, even a small increase in the risk — say, 2% — is cause for concern.</p><h3>Do US missile defenses work?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Coincidentally, there’s a movie on Netflix about the 30 minutes it would take for an intercontinental ballistic missile to reach the US and the difficulty of intercepting such a missile. The Pentagon felt the need to produce a memo responding to the film. Are missile defense systems any better than the coin toss suggested by the movie?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> I haven’t seen the movie yet. I’ll leave that question to technical experts who understand the intricacies of missile defense systems better than I do. I will say that, from a strategic standpoint, there’s value in convincing your adversaries that your missile defense systems are impenetrable. This can strengthen deterrence: If adversaries believe their missiles won’t get through, they may be less likely to fire them.</p><h3>Would Trump’s Golden Dome solve the nuclear threat?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Trump (taking cues from Project 2025) has called for a new “</strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/golden-dome-missile-test-election?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Golden Dome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><strong>Golden Dome</strong></a><strong>” missile defense shield. Is it worth the cost and would that do anything to solve the nuclear threat?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>That’s a complicated question. On the surface, missile defense sounds great – and in some ways it is. Consider, for example, the relatively high rate at which Israel successfully shot down missiles fired by Iran in their war over the summer. However, in the long run, developing these systems can encourage your adversaries to develop technologies that circumvent your defenses, or to develop missile defenses of their own. In the end, you may get a costly arms race that leaves both sides worse off. The United States and the Soviet Union recognized this during the Cold War, which is one reason they agreed to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p><h3>Will the expiring Obama-era nuclear treaty be renegotiated?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: The US and Russia have a nuclear arms treaty that expires in February. New START, negotiated during the Obama administration, limits the size of the countries’ nuclear stockpiles. Will it be renegotiated?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The prospects currently look bleak. As long as there is tension over the war in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine Russia agreeing to a new arms control deal with the United States. If that tension is alleviated, the prospects for a deal would improve.</p><h3>What about China?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Should China or other countries be a part of that process?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN: </strong>Many US policymakers would like to include China as part of an arms control deal with Russia. The problem is that China’s nuclear capabilities currently lag behind Russia and the United States. Countries usually don’t like to negotiate from a position of weakness. As China’s nuclear arsenal expands — a trend that is happening — a trilateral deal becomes more likely, especially if Beijing achieves parity with the other two countries.</p><h3>Bring back the test ban treaty?</h3><p><strong>WOLF: Bill Clinton helped negotiate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the 1990s but failed to get the US Senate to ratify it. Trump isn’t talking about reviving it, but if he could get the handful of nuclear powers that have likewise not ratified the test ban treaty — including China, Russia, North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel — to ratify it, would he be a shoo-in for the Nobel Peace Prize?</strong></p><p><strong>FUHRMANN:</strong> The US Senate vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999 was a setback for global nonproliferation. There are obstacles to bringing the CTBT into force in the current political environment. If the Trump administration was able to get this done, it would be a major foreign policy achievement.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

data-ylk=\"slk:Zohran Mamdani’s base;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Zohran Mamdani’s base</a>.</p><p>CNN’s experts analyzed the pre-election voting data in all three locations, comparing to 2024 in New Jersey and Virginia to better reflect the changes in early voting patterns over the last four years.</p><p>Although early voting analysis can provide hints about which candidates may be well positioned heading into November 4, it is impossible to know who pre-election voters supported or how candidates will do on Election Day, when many of the ballots will be cast.</p><h3>New Jersey: A Democratic turnout advantage</h3><p>In New Jersey, Democrats have turned out at a higher rate than Republican voters in both mail and early in-person voting, putting the Democratic candidate for governor, US Rep. Mikie Sherrill, in a stronger position than Harris was last year at this point. Harris eventually won the state by about 6 points.</p><p>Through the end of Thursday, registered Democrats led registered Republicans in mail ballot returns by over 41 points, a couple of points better than the 39-point gap at this point last year. But unlike last year, Democrats also hold a nearly 2-point lead in in-person early voting. Last year at this time, Democrats trailed in in-person voting by 2 points.</p><p>Mail ballots also represent a larger portion of the pre-election vote so far. As a result, registered Democrats represent a larger share of the total pre-election electorate than they did at this point last year.</p><h3>New York City: Older voters have turned out more; younger voters are catching up</h3><p>Among registered Democrats, a group that will make up the lion’s share of New York City mayoral voters, older voters have turned out more so far than they did during the primary, when strong backing from younger voters helped propel Mamdani to a surprise victory. But the electorate is still younger than in past mayoral elections and has only been getting younger as the week has gone on.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>A CNN analysis of early voting data from the New York City Board of Elections has found that through October 31, about 53% of registered Democratic voters (55% of all voters so far) are ages 50 and up, while almost 16% of Democratic voters are ages 18 to 29 (15% of voters overall).</p><p>That’s more weighted towards older voters than the total Democratic primary electorate, when about 48% were 50 or older and about 18% of voters were 18-29, according to data from L2.</p><p>Polls have shown that younger voters overwhelmingly favor Mamdani, while Cuomo, who is running as an independent, has a smaller lead among older voters.</p><p>This year’s turnout is still younger than the city’s last mayoral election in 2021, when just 9% of voters were ages 18 to 29 and 62% were ages 50 and older.</p><p>Over the course of the week, daily turnout among Democrats has gotten younger: while older voters outnumbered younger ones by about 50 percentage points on the first day of early voting, that dropped below 20 points on the seventh day.</p><p>The geographic distribution of Democratic votes has also been more favorable to Cuomo than it was in the June primary, with turnout strongest so far in precincts where Cuomo did best and relatively weaker in strong Mamdani areas. The most Cuomo-friendly precincts have cast 125% of their primary early in-person totals while the most Mamdani-friendly precincts have cast 85% of their early voting totals.</p><p>Still, if the precinct-level Mamdani vs. Cuomo vote from the primary stayed the same, the changes so far in geographic distribution alone wouldn’t be nearly enough for Cuomo to overtake Mamdani among Democratic early voters.</p><h3>Virginia: Spanberger appears in slightly stronger position</h3><p>While voters don’t register by party in Virginia, the geographic breakdown of votes cast so far suggests Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger is in slightly stronger position heading into the final stretch than Harris was at the same point in last year’s election, when she won Virginia by less than 6 points.</p><p>The geographic distribution of early in-person votes has slightly favored Republicans, while the distribution of mail ballots is similar to what it was at this point last year. But mail ballots, in which Democrats typically perform better, make up a larger share of the pre-election vote this year (24%) than they did at this point last year (21%), resulting in a geographic breakdown of the combined pre-election vote that is more Democratic-leaning relative to the same point in the 2024 election.</p><p>Through Thursday, counties where Trump won last year are averaging 61% of their in-person votes cast at the equivalent point last year, while Harris-won counties are at just over 57%. The worst performing counties so far have been places where Trump won more than 75% of the vote – they’re at just 54% of the in-person votes they’d cast at this point last year.</p><p>And that gap between Trump- and Harris-won counties has been narrowing over the course of the last week, dropping from 10 points to 4 points now, largely coinciding with an increased number of voting locations opening in large Democratic-leaning counties such as <a href=\"https://vote.arlingtonva.gov/Early-Voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Arlington;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Arlington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/early-voting\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fairfax;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Fairfax</a>.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Her Response Changed My Life.</a></strong></p><p>As a parent, I will spend years making decisions about how to protect this child’s autonomy, how to let them express who they are, and how to resist the pressure to force them into boxes that don’t fit. Not finding out the sex is my first chance to practice setting boundaries about how much of my child’s identity I share with the world.</p><p>It’s also my chance to sit with uncertainty, which is something parents of trans kids have to do all the time. Will my child be comfortable in their gender? Will they need support in exploring it? I can’t know those answers yet, and I don’t need to. My job isn’t to have a plan for every possibility — it’s to create the kind of family where every possibility is safe.</p><p>This pregnancy has already been an exercise in acceptance. After months of fertility treatment, I learned over and over that I could not control the outcome — only how I showed up for the process. More than anything, I am just grateful to be pregnant, grateful to get the chance to meet whoever they are.</p><p>The truth is, I don’t need to know the sex of my baby to know they are already a whole person. They are someone who does somersaults after I eat ice cream, tap dances dramatically when I try to fall asleep on my left side, and saves their strongest kicks for the middle of my therapy sessions — almost as if to affirm what’s being said.</p><p>This child is already teaching me patience, flexibility and humility. They are already making me laugh. They are already someone I love fiercely — and none of that depends on the sex printed on an ultrasound report.</p><p>One day, I will meet this baby and learn more about who they are. I will learn what makes them laugh, what soothes them when they cry, and what they notice first when we go outside. And over time, they will reveal themselves to me in ways no ultrasound ever could.</p><p>That, to me, is the real reveal — not a moment at 20 weeks, but a lifetime of getting to know each other.</p><p>I’m not suggesting everyone should make the same choice I did. But I do hope more parents pause before they start writing the story of who their baby will be. Whether or not you find out the sex, you still get to decide how rigidly you cling to gendered expectations.</p><p>You get to decide whether your child’s closet will only be filled with blue onesies and dinosaurs or pink dresses and bows — or whether it will hold a little bit of everything. You get to decide whether you tell them who they are, or let them tell you.</p><p>For me, not finding out the sex is one way of saying:<em> I’m ready to meet you, whoever you are — as you discover that in your own time, and on your own terms. </em></p><p><em>Rebecca Minor, LICSW, is a queer clinician, consultant, and educator specializing in trauma, gender, and sexuality.
