overturning a finding that he was struck by a train.</p><p>A formal inquest by the apartheid government claimed in 1967 that Luthuli -- who in 1960 became the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize --&nbsp;had died after being hit by a goods train while walking on a railway line.</p><p>But activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa&#39;s government this year reopened inquests into the deaths of several political activists in the struggle against the white-minority apartheid regime, which was removed in 1994.</p><p>&quot;It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with&nbsp;an&nbsp;assault,&quot; Judge Nompumelelo Hadebe ruled.</p><p>The judge said Luthuli&#39;s death was attributable to &quot;assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway&nbsp;Company&quot;.</p><p>She set aside the findings of the 1967 inquest and named seven men, whose whereabouts could &quot;not be ascertained&quot;, as having committed or being complicit in the murder.</p><p>They included a locomotive driver, a fireman, a station master and two railway police officers.</p><p>- Calls for justice -</p><p>Luthuli served as president-general of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1952 until his death and led the anti-apartheid movement during one of its most challenging periods, including its banning by the apartheid government.</p><p>During his Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony in Oslo in 1961, he made a passionate plea for non-violence.</p><p>The ANC in a statement Thursday welcomed a &quot;historic judgement&quot; that &quot;corrects a long-standing distortion of history&quot; by recognising that Luthuli was &quot;a victim of state-sanctioned murder&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link

of our struggle whose lives were cut short by the cruelty of apartheid,&quot; the party said.</p><p>Luthuli&#39;s grandson Sandile Luthuli told local television EWN that the family were &quot;elated&quot; with the judgement.</p><p>&quot;The prosecution&#39;s team very meticulously pointed to the institutionalisation of apartheid and the role that those institutions played in the cover-up of the murder of Chief Albert Luthuli,&quot; he said outside the court, indicating they would consider next steps.</p><p>The National Prosecuting Authority announced in April it would reopen inquests into the deaths of Luthuli and another anti-apartheid activist, lawyer Mlungisi Griffiths Mxenge, in an &quot;endeavour to address the atrocities of the past&quot;.</p><p>A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was created in 1996 to expose crimes committed under apartheid. It held 2,500 hearings over two years with the possibility of offering amnesty.</p><p>The process only resulted in a few trials, and rising calls for justice pushed the government to reopen investigations into several cases this year.</p><p>jcb/rlp</p></div></article></div>",

Angeles wildfires at the White House on January 9. - Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview out Thursday, said a frustrating phone call with Joe Biden ahead of her debate with Donald Trump showed her that the former president wasn’t focused on her success – citing it as an example of why she has a “complicated” relationship with Biden.</p><p>“My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself,” she said on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast. “It wasn’t about my performance at the debate.”</p><p>Harris recounted the call, moments before her high-stakes confrontation with Trump, in which Biden told her “a group of people” were speaking poorly of her in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, “because they heard I was saying bad things about him.”</p><p>“I was told that he wanted to call so that I’d be ready,” Harris said. “‘I was so sure it was to buck me up and (say) ‘go get ‘em’ … When I hung up the phone I was just – it was unbelievable, and I was – yes I was angry, and deeply disappointed. It was so unnecessary.”</p><p>The podcast appearance, part of Harris’ media tour promoting her book “107 Days,” marked the former vice president’s latest candid conversation rehashing what happened during her brief and unsuccessful bid for the presidency, as well as the fallout from her loss.</p><p>Harris said she is still friends with Biden, who she said had called her two days earlier for her birthday.</p><p>“I have a great deal of affection for him, and there were times, that I’ve been quite candid about, where he greatly disappointed me and, frankly, angered me,” she said.</p><p>Harris also discussed her perception of Biden’s mental state leading up to his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Trump. Harris said in the interview that she didn’t think Biden actually wanted to hold the early general election debate, but was talked into it.</p><p>“It’s like any competition you go in, whether it’s you’re bidding for something, if it’s sports – you gotta want it, right?” Harris said. “If you don’t want to be in the competition it will absolutely have an impact on your performance, and I don’t think he – I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The former vice president also suggested that she is open to running for president again.</p><p>“I think the case for running again is if I can make a difference,” she said. “If I feel that I can offer something as president of the United States that would be not only uplifting to the American people, but would be about getting us on a correct trajectory.”</p><p>Harris was asked if she thinks she can offer such a message to the country.</p><p>“I mean, that’s why I ran the last time,” she said. “We’ll have to see what happens over the course of these next few months, several months.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

meeting in South Korea with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- their first since 2019, during Trump&#39;s first term -- as &quot;amazing&quot;.</p><p>The two leaders agreed to calm the US-China trade war that has roiled global markets, with Washington cutting some tariffs and Beijing committing to keep supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>But stock markets turned mostly lower after having hit new records in the run-up to the meeting and earnings reports by tech giants.</p><p>&quot;Doubts over the possible returns on investments planned for artificial general intelligence, the Fed’s &#39;hawkish&#39; rate cut and President Trump’s underwhelming trade deal with China have done little to boost sentiment,&quot; said David Morrison, senior market analyst&nbsp;at financial services provider&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Nation.</p><p>US big tech companies were in focus again Thursday, following a mixed reaction to earnings reports from Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft after Wall Street

latest results highlight the business models of the big technology firms are becoming more capital intensive, as they build out their&nbsp;AI&nbsp;capabilities,&quot; said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.</p><p>He added, however, that if AI fails to deliver revenue streams, &quot;the effect on share prices could be brutal.&quot;</p><p>Shares in Nvidia gave up 2.3 percent a day after becoming the first company to reach a $5 trillion market value.</p><p>Seoul&#39;s stock market got a lift from tech giant Samsung Electronics posting a 32 percent rise in on-year profits for the third quarter, driven by AI-fuelled market demand for memory chips.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\"

economy holds up.</p><p>Data on Thursday showed the eurozone economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>The Bank of Japan also held interest rates steady on Thursday, after the US Federal Reserve delivered a second quarter-point rate cut.</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell&#39;s announcement, however, cast doubt on an additional cut in December, jolting US markets and lifting the value of the dollar on Wednesday.</p><p>Advertising giant WPP led losses in London, dropping more than 17 percent after it cut its annual outlook.</p><p>Shares in auto giant Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Fiat and Peugeot, sank&nbsp;over 10 percent despite rising sales as the group said it expects to incur charges in the second half of the year.</p><p>Volkswagen shares fell&nbsp;nearly two percent after its first quarterly loss for five years, topping one billion euros.</p><p>Danish weight-loss drugmaker Novo Nordisk, owner of treatments Wegovy and Ozempic, saw its

recalling some furloughed staff to produce key inflation figures needed for the government to calculate Social Security payments.</p><p>On Thursday, the shutdown entered its 30th day, with Republicans

We ended up turning the lionfish into leather, and that was the genesis of this wonderful idea.

However, it soon escaped into the wild: “In the Mississippi river ecosystem it’s completely decimating native biodiversity,” Chavda said. “It consumes an unbelievable amount of native vegetation and biomass and it’s now in several US states — it’s a major problem.”</p><p>The Burmese python soon followed: “It’s a constrictor snake originally from Southeast Asia, which was released into the Florida Everglades in the 1990s,” Chavda said. The snakes, likely from the pet trade, quickly multiplied and turned into super-predators, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/blog/florida-vs-the-burmese-python-how-an-invasive-giant-is-changing-the-sunshine-state/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:collapse;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">collapse</a> of the populations of native mammals like raccoons, opossums and bobcats.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A Burmese python in the Everglades, Florida in April 2019.

The system is managed through a digital platform called Origin, which integrates real-time field data, satellite imagery, predictive modeling, and AI-driven invasion mapping, with the goal of streamlining the operation and allowing traceability of every product: “Invasive species are a 21st century ecological crisis whose management cannot be solved with outdated, fragmented approaches,” Chavda said.</p><p>“We are building a completely transparent, traceable and verifiable supply chain, all the way back to the hunting itself.”</p><p>Chavda noted the tanning process is different from using cow hide — especially for fish skin, which is made up of very thin but also very strong fibers.</p><p>He added that Inversa is working with about 50 fashion brands and will soon expand into even more species, which he plans to announce next year. The company mandates that the final products mention either its name or the fact that the leather is sourced from an invasive species, and it states that this method of leather production offers an 89% improvement on carbon emissions and brings land use to almost zero.</p><p>Inversa said that it adheres to humane killing practices and is backed by American nonprofit environmental organization <a href=\"https://www.conservation.org/projects/conservation-international-ventures-llc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Conservation International;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Conservation International </a>and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EkTaS1GnYss7YvVQTQxTEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e7d0bba7f9b809bcdb9815899a66ca20><noscript><img alt=\"These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EkTaS1GnYss7YvVQTQxTEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/e7d0bba7f9b809bcdb9815899a66ca20 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>These Gabriela Hearst shoes are made with black Inversa python leather. - Gabriela Hearst</figcaption></div></figure><p>Chavda said Inversa has removed tens of thousands of invasive animals. However, there is no definitive assessment on the effect of these removals on the habitats: “In the Everglades, we’re seeing anecdotal increases in native mammals in the areas we’re hitting hard, from our hunters. We can definitely tell that the alleviated pressure is helping.”</p><p>Inversa’s work was assessed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Switzerland, which found it had a positive impact on biodiversity.</p><p>“Despite contributing to 60% of species extinctions and causing $423 billion in economic damages annually, invasive species remain largely overlooked in conservation funding,” said Sybille Borner of WWF Switzerland. “The (assessment) highlights Inversa’s ability to fill parts of this critical gap, demonstrating how fashion can be an unexpected yet powerful force for biodiversity.”</p><h3>Raising awareness</h3><p>Alexandra Ioanid, an associate professor at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest, Romania, who has done <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15589250251329539\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">research</a> on invasive species and is not involved with Inversa, said that turning invasive species into a valuable material addresses two challenges at once: “It helps reduce the ecological damage caused by species that threaten native ecosystems, and it offers a more sustainable alternative to conventional leather. Technically, it’s exciting to see that leather made from invasive species can reach the quality and versatility required for real-world use.”</p><p>With the right tanning methods, Ioanid added, these alternative leathers can perform on par with traditional materials — and have a distinctive texture and aesthetic of their own: “If done responsibly, such initiatives can create economic incentives for removing invasive species, support local livelihoods, and contribute to conservation goals. The key is maintaining traceability and ecological oversight to ensure that these materials genuinely help manage invasives rather than encouraging new harvesting.”</p><p>However, selling materials sourced from wildlife, non-native or not, can stimulate markets that promote unrestricted or incentivized killing, encourage intensive wildlife farming and trigger unintended consequences, such as the deliberate release of these species to sustain supply, according to PJ Smith, fashion policy director for Humane World for Animals, a nonprofit that fights animal cruelty.</p><p>“Wildlife conservation efforts should prioritize the development of effective nonlethal management strategies that provide long-term solutions to address negative impacts from non-native species over fueling demand for luxury goods. There is a growing consumer demand for true, sustainable, bio-based leather alternatives that are animal-free and help restore ecosystems without the exploitation,” Smith added.</p><p>Deah Lieurance, an assistant professor of Invasive Species Biology and Management at Penn State University, said that the populations of invasive species that Inversa harvests are so high that she’s doubtful the company could have any significant impact on restoration: “I do think these types of projects do have one major benefit,” she added, “they bring greater public awareness to the wicked problem of biological invasion.”</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.</p><p>Cuomo <a

to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.</p><p>Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-preparations?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani</a>.

The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>And in a <a href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/nyc-mayors-race-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters</a> released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 18%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.</p><p>With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23><noscript><img alt=\"Voters cast their ballots during New York&#39;s early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York&#39;s Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/twSdJfhtp9yjY55YvJCUPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9be43575ef68788fb956644ac9c5ad23 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Voters cast their ballots during New York's early voting period, at a polling station in the Brooklyn Museum in New York's Brooklyn borough on October 25. - Angelina Katsanis/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.</p><p>“We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”</p><p>Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.</p><p>The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).</p><p>Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.</p><p>In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:laughed with a radio host;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">laughed with a radio host</a> who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11.

In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.</p><p>“I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/politics/andrew-cuomo-resigns?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cuomo resigned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Cuomo resigned</a> in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.</p><p>He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep.

Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”</p><h3>Embracing his inner influencer</h3><p>As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.</p><p>Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.</p><p>“It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.</p><p>Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.</p><p>“He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571><noscript><img alt=\"New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OKjR.Av8lvAcPYQUwkfjjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/9ed3a14f289bb5bd952326f4e2c37571 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>New York mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks during a campaign event at a senior center in The Bronx on Tuesday. - Seth Wenig/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.</p><p>At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.</p><h3>Experience, experience, experience</h3><p>Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.</p><p>Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-police-nypd-defund?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mamdani’s police reform agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Mamdani’s police reform agenda</a> would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.</p><p>The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.</p><p>On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.</p><p>“You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.</p><p>On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.</p><p>Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.</p><p>“Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”</p><p>CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.</p><p>Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment.</p><h3>Injuries were devastating</h3><p>The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.</p><p>After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.</p><p>A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.</p><p>Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.</p><p>In another emotional courtroom moment in December 2023, Zwerner read a statement during the sentencing of the student’s mother on charges related to the shooting.</p><p>“The boy pointed the gun directly at me and shot. The single bullet went through my left hand and lodged into my upper left chest, leaving traces of bullet fragments in both areas that will remain forever,” Zwerner said at the time.</p><p>“When this happened and emergency responders worked to keep me alive, I was not sure whether it would be my final moment on earth.”</p><h3>School official is only defendant</h3><p>Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit filed months after the shooting. A judge previously dismissed the other original defendants, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>The student’s mother was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/us/virgina-teacher-mother-shooting-sentenced?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:sentenced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">sentenced</a> to a total of nearly four years in prison for  child neglect and federal weapons charges.</p><p>The boy was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/newport-news-virginia-school-shooting-no-charges?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:not charged;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">not charged</a> with any wrongdoing.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758><noscript><img alt=\"Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6syIe86zY4zzOinYXvP_jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/51cc3e8b197dbbb184bddcb5fbaa4758 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Police tape hangs from a sign post outside Richneck Elementary School following a shooting on January 7, 2023 in Newport News, Virginia. - Jay Paul/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/22/us/newport-news-virginia-teacher-shooting-gun-closet?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously told CNN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">previously told CNN</a>.</p><p>However, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/us/virginia-teacher-shooting-mother-guilty?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:later said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">later said</a> authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock.

They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.</p><p>A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.</p><p>And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/snap-benefits-food-stamps-explainer?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</a></p><p>The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare.

But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.</p><p>Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their mortgages and other obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.</p><h3>Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?</h3><p>Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.</p><p>The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.</p><p>The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.</p><p>As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.</p><p>► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?</p><p>► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?</p><p>► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.2ZjBKz.kyX_AIB1KrY79Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3a8c1e9a5fcb1449dbb7fe0d998d6f8a><noscript><img alt=\"Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.2ZjBKz.kyX_AIB1KrY79Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/3a8c1e9a5fcb1449dbb7fe0d998d6f8a class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer holds a news conference with fellow Senate Democrats to highlight the dangers of SNAP and WIC benefits ending during the federal government shutdown on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><h3>A hint of hope as senators talk</h3><p>A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators</a>. One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.</p><p>Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.</p><p>A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”</p><p>Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”</p><p>The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.</p><p>The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.</p><p>Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.</p><p>But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/democrats-afge-union-shutdown?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:American Federation of Government Employees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">American Federation of Government Employees</a> union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cBHJE6Mm.lZU_cV8DlDGng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f272ef5a447ba10747dd6337e9cb8254><noscript><img alt=\"House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cBHJE6Mm.lZU_cV8DlDGng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f272ef5a447ba10747dd6337e9cb8254 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>House Speaker Mike Johnson walks through Statuary Hall on his way to a news conference on the 29th day of the federal government shutdown at the Capitol on Wednesday in Washington, DC. - Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”</p><p>Republicans face their own risks.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-mike-johnson-shutdown-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Georgia Rep.

about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.</p><p>He’s just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!</p><p>“Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/10/no-trump-isnt-destroying-the-white-house/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:National Review wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">National Review wrote</a>.</p><p>The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/25/ballroom-east-wing-trump-white-house/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere</a>.”</p><p>Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.</p><p>In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those who dislike Trump that are objecting.</p><p>New <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/939641649/Yahoo-YouGov-Ballroom-Poll-October-2025\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Yahoo News-YouGov;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Yahoo News-YouGov</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/30/trump-east-wing-demolition-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Post-ABC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Washington Post-ABC News</a> polls are the first quality surveys to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. And both show similar things.</p><p>The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.</p><p>The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.</p><p>Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.</p><p>For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.</p><p>Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.</p><p>In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>So this <em>does</em> appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.</p><p>None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.</p><p>An important question from there is why people disapprove.</p><p>Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:won’t interfere with the current building;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">won’t interfere with the current building</a>,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)</p><p>All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.</p><p>While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).</p><p>That’s a little counter intuitive.</p><p>The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.</p><p>What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.</p><p>Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/oval-office-gold-decor-trump?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:gilded the interior of the White House;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">gilded the interior of the White House</a>. He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/video/trump-gold-crown-south-korea-gift-digvid?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:like a golden crown from South Korea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">like a golden crown from South Korea</a>.</p><p>There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/08/most-americans-think-trump-is-trying-to-exercise-more-power-than-previous-presidents/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pew Research Center poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Pew Research Center poll</a> conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-shutdown-trump-democrats-republicans/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CBS News-YouGov poll;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CBS News-YouGov poll</a> around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”</p><p>In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
