used false pretenses to enter a campus residential building – has been released, she confirmed on her Instagram account.</p><p>At approximately 6:30 a.m., agents from the Department of Homeland Security entered a Columbia residential building in New York City and took a student into custody, Columbia University’s Acting President Claire Shipman said <a

federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a ‘missing person,’” Shipman wrote. “We are working to gather more details.”</p><p>The student has been identified as Aghayeva, an international student and senior double majoring in neuroscience and political science, according to the American Association of University Professors, which confirmed her identity to CNN. AAUP learned of Aghayeva’s identity when her fellow students alerted the Columbia University AAUP chapter.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security confirmed to CNN that ICE arrested Aghayeva, but did not respond to allegations that agents misrepresented themselves to gain access to the building.</p><p>ICE arrested Aghayeva, who is from Azerbaijan, “whose student visa was terminated in 2016 under the Obama administration for failing to attend classes,” the statement read.</p><p>“The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment. She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS.”</p><p>Aghayeva <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/ellharve\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:shared a story on Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">shared a story on Instagram</a> showing a photo of just her legs with the caption: “DHS illegally arrested me.

An administrative warrant, she wrote, is not sufficient.</p><p>“If law enforcement agents seek entry to non-public areas of the University, ask the agents to wait to enter any non-public areas until contacting Public Safety. Public Safety will contact the Office of the General Counsel to coordinate the University’s response,” Shipman wrote.</p><p>“Do not allow them to enter or accept service of a warrant or subpoena.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/26/politics/trump-mamdani-meet-washington-white-house?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:President Donald Trump met Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">President Donald Trump met Thursday</a> with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani in Washington to discuss housing.

Many thousands are still missing or unidentified,&quot; Turk said.</p><p>There have been no official figures on the conflict&#39;s overall death toll.</p><p>Turk condemned what he called the &quot;heinous and ruthless&quot; brutalities committed, including sexual violence, summary executions and arbitrary detentions.</p><p>He highlighted the &quot;carnage&quot; inflicted by the RSF in an April attack on the Zamzam displacement camp and again in October in El‑Fasher, then the regular army&#39;s last foothold in western Darfur.</p><p>Rape, gang rape, sexual torture and slavery have also surged, Turk said, with more than 500 victims documented in 2025. &quot;The bodies of Sudanese women and girls have been weaponised to terrorise communities.&quot;</p><p>In a statement, the foreign ministers of the Sudan core group at the UN Human Rights Council said the RSF-led violence in El-Fasher &quot;constitutes war crimes and crimes against humanity and bears the hallmarks of genocide&quot;.</p><p>Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Britain said they would form a coalition &quot;to prevent further atrocities in Sudan and support the Sudanese people in laying the foundations for future justice&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Madness&#39; -</p><p>Since the fall of El-Fasher, the fighting has moved deeper into neighbouring Kordofan where drone strikes have killed dozens at a time.</p><p>Since January, drone attacks in the southern Kordofan region and beyond have &quot;killed or injured nearly 600 civilians&quot;, Turk said, including in attacks on humanitarian aid convoys.</p><p>The UN&#39;s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Sudan, Denise Brown, said that access to the cities of Kadugli and Dilling in South Kordofan -- long cut off by an RSF siege until the army recently lifted it -- had been effectively impossible.</p><p>&quot;We were not able to get supplies in. We had to remove our staff for their own safety,&quot; she said Thursday, after stepping off the first UN flight to Khartoum since the war began.</p><p>Famine was declared last November in the North Darfur capital El-Fasher and in Kadugli, the capital of South Kordofan, according to a UN-backed assessment. The same assessment said Dilling in South Kordofan is likely facing famine conditions.</p><p>Turk said the army and the RSF continued to use &quot;explosive weapons in densely populated areas, often without warning -- showing utter disregard for human life&quot;.</p><p>He highlighted the &quot;increased use of advanced long-range drones&quot;, which has &quot;expanded harm to civilians in areas far from the front lines that were previously peaceful&quot;.</p><p>Turk also voiced concern over &quot;the growing militarisation of society&quot;, including the recruitment of children into the fighting.</p><p>Several countries have been accused of involvement in the conflict.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates has been accused of arming the RSF -- allegations it denies.&nbsp;Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have backed army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.</p><p>Turk urged &quot;diplomatic and political pressure&quot; for a humanitarian truce that leads to a permanent ceasefire.</p><p>Efforts to secure a ceasefire have repeatedly collapsed.</p><p>Burhan vowed this week to fight &quot;until the end&quot; and said he plans to build a &quot;smart army&quot; investing in technology and research.</p><p>In January, the army was studying a new ceasefire proposal from the United States and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Talks mediated by the United States, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have stalled for months, with Burhan accusing mediators of favouring the UAE.</p><p>bur-maf/tw</p></div></article></div>",

Some money in the most recent release went to two tribes in California, but not the state itself.</p><p>“This week, FEMA released over $5 billion in recovery funding for projects, some dating back as far as 15 years — a significant win for states, local governments, and hospitals,” a FEMA spokesperson said. “To be clear, this is about results, not politics.”</p><p>“Regarding which projects are being funded, FEMA is prioritizing based on project readiness and strict oversight. Obligations are made when projects meet all necessary criteria. Decisions are not based on political considerations; the process is focused on merit and accountability,” the spokesperson added.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"The Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, DC, on February 13. - Michael M.

Aires but sparked protests and a legal challenge in Europe.</p><p>Argentine senators voted 69-3 in favor of the agreement to create one of the world&#39;s biggest free trade zones, sealing its adoption days after it passed the lower house.</p><p>Hours earlier, neighboring Uruguay was first out of the blocks to ratify the deal, which has been fiercely opposed by farmers in some EU countries.</p><p>It still requires approval from lawmakers in the European Parliament, which referred it to the EU&#39;s top court within days of being inked in January.</p><p>The deal between the EU and the four founding members of the Mercosur bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- was a quarter century in the making.</p><p>Argentine President Javier Milei, a free market champion, hailed the ratification of the accord.</p><p>&quot;Openness = prosperity,&quot; Milei wrote on X.</p><p>In a later statement he said the agreement was a chance to promote economic development and attract investment and expressed hope that Brazil and Paraguay would quickly adopt it also.</p><p>It eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of trade between the two blocs, which together account for 30 percent of global GDP and more than 700 million consumers.</p><p>The two sides have yet to agree on export quotas.</p><p>The South Americans have moved to quickly enshrine it in their legislation, in an apparent bid to pressure Brussels to follow suit.</p><p>In Brazil, the lower house of parliament backed it by a large majority on Wednesday.</p><p>The accord, which was energetically promoted by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as well as the leaders of Germany and Spain, aims to boost EU exports of vehicles, machinery and wines and spirits.</p><p>In return, South American producers of beef, sugar, rice, honey and soybeans gain easier access to one of the world&#39;s largest economies.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

MOHAMMED)</figcaption></div></figure><p>The tech-rich Nasdaq was back in retreat Thursday as lingering worries over the artificial intelligence boom overshadowed strong Nvidia results while leading bourses in Asia and Europe hit fresh records.</p><p>All eyes had been on chip giant Nvidia, which reported Wednesday night that quarterly profits more than doubled to $43 billion as it projected more strong growth for the coming period.</p><p>While trading in Nvidia was initially volatile, investors ultimately turned on the stock, leaving it down 5.5 percent at the end of Thursday&#39;s session.</p><p>&quot;It says a lot when a stock market darling beating revenue forecasts by billions of dollars can no longer muster a positive share price reaction,&quot; said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.</p><p>&quot;The mood music is changing on&nbsp;Nvidia, and it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment,&quot; he added.</p><p>The results come at a brittle moment for tech equities, which have suffered intermittent rounds of selling in recent days as markets weigh worries about whether massive capital spending on AI will prove profitable and the risk that incumbent technology companies could suffer.</p><p>Nvidia&#39;s &quot;results by themselves were good, but&nbsp;we have to keep in mind that hyperscalers are spending way more than they&#39;re bringing in,&quot; said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital Management.</p><p>Investors are worried because slowing spending will &quot;impact everyone along the chain,&quot; Ablin said. &quot;And Nvidia is obviously a big beneficiary of all that spending.&quot;</p><p>While the Dow eked out a tiny gain, the Nasdaq finished down 1.2 percent, snapping a two-day rally in which worries about AI appeared to recede.</p><p>Meanwhile, major European indices advanced.</p><p>London set a fresh record, boosted by a&nbsp;4.5 percent rise in Rolls-Royce shares after the British engine-maker upgraded its guidance, announced a share buyback and posted soaring annual profits.</p><p>Paris&#39;s CAC 40 index crossed the 8,600 level for the first time and Frankfurt also rose.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

The Kospi index is now up nearly 50 percent already this year.</p><p>On currency markets, the yen clawed back some losses against the dollar that came after it emerged that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had nominated two academics to the Bank of Japan board who are considered policy doves.</p><p>That came after earlier reports had said she had told the central bank&#39;s boss Kazuo Ueda of her concern about hiking interest rates further.</p><p>Among individual companies, shares in multinational automaker Stellantis, which makes brands such as Jeep and Fiat, climbed&nbsp;six percent as trading got underway in New York.</p><p>The company posted a net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion) for last year, but it was mostly due to write-downs of assets as the carmaker shifts away from electric vehicles.</p><p>- Key figures at around 2115 GMT -</p><p>New York - Dow: UP less than 0.1 percent at 49,499.20 (close)</p><p>New York - S&amp;P 500: DOWN 0.5 percent at 6,908.86 (close)</p><p>New York - Nasdaq Composite: DOWN 1.2 percent at 22,878.38 (close)</p><p>London - FTSE 100: UP 0.4&nbsp;percent at 10,846.70 (close)</p><p>Paris - CAC 40: UP 0.7&nbsp;percent&nbsp;at 8,620.93 (close)</p><p>Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.4 percent at 25,289.02 (close)</p><p>Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 58,753.39 (close)</p><p>Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: DOWN 1.4 percent at 26,381.02 (close)</p><p>Shanghai - Composite: FLAT at 4,146.63 (close)</p><p>Dollar/yen: DOWN at 156.11 yen from 156.37 yen on Wednesday</p><p>Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1799 from $1.1810</p><p>Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.3489 from $1.3559</p><p>Euro/pound: UP at 87.47 pence from 87.10 pence</p><p>West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 0.3 percent at $65.21 per barrel</p><p>Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.1&nbsp;percent at $70.75 per barrel</p><p>burs-jmb/ksb</p></div></article></div>",

Perhaps because of the below.</p><h3>The administration’s sudden reversal on the files</h3><p>Prominent officials who now serve in Trump’s Justice Department had for years promoted theories about a government cover-up involving Epstein. After Trump’s election in 2024, they promised major disclosures.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But then they came into office.</p><p>They soon tried to pass off <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/media/epstein-files-conspiracy-bondi?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:binders of largely old documents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">binders of largely old documents</a> given to right-wing influencers as those major disclosures.</p><p>Then some officials suddenly changed their tune on what the documents showed, downplaying the prospect of a client list and saying Epstein had in fact killed himself. Eventually, they <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/07/politics/bondi-epstein-files-client-list-suicide-memo?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:abruptly announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">abruptly announced</a> in July, in an unsigned memo from the FBI, that they wouldn’t release anything else.</p><p>Then we learned that sudden change in tune <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/politics/trump-epstein-files-pivot-timeline?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:coincided with Trump being told his name appeared;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">coincided with Trump being told his name appeared</a> in the Epstein files.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein (left) and Donald Trump pose at Mar-a-Lago on February 22, 1997. - Davidoff Studios Photography/Archive Photos/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ju4RcmO_nyfW9X3hfjB0ow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/fceedac4c0bef9cc5dad8fc156238cc0><noscript><img alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein (left) and Donald Trump pose at Mar-a-Lago on February 22, 1997. - Davidoff Studios Photography/Archive Photos/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ju4RcmO_nyfW9X3hfjB0ow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/fceedac4c0bef9cc5dad8fc156238cc0 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Jeffrey Epstein (left) and Donald Trump pose at Mar-a-Lago on February 22, 1997. - Davidoff Studios Photography/Archive Photos/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Eventually, the administration consented to releasing the Epstein files — but only after it was clear they probably had no other choice. Congress had well more than veto-proof majorities to force the issue.</p><h3>Trump’s questionable denials</h3><p>Speaking of Trump’s name being in the files, that’s one of several instances of him downplaying his proximity to Epstein using claims that were subsequently undermined or called into question:</p><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p>Trump in July denied being told his name was in the files, shortly before we found out Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/bondi-trump-epstein-list-files?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:had indeed told him that;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">had indeed told him that</a> back in May.</p></li><li><p>In 2019, he said that he “wasn’t a fan” of Epstein’s and added, “I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him.” In fact, lots of evidence has suggested they were friendly before their falling out, including archived video footage and photos of them together uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/22/politics/kfile-trump-epstein-photos-footage?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN’s KFile;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN’s KFile</a>.

While we don’t have proof that Trump authored the letter, the claims they used to deny it <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/politics/trump-epstein-letter-signature?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:seemed to fall apart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">seemed to fall apart</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trump in July seemed to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/politics/virginia-giuffre-trump-epstein?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:reluctantly acknowledge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">reluctantly acknowledge</a> he had known that Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell recruited their victim, Virginia Giuffre, from Mar-a-Lago. Trump previously avoided discussing why he and Epstein had a falling out, including saying in 2019: “The reason doesn’t make any difference, frankly.”</p></li><li><p>We then learned recently that Trump told a local police chief when Epstein was first under investigation in the mid-2000s that “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/10/politics/donald-trump-police-jeffrey-epstein-2000?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:everyone has known he’s been doing this;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">everyone has known he’s been doing this</a>.”</p></li></ul><p>There have been other data points at least gesturing in the direction that Trump knew Epstein <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/politics/virginia-giuffre-trump-epstein?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:liked young women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">liked young women</a>. But what he told local Florida police is perhaps the most compelling evidence yet that Trump knew something about Epstein’s crimes way back when.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she couldn’t confirm whether that conversation happened. She added that if it did, it “corroborates” Trump having called Epstein a “creep” and broken ties with him. But Trump has never been forthcoming about why he decided Epstein was a creep.</p><h3>The Maxwell prison transfer</h3><p>Shortly after she interviewed with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last summer, Maxwell was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-federal-prison-texas?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:moved to a minimum-security prison camp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">moved to a minimum-security prison camp</a>.</p><p>You begin to see how that might look bad. Maxwell, after all, is a convicted sex offender. She was also saying things <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/25/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-epstein-doj?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:that could help Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">that could help Trump</a> — even as he dangled a potential pardon.</p><p>But the administration spent months not explaining why the transfer occurred.</p><p>Eventually Blanche <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/21/todd-blanche-defends-moving-ghislaine-maxwell-00702240\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:told NBC News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">told NBC News</a> shortly before Christmas that the Bureau of Prisons recommended the transfer, and he suggested he had signed off on it.
