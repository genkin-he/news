than $100,000 in trading cards.</p><p>The January heist in New York was the latest in a string of thefts targeting collectors of Pokemon, the Japanese media franchise that marks its 30th anniversary on Friday.</p><p>Pokemon cards, bearing &quot;little monsters&quot; that attract children as well as adult superfans, have soared in value in recent years.</p><p>US influencer Logan Paul this month set a new world record by banking $16.5 million with his sale of a rare Pikachu card -- arguably the most iconic Pokemon character.</p><p>But high prices have attracted criminals keen to cash in.</p><p>Pokemon cards &quot;are high value in a small footprint, demand is broad and consistent, and the resale ecosystem is large,&quot; said Nick Jarman, founder and CEO of the Certified Trading Card Association.</p><p>&quot;That combination means stolen product can move quickly -- sometimes across state lines -- through a mix of online marketplaces, card shows, and informal buyer networks,&quot; he told AFP.</p><p>- &#39;Big target&#39; -</p><p>The New York robbery, which police are yet to solve, was not an isolated incident.</p><p>Thieves in California made off this month with about $180,000 worth of Pokemon trading cards after drilling through a wall to access a store.</p><p>&quot;We got a big target on our back in this trading card, collectible world now,&quot; owner Duy Pham told CBS News after the burglary.</p><p>It was the second time in less than a year that his shop was robbed.</p><p>Similar thefts have also been reported in Japan, Britain, Canada and Australia.</p><p>&quot;In some cases, incidents appear opportunistic, smash-and-grab, while others look more targeted -- suggesting prior knowledge of store layouts, closing routines, or where higher-value inventory is kept,&quot; Jarman said.</p><p>He noted that many shops operate on thin margins, so boosting security measures can be a financial burden.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

14, 2026. - Johannes Simon/Getty Images/File</figcaption></div></figure><p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remained defiant that she has no information regarding the criminal activities of the late Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>“Like every decent person, I have been horrified by what we have learned about their crimes,” Clinton said of Epstein and Maxwell in her opening remarks Thursday to House lawmakers. “It’s unfathomable that Mr. Epstein initially got a slap on the wrist in 2008, which allowed him to continue his predatory practices for another decade.”</p><p>Clinton is sitting for a deposition in New York, near where she lives with former President Bill Clinton, as part of the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into Epstein. The interview, underway behind closed doors, is the culmination of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/03/politics/clintons-depositions-epstein-contempt?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a vigorous fight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">a vigorous fight</a> by both Clinton and her husband over testifying in what they denounced as a Republican plot against them.</p><p>Clinton has said she cannot recall ever meeting Epstein and only interacted with his former associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, a handful of times.</p><p>“The Committee justified its subpoena to me based on its assumption that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Let me be as clear as i can. I do not,” Clinton said in the remarks, which she posted publicly. “I had no idea about their criminal activities. I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes or offices. I have nothing to add to that.”</p><p>Republicans, however, insist her testimony is vital to their probe, while Democrats have argued their colleagues’ fixation on the former secretary of state is purely political.</p><p>The Clintons only agreed to comply with their subpoenas for closed-door depositions after the House had moved toward a bipartisan vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to appear as scheduled.</p><p>The former secretary of state was accompanied by her attorneys, who have been working through painstaking details of what areas could be covered during questioning.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>The location for the depositions, the Clintons’ hometown of Chappaqua, was negotiated between Kendall and Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, in hopes of avoiding the indignity and precedent-setting move of summoning a former president to Capitol Hill for questioning.</p><p>The former first lady arrived out of direct sight of the gaggle of reporters who had gathered in front of the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center. But two images of Clinton flanked by her attorneys surfaced on social media during the proceeding – prompting cries of lawmakers running afoul House rules and a brief pause in the deposition.</p><p>The Clintons have repeatedly called for their closed-door depositions to be public, which Comer declined – a point the former secretary of state criticized to open the interview.</p><p>“You have held zero public hearings, refused to allow the media to attend them, including today, despite espousing the need for transparency on dozens of occasions,” she said.</p><p>To prepare for Thursday’s deposition – and the former president’s set for a day later, the Clintons in recent days <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/how-bill-hillary-clinton-are-preparing-depositions-jeffrey-epstein?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:have hunkered down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">have hunkered down</a> to not only refresh their memories about the Epstein years, but to prepare to counter potentially hostile congressional investigators.

And obviously we moved to hold the Clintons in contempt. And I think one thing that surprised the Clintons, they assumed that Democrats on the committee would vote in a partisan manner and not vote to hold the Clintons in contempt, and what they learned was a majority of Democrats on the committee either voted to hold the Clintons to contempt or voted present,” Comer said ahead of the interview Thursday.</p><p>“I think that’s a statement that this investigation is serious. It is a bipartisan investigation. The American people have a lot of questions. To my knowledge, the Clintons haven’t answered very many if any questions about their knowledge or involvement with Epstein and Maxwell,” he added.</p><p>The Clintons and members of the House Oversight Committee have agreed to five topic areas for the depositions, a person familiar with the agreement told CNN. They are:</p><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p>alleged mismanagement of the federal government’s investigation into Epstein and Maxwell;</p></li><li><p>the circumstances and subsequent investigations of Epstein’s 2019 death;</p></li><li><p>the ways the federal government could effectively combat sex-trafficking rings;</p></li><li><p>how Epstein and Maxwell sought to curry favor to protect their illegal activities;</p></li><li><p>and potential violations of ethics rules related to elected officials.</p></li></ul><p>Initially, the Clintons wanted their subpoenas for depositions to be waived for sworn statements under oath, an accommodation that Comer granted to several other witnesses in the investigation. But the Oversight Committee chairman wanted them to appear on his terms.</p><p>Clinton attorneys and the Republican-led panel negotiated behind the scenes for months, through email exchanges, letters and phone calls to try and find an off-ramp.</p><p>The Clintons argued that they were being unfairly targeted and have criticized Republicans for not holding other individuals like President Donald Trump, whose name appears countless times in the Epstein files, to the same standard.</p><p>“If this Committee is serious about learning the truth about Epstein’s trafficking crimes, it would not rely on press gaggles to get answers from our current president on his involvement; it would ask him directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files,” Clinton said in her prepared remarks to lawmakers. “What is being held back? Who is being protected? And why the cover-up?”</p><p>Comer has argued that the investigation is bipartisan and pointed to the depositions of former Republican Attorney General Bill Barr and former US Attorney Alex Acosta who granted Epstein his sweetheart plea deal in 2008. Comer added that he is open to bringing in Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, for questioning given his ties to Epstein as well.</p><p>“It is a bipartisan investigation. The American people have a lot of questions. To my knowledge, the Clintons haven’t answered very many if any questions about their knowledge or involvement with Epstein and Maxwell,” the Kentucky Republican said.</p><p>When the Clintons did not appear for their scheduled depositions in January, Comer scheduled a vote to hold the pair in criminal contempt.</p><p>Triple the number of Democrats ultimately voted to hold the former president in contempt compared to the former first lady, but the bipartisan votes took House Democratic leadership by surprise.</p><p>Bill Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and a spokesperson has repeatedly said he cut ties before Epstein’s arrest on federal charges in 2019 and was unaware of any crimes.</p><p>A CNN review showed the former president traveled on Epstein’s private plane at least 16 times, and he was pictured in Epstein case files released by the Justice Department with women in a jacuzzi, as well as with Maxwell.</p><p>Survivors of Epstein’s abuse and lawyers representing them told CNN that they believe it is important for the Clintons, and especially the former president, to testify. In interviews, they stressed that the presence of an individual in the Epstein files and their cooperation with Congress does not indicate wrongdoing.</p><p>The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, said he wants to speak to anyone who has knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, regardless of party.</p><p>“We will talk to any single person, whether that is a Democrat, a Republican, how much wealth they have, how powerful their position is, we want to talk to anyone so we’re happy to be here and we’re glad both Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton are willing to talk to this committee,” he told reporters.</p><p>But Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw expressed concern that Republicans only wanted to speak with Clinton for political reasons.</p><p>“My fear is we are here today as part of a political exercise, part of a long running fever-dream where Republicans want to lock up Secretary Clinton,” Walkinshaw said. “I wanted to come today to ensure that this is a serious exercise, a serious investigation, and not a political, partisan one.”</p><p>In the current political environment, victims of Epstein hold far more sway with many Democratic lawmakers than a sense of loyalty to the Clintons. More than 40 current House Democrats were born in 1980 or later, giving them different memories of Bill Clinton’s presidency than party leaders who were in Washington when he ended 12 years of Republican control of the White House.</p><p><em>This story has been updated with additional developments.</em></p><p>CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Such a charter would allow the company ‌to expand its business operations.</p><p>Warren, who ⁠along with other Democrats raised concerns that the application presents a potential conflict of interest, said she wanted Gould to share an ⁠unredacted copy of the application with her and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, a Republican, to ensure it includes all necessary information.</p><p>Warren and several other Democrats on the Committee ​also pressed ​Gould to reject or delay reviewing the ​application.

killing of the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) by Mexican authorities on Sunday sparked widespread violence, with gang members opening fire on soldiers and setting up burning roadblocks in various parts of the country.</p><p>The killing of Nemesio Oseguera, also known as &quot;El Mencho,&quot; constituted a victory for the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum.</p><p>Experts now warn that the true challenge is whether she can contain the inevitable fighting as the CJNG enters into a war over control of one of Mexico&#39;s largest criminal groups.</p><p>Elite Mexican soldiers supported by US intelligence agencies killed Oseguera on Sunday in Tapalpa, in the western state of Jalisco, where he was wounded while trying to flee. He died while en route to the hospital.</p><p>Experts say the cartel&#39;s response -- gunbattles, highway blockades, and the burning of cars, businesses, and banks in 20 out of Mexico&#39;s 32 states -- was not just revenge for the death of their leader.</p><p>It was a show of force.</p><p>- What can the cartel do? -</p><p>The cartel will have to fill the void left by &quot;El Mencho,&quot; who managed the organization of more than 30,000 members with a vertical command structure and an iron fist, according to academic experts.</p><p>For Raul Benitez Manaut, a national security expert, the question is whether there will be an agreed-upon transition of power between the second-tier hierarchy of the cartel, or whether Sunday&#39;s violence will unleash a far larger internal war.</p><p>If the criminal organization carries out more choreographed acts like they did on Sunday, they will put the Mexican government and security forces in &quot;far more awkward situations.&quot;</p><p>- Who will succeed &#39;El Mencho&#39;? -</p><p>Oseguera&#39;s power within the CJNG was so established that many believe he could have named his successor to ensure the cohesion of the cartel.</p><p>In 2025, the US Treasury Department said that Julio Alberto Castillo Rodriguez, the son-in-law of &quot;El Mencho,&quot; was &quot;considered a possible successor to Oseguera.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Working through the industrial Pacific coast port of Manzanillo, Castillo has facilitated the entrance of precursor chemicals the cartel uses to produce fentanyl and other illicit drugs that are trafficked to the United States, the Treasury Department said at the time in a communique.</p><p>- Can the government contain the violence? -</p><p>The organization&#39;s violent response to the killing of its leader provoked widespread terror among the Mexican population.</p><p>&quot;It was about sending a message to the Mexican government and rival cartels, saying &#39;we&#39;re still powerful, we&#39;re still strong,&#39;&quot; Mike Vigil, a former DEA agent, said.</p><p>They are warning that the killing of &quot;El Mencho&quot; will not weaken them, threatening their enemies to keep them from taking over their drug trafficking routes and territories, he added.</p><p>The government has been &quot;taking precautions&quot; by deploying thousands of soldiers to Jalisco and other states, according to the ex-DEA agent, who believes the Mexican military has the situation under control.</p><p>Manaut, the national security expert, suggested that the military should uproot the gangs from the Pacific coast, much of which is controlled by the CJNG, as well as the country&#39;s &quot;central plateau,&quot; where they use two strategic highways that are key for both legal and illegal trade in western and northern Mexico.</p><p>The operation that ended the life of &quot;El Mencho&quot; was &quot;a triumph for the military and the president, in the short term. But if they don&#39;t control the consequences, it can all backfire on them,&quot; Manaut warned.</p><p>lp/acc/jpo/aha</p></div></article></div>",
