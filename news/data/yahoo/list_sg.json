CABALLERO-REYNOLDS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Donald Trump&#39;s unleashing of operation &quot;Epic Fury&quot; against Iran has once more underscored the long and bitter struggle between US presidents and Congress over who has the power to decide on foreign military action.</p><p>In his video address announcing &quot;major combat&quot; with the Islamic republic, Trump didn&#39;t once mention any authorization or consultation with the US House of Representatives or Senate.</p><p>In doing so he sidelined not only Democrats, who called for an urgent war powers vote, but also his own Republican party as he asserts his dominance over a largely cowed legislature.</p><p>A US official said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had called top congressional leaders known as the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; to give them a heads up on the Iran attack -- adding that one was unreachable.</p><p>Rubio also &quot;laid out the situation&quot; and consulted with the same leaders on Tuesday in an hour-long briefing, the US official said.</p><p>According to the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war.</p><p>But at the same time the founding document of the United States first signed in 1787 says that the president is the &quot;commander in chief&quot; of the military, a definition that US leaders have in recent years taken very broadly.</p><p>The last official declaration of war by Congress was as far back as World War II.</p><p>There was no such proclamation during the unpopular Vietnam War, and it was then that Congress sought to reassert its powers.</p><p>In 1973 it adopted the War Powers Resolution, passed over Richard Nixon&#39;s veto, to become the only lasting limit on unilateral presidential military action abroad.</p><p>The act allows the president to carry out a limited military intervention to respond to an urgent situation created by an attack against the United States.</p><p>In his video address on Saturday, Trump evoked an &quot;imminent&quot; threat to justify strikes against Iran.</p><p>- Sixty days -</p><p>Yet under this law, the president must still inform Congress within 48 hours.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>It also says that if the president deploys US troops for a military action for more than 60 days, the head of state must then obtain the authorization of Congress for continued action.</p><p>That falls short of an official declaration of war.</p><p>The US Congress notably authorized the use of force in such a way after the September 11, 2011 attacks on the United States by Al-Qaeda. Presidents have used it over the past two decades for not only the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan but a series of operations in several countries linked to the &quot;War on Terror.&quot;</p><p>Trump is far from the first US president to launch military operations without going through Congress.</p><p>Democrat Bill Clinton launched US air strikes against Kosovo in 1999 as part of a NATO campaign, despite the lack of a green light from skeptical lawmakers.</p><p>Barack Obama did the same for airstrikes in Libya in 2011.</p><p>Trump followed their example in his first term in 2018 when he launched airstrikes in Syria along with Britain and France.</p><p>But since his return to power the 79-year-old has sought to push presidential power to its limits, and that includes in the military sphere.</p><p>Trump has ordered strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in Latin America without consulting Congress, and in June 2025 struck Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities.</p><p>Perhaps the most controversial act was when he ordered the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in a lightning military raid on January 3.</p><p>Republicans however managed to knock down moves by Democrats for a rare war powers resolution that would have curbed his authority over Venezuela operations.</p><p>Trump has meanwhile sought to extend his powers over the home front. Democrats have slammed the Republican for deploying the National Guard in several US cities in what he calls a crackdown on crime and immigration.</p><p>aue-dk/dw</p></div></article></div>",

oil-rich region&#39;s wealthy rulers.</p><p>Missiles streaked across clear desert skies as smoke plumed from US bases in Manama and Abu Dhabi and loud thuds shook high-rise windows in Dubai.</p><p>In Qatar, dozens of people fled in panic as a falling missile plunged into a residential neighbourhood, erupting in a fireball as it hit the street.</p><p>And in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates&#39; capital, golfers enjoying a quiet round were stunned to see dozens of projectiles flying overhead.</p><p>The Gulf monarchies have worked hard to stay on the periphery of Middle East conflict, relying on their stability to attract business, trade and tourism.</p><p>The staunch US allies have carefully courted Iran, their powerful Shia neighbour. Saudi Arabia, a rival heavyweight, mended ties with Tehran after a seven-year rupture in 2023.</p><p>Given their reputation for calm, Saturday&#39;s sudden attacks on US military bases caused widespread shock among the Gulf&#39;s diverse, expat-heavy populations.</p><p>In Bahrain&#39;s capital Manama, residents were hurriedly evacuated from the Juffair district housing the US navy&#39;s Fifth Fleet, whose base was hit in the attack.</p><p>&quot;When we heard the sounds, we cried out of fear,&quot; said Jana Hassan, a 15-year-old school student, who was visiting a friend in the area.</p><p>&quot;We didn&#39;t know what to do... I will never forget the sound of those loud blasts.&quot;</p><p>In Dubai, the Middle East&#39;s commercial hub with the world&#39;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, residents looked up to see missiles surge through the sky.</p><p>&quot;It was a rumble and then a bang,&quot; one resident told AFP, asking not to be named.</p><p>- &#39;Very scary and very loud&#39; -</p><p>An American resident of Qatar&#39;s capital Doha, who also asked not to be identified, heard two blasts as she was driving home, where she &quot;heard several more and the glass was shaking&quot;.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>She said she was &quot;furious&quot; about the instability, after 20 years of living in Qatar. Her teenage sons, she said, are &quot;asking me if we will have to go back home&quot;.</p><p>Qatar was targeted twice last year, when Iran mounted a telegraphed attack on the Al Udeid US base in June and Israel struck a Hamas meeting in Doha in September.</p><p>Those attacks were a Gulf rarity at the time. The UAE had not been troubled since a deadly assault by Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels in 2022, whose attacks on Saudi Arabia have also stopped in recent years.</p><p>&quot;As a Lebanese, I am traumatised,&quot; a 31-year-old expat and mother of two living in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, told AFP.</p><p>&quot;We came to the Gulf because it&#39;s known to be safer than Lebanon. Now I don&#39;t know what to do or how to think really,&quot; added the woman, who did not want to be named.</p><p>Another Riyadh resident, from Jordan, said: &quot;It was honestly very scary and very loud.</p><p>&quot;I was just walking out with my little boy when we suddenly heard the blast. People around us were looking up at the sky, trying to understand what was happening.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not something you expect in Riyadh.&quot;</p><p>burs-th/ds/dc</p></div></article></div>",

New studies show that many of those extensions contain hazardous chemicals. - NickyLloyd/E+/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Almost every Black woman or girl has, at some point, purchased hair extensions for box braids, boho braids, twists or faux locs.</p><p>For many Black women, these “protective styles” are worn year-round to protect and maintain their natural hair. For others, they’re a pre-vacation splurge — an easy way to shield one’s curls from the harshness of salty ocean water or a chlorine-filled pool. Beauty shops feature walls of extension colors — 1b, 30, 27, 24 or maybe even 613 — ready to be purchased and installed by a pro or a patient auntie.</p><p>But a growing number of studies are revealing dozens of potentially dangerous chemicals and carcinogens in these hair extensions: a Consumer Reports study <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/wigs-hair-extensions/braiding-hair-heavy-metals-vocs-follow-up-test-a9549045438/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published this week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published this week</a> found lead in 29 brands of extensions, while a peer-reviewed study <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/hair-extensions-contain-many-more-dangerous-chemicals-previously-thought\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:published earlier in February;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">published earlier in February</a> found dozens of hazardous chemicals, some of which have been linked with cancer, birth defects and reproductive issues, <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/envhealth.5c00549\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:across 43 hair samples;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">across 43 hair samples</a>. Some samples in the latter study had chemicals that should have required consumer warning labels under California’s Proposition 65.</p><p>Research has yet to determine whether or not these hair extensions are dangerous or could be causing illness. But both studies indicate how a largely unregulated billion-dollar industry fueled by Black women may also be disproportionately harming them.</p><h3>Hair extensions are still commonly used</h3><p>Elissia Franklin, a research scientist and analytic chemist at the Silent Spring Institute, grew up with “all the Black girl styles,” she said, like box braids, regular braids, relaxed hair and straightened hair. In the past, she’d get rashes on her neck after wearing extensions in her hair, but it wasn’t until she was researching flame retardants in couches as an adult that she realized the same chemicals existed in the hair commonly sold at beauty supply stores.</p><p>Her research, published in February in the American Chemical Society journal Environment &amp; Health, analyzed common brands of both synthetic and human hair purchased online and from local beauty supply stores. Included in those samples: flame retardants, pesticides, organotins (which are linked to skin irritation) and more. More than 80% of the hair samples tested contained chemicals linked to breast cancer specifically, and all but two of the 43 samples tested contained known hazardous chemicals.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034><noscript><img alt=\"Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PB4WT.aWuamrLwHItT1V_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/f1f54bf894ad59408ea5dd7269bb4034 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Bundles of hair extensions are commonly purchased and used by Black women for a variety of styles. - Moment RF/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Franklin’s work follows a 2025 Consumer Reports study, which made the rounds on social media last year after finding carcinogens in 10 synthetic braiding hair extensions.</p><p>But even as research about these chemicals mounts, business continues as usual in many hair braiding shops across the country.</p><p>The owner of Passion Braiding Salon outside of Austin, Texas said she heard about some chemicals in braiding extension hair on social media a few months ago, but hasn’t heard concerns from clients, most of whom bring hair purchased elsewhere to appointments. When asked if she was worried about her own exposure to harmful products, she said she wasn’t sure.</p><p>Marcy Jones, a braider on the South Side of Chicago, has been braiding hair for seven years. While she has heard of chemicals in hair extensions — some of her clients say they’re “allergic” to the hair, so Jones will pre-wash the extensions — she said she disinfects her tools and isn’t worried about her own exposure.</p><p>One braider at Braids By Queen in Dallas said she wasn’t aware of chemicals in braiding hair, but she always washes any extensions in hot water before use, which she’s done since she was a child in Benin. One Charlotte, North Carolina braider said she hadn’t heard of any risks at all.</p><p>While many people might use hair extensions without obvious problems, irritation is relatively common. Natural hair forums, websites and influencers have for years provided information about these so-called “allergic reactions.” Soaking the hair in apple cider vinegar is a common at-home remedy that may help reduce irritation with mixed results. Still, box braids and other extension styles can start at $200, depending on the length, width and type, and can take up to 10 hours to complete — meaning many Black women have learned to grin and bear the discomfort.</p><p>Hennii Dorsey is a co-owner of The Griyn Thumb salon just outside of Atlanta. She grew up wearing braids with extensions and never had a problem, she said, but that changed about 10 years ago. After braiding her hair with extensions, her head felt like it was covered in red ants, she said, “like they were biting me all over my scalp.”</p><p>“When I looked at my scalp, I noticed it was red, like it was burning,” Dorsey said. “I had to shave it off, that’s how bad the burn was.”</p><p>The braiding hair changed, she said. She began noticing labels like “non-flammable,” making her wonder about the types of chemicals manufacturers treated the hair with. In her own salon, she began warning clients about the potential side effects of hair extensions. Now, she refuses to use hair extensions altogether — synthetic or human.</p><p>Women who want extensions will take the risk no matter what the research says, Dorsey said, “even if they think it’s cancer-causing.”</p><h3>‘What Black hair product is safe?’</h3><p>Though many of the hair braiders interviewed seemed unconcerned by the potential harm they may face, those braiders are the “most vulnerable population,” said Franklin, the researcher. They work with these products day-in and day out, sometimes for decades, seeing multiple clients a week.</p><p>“I do understand where there’s hesitancies,” Franklin said. “What Black hair product is safe? I do think that braiders should be aware, but also so should the manufacturers. It shouldn’t be on the hair braiders to make individual decisions.”</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517><noscript><img alt=\"Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.t8Ap4t31gYqgtMc2j2ziQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/45e64eb91f723fd68ff8749db2ee8517 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Beyond hair extensions, many Black hair care products have been shown to contain dangerous chemicals. - RuslanDashinsky/iStockphoto/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>For every Black woman, the calculus around hair safety can feel ever-changing. Relaxers and chemical straighteners, touted for their easy-to-manage outcomes, saw a decline in use as more people learned about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/hair-straightening-formaldehyde-fda-deadline?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde</a>, a key ingredient in relaxer products and a carcinogen.</p><p>Now hair extensions, used by many women as “protective styles” for their natural hair, may also be dangerous, to say nothing of weaves or wigs. And the potential harms exist beyond the hair itself: many brands of gels, glue, edge-control, oil sheen, detangling spray and other everyday products for Black women have been shown to contain <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:formaldehyde-releasing preservatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">formaldehyde-releasing preservatives</a>.</p><p>“Black women use more hair products, and we are doing our hair in these very intense styles, more often than probably any other group of people,” Franklin said. “Those chemicals shouldn’t be in the products.”</p><p>Still, Franklin gets the sense that no one in her circle is shocked anymore, she said. There’s an expectation that some products are hazardous, she said, and there’s no way to really know what product is completely safe. A product considered to be nonhazardous could later prove to be harmful after all.</p><p>Everything carries some sort of risk, Franklin said — our food, our water, even our clothes. Trying to reduce that risk, she said, is all we can do.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

arch-foes last June.</p><p>The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against military targets in Iran on Saturday, sparking a rapid Iranian retaliation towards Israel.</p><p>In the

that US and Israeli warplanes were attacking Iran.</p><p>Like many Iranians living in exile in neighbouring Turkey, Reza, who did not want to give his surname, has been glued to his phone since news broke that Israel and the United States had begun air strikes on Iran.</p><p>Despite worrying about their families, most exiles in Turkey&#39;s largest city told AFP they were happy with the strikes, which US President Donald Trump had threatened in January over Iran&#39;s protest crackdown that left thousands dead.</p><p>&quot;America is attacking the military bases, the people who 40 days ago were killing our children, so they are helping us. This war is no good, people will die, but I&#39;m happy,&quot; Reza, a mature student, told AFP.</p><p>Ali, a film director who like almost all the Iranians interviewed by AFP did not give his surname, agreed.</p><p>&quot;Now people in Iran are full of&nbsp;hope and they are very, very happy,&quot; Ali said.</p><p>&quot;Iranians have been counting the minutes until America came to destroy the regime.&quot;</p><p>Over the past few weeks, Trump has sent warships and dozens of fighter planes to the Middle East, raising fears of a US strike -- even as US and Iranians diplomats held indirect talks on Iran&#39;s nuclear programme.</p><p>But early on Saturday, the tensions came to a head as Israeli and US warplanes began hitting targets in Iran, with Trump urging Iranians to stand up to their government and telling them: &quot;The hour of your freedom is at hand.&quot;</p><p>Turkey, which shares a 500-kilometre (300-mile) border with Iran, currently hosts more than 74,000 Iranians with residence permits and some 5,000 refugees.</p><p>While the unrest has raised fears of an influx of people, there have been no reports of unusual activity at the Turkey-Iran border so far.</p><p>- &#39;Difficult days ahead&#39; -</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I&#39;m both worried and happy, hoping for Iran&#39;s freedom,&quot; said Sepideh, a former teacher, who told AFP she managed to speak to a few friends in the morning, despite Iran cutting off all internet access.</p><p>Even with the internet shutdown, Mehdi, an engineer from the northern Iranian city of Tabriz, said he had managed to reach his family on Friday night.</p><p>&quot;Everyone was aware of the possibility of war, so they have been saving fuel and storing enough food. They are planning to move to rural areas,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We never wanted war in our country. It is the mullahs&#39; brutal theocracy that has put us in this situation,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t support Trump or Israel either, we want freedom and democracy, but this will not come easily.

Saturday as campaigning kicked off for next month&#39;s presidential election in the oil-rich central African nation.</p><p>Thousands of supporters turned out to watch Sassou Nguesso parade in an open-topped convertible at&nbsp;a rally held by the president&#39;s Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the country&#39;s economic and oil capital Pointe-Noire, on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>Campaigning will end on March 13, with the first round of voting on March 15.</p><p>Six opposition candidates have formally confirmed they will be standing, including first-time 34-year-old candidate Destin Gavin, from the Republican Movement (MR).</p><p>But the fragmented and muzzled opposition stands little chance of winning, with the ruling party promising a &quot;wave&quot; in favour of its &quot;patriarch&quot;, according to roadside campaign posters.</p><p>&quot;Have no fear, on March 15, we will win!&quot; Sassou Nguesso told the rally, dressed in a white shirt adorned with an elephant.</p><p>The career military officer first led Congo under the one-party system from 1979 to 1992 before losing the country&#39;s first multi-party elections to former prime minister Pascal Lissouba.</p><p>He overthrew Lissouba in a civil war to return to power in 1997.</p><p>Earlier this month, he announced he would be seeking a new five-year term, which, according to the constitution, would be his last.</p><p>Sassou Nguesso is one of Africa&#39;s longest-ruling leaders after Paul Biya of Cameroon, who has been in office since 1982, and Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who took power in a 1979 coup.</p><p>He was the victor in 2002 and 2009 and was able to stand again -- and win -- in 2016 and 2021 after a constitutional change that removed the upper age limit of 70 and extended the maximum number of terms of office.</p><p>- Contested elections -</p><p>Congo-Brazzaville, a former French colony, is rich in oil but nearly half of its six million people live below the poverty line.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story

in Sassou Nguesso, some pointed to the country&#39;s economic worries.</p><p>&quot;We came here to support him, but the Congolese people are suffering. What we want is work,&quot; says Flora Kouka, a nurse.</p><p>At Saturday&#39;s rally, Sassou Nguesso touted his economic record all the same, pointing to the development of the roads, fossil fuel sector and farming, and conceded he would have to pass the baton at some point.</p><p>&quot;Our generation is laying the groundwork for the youth to pick up the torch one day,&quot; he said.</p><p>His political opponents have systematically contested all of his election victories since 2002.</p><p>Two candidates who ran in the 2016 elections -- General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko and Andre Okombi Salissa -- are still being held after convictions for &quot;attacking internal security&quot; in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>They had strongly disputed the official results, which gave Sassou Nguesso 60 percent of the vote.</p><p>NGOs and civil society groups regularly condemn violations of civil liberties and threats against political opponents.</p><p>The president is nonetheless reputed to have brought a degree of stability back to the country scarred by civil war in the 1990s and to a region plagued by conflict.</p><p>clt/phz/sbk/st</p></div></article></div>",

And both of those outcomes were on me.</span></p><p><span>That moment revealed a pattern I was reluctant to face. Even though I was divorced with 50/50 custody, I often treated parenting as a task I could delegate. I was trying too hard to be liked. I wanted to be the fun dad, not the firm one — and that meant avoiding some of the more mundane or difficult responsibilities.

Patel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\"><span>Reena B. Patel</span></a><span>, is whether they get defensive when asked to take responsibility. </span></p><p><span>“That defensiveness is usually a sign that you know you’re not pulling your weight,” she said. Other warning signs include expecting partners to handle the majority of emotional labor and avoiding tasks until someone else steps in.</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-according-to-men_l_6880f2b9e4b0a3d10a1fbbf3?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Grown-*** Men Reveal The Moment They Knew They Were A &#39;Manchild&#39;</a></strong></p><p><span>Scott said the first step is uncomfortable but simple: “Approach your partner and say, ‘I want to make sure I’m doing my part in managing our life together. Could we sit together and talk about something like the weekly schedule?’” The goal isn’t to take over but to participate with genuine interest.</span></p><p><span>Planning was Garcia’s breakthrough: “PLAN! I never used to plan anything. Now, if I don’t write it down or put it on my calendar, it won’t happen.”</span></p><p><span>Letting go of pride was the first hurdle Westerholtz had to face. </span></p><p><span>“Feeling useless at first” was the hardest part, he said. “Vulnerability isn’t something most men are trained in. I had to learn not to jump to fixing, but to actually be with pain or mess: my own and others’.”</span></p><p><strong>Family: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stepparent-toxic-comments_l_693c65afe4b018dc36f1ba4f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">This Stepdad Is Sharing The 5 Most Toxic Things People Tell Stepparents</a></strong></p><p><span>Westerholtz now checks in weekly with his partner and uses a shared calendar with reminders like “pack lunch” and “doctor follow-up.” </span></p><p><span>“Visibility equals responsibility,” he said.</span></p><p><span>These changes have brought broader impacts. “There’s less resentment. More tenderness. My partner doesn’t have to mother me, and that makes space for partnership,” Westerholtz said. </span></p><p><span>The change has also shaped how their son understands masculinity<em>:</em></span><span>&nbsp;“I also see my son learning not just how to survive, but how to be a man who feels, apologizes, and holds others with care.”</span></p><p><span>Consistency became the turning point in Garcia’s relationship with his daughter, but it required moving beyond traditional activities. </span></p><p><span>“Being intentional with our time, and not just taking her to dinners or baseball games, but getting to know her personally, has built a relationship between us that is indescribable,” Garcia said. When Garcia volunteered as a <a href=\"https://dadsofgreatstudents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">WATCH D.O.G. (Dads of Great Students)</a>, seeing his daughter light up when he showed up for lunch made her feel supported at school and among friends.</span></p><h2><strong>What Kind Of Man Do You Want To Be?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>These fathers are consciously breaking generational patterns. For Westerholtz, this transformation meant redefining what it means to be a man for his son. “Before, I think I believed being a man meant protecting, fixing and staying strong. Now I think it’s about being present, especially when things are messy.” </span></p><p><span>He tells his son it’s OK to feel scared or sad, and that real strength means talking about emotions instead of shutting down: “We talk about emotions like weather. They pass, but you don’t need to pretend it’s sunny when it’s not.”</span></p><p><span>This shift in emotional openness extends beyond family. In his male friendships, Westerholtz brings the same vulnerability. “It used to be all banter and distraction, surface-level. But when I started being real about how hard things were with my son’s health, I found that most men were relieved. Like they’d been waiting for someone to go first.” As he puts it: “Vulnerability invites connection, not just with our partners, but with our mates too.”</span></p><p><span>Patel notes that children benefit directly when fathers develop emotional maturity. “They model respect, empathy and resilience skills that their children will carry into adulthood. Partners also feel more supported, less stressed and free to be individuals, not caretakers for another adult.”</span></p><p><span>The ‘manchild’ label stings because it highlights a gap between how men see themselves and how they actually show up. Like Garcia and Westerholtz, I’m learning to show up differently for my sons. I need to be a father who is sometimes a friend, not a friend who is sometimes a father. That track meet taught me the hard way. Now, I check every appointment, every schedule, every exam and essay due date. Nothing has been missed since. </span></p><p><span>My sons are 18 now, and my habit of double-checking everything still annoys them. But I would rather that than let them down again.</span></p><p><span>As Westerholtz put it: “You’re not less of a man for softening. You’re just becoming less of a boy.”</span></p><p><strong><em>The original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.</em></strong></p><h3>Related...</h3><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dads-anger-coping-advice_l_686d40a1e4b088c62569aacc?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">How To Avoid Being The &#39;Angry Dad&#39; — Even If That&#39;s The Kind Of Father You Had</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sabrina-carpenter-album-artwork-backlash_n_684af224e4b0f2259d6120d7?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Sabrina Carpenter Fans Are Fuming Over Her ‘Degrading’ New Album Artwork</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mankeeping-dating-emotional-labor-research_l_682f3305e4b0ef574bf5e553?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">I&#39;m A Gender Researcher &amp; This Is The Real Reason Women Are Stepping Away From Dating &amp; Relationships</a></p></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-grown-up-goog_l_69a07223e4b0b62154a85d2e?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read the original on HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Read the original on HuffPost</a></strong></p></div></article></div>",
