It also removed its Chinese CEO, citing concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.</p><p>Nexperia&#39;s move came after the Dutch chipmaker&#39;s Chinese unit resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but stipulated that all sales to distributors would need to be settled using the Chinese yuan. Previously, transactions had been settled with foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar.</p><p>LARGE VOLUMES OF CHIPS</p><p>The company produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. Some 70% of the Netherlands-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors.</p><p>&quot;While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,&quot; the letter said.</p><p>&quot;Unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site. Nexperia is developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.&quot;</p><p>Nexperia added that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its site in Dongguan or from the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution to the problem.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Nexperia said it is financially independent of Wingtech and it does not raise capital from Wingtech, the letter showed.</p><p>A spokesperson for Nexperia confirmed it sent the letter and the company could not comment further. Nexperia China and Wingtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Dutch government referred questions about the wafer shut-off to Nexperia, saying the move had been a corporate decision while state intervention &quot;concerns the preservation of production capacity and is not aimed at the company&#39;s day-to-day operations&quot;.</p><p>The Netherlands is in discussions with European governments and the European Commission, as well as Chinese authorities, &quot;to work toward a constructive solution,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>IMPACT ON PRODUCTION</p><p>Court filings showed that the seizure by the Dutch government came as U.S. pressure was rising on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities say governance shortcomings were the trigger.</p><p>On October 4, China&#39;s commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China.</p><p>Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the possible impact on production, with Stellantis saying on Thursday that it had set up a &quot;war room&quot; to monitor the situation.</p><p>Japanese automaker Nissan said it had enough chips at the moment to last until the first week of November without disruption.</p><p>Some Nexperia products that used to cost just a few Chinese cents have gone up in price to two or three yuan each over the past two weeks, more than 10 times their original cost, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p><p>(Reporting by Che Pan in Beijing and Wen-Yee Lee in Taipei; Writing by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Thomas Derpinghaus)</p></div></article></div>",

Xinjiang in a \"candid\" first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea (STR)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Japan&#39;s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Friday she raised &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the South China Sea, Hong Kong and Xinjiang in a &quot;candid&quot; first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Xi in turn told Japan&#39;s first woman prime minister, long seen as a China hawk, at the talks in South Korea that he hopes her government will have a &quot;correct understanding&quot; of his country, according to state media.</p><p>Takaichi has been a regular visitor to the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan&#39;s war dead and is an outspoken backer of Taiwan, advocating security ties with the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory.</p><p>With both having separately met US President Donald Trump in recent days, Takaichi said she told Xi at the APEC summit that she wanted a &quot;strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between Japan and China&quot;.</p><p>However, she told reporters that she also raised a number of thorny issues with the Chinese leader, saying that it was &quot;important for us to engage in direct, candid dialogue&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We... expressed serious concerns regarding actions in the South China Sea, as well as the situations in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,&quot; Takaichi said.</p><p>Beijing vehemently denies accusations of human rights abuses against the Uyghurs, saying its policies in Xinjiang in northwestern China have eradicated extremism and boosted development.</p><p>China has sweeping assertions of sovereignty over the South China Sea despite an international ruling in 2016 concluding its claims have no legal basis.</p><p>Takaichi said she also raised with Xi the Japanese-administered Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea&nbsp;where Japanese and Chinese vessels frequently face off.</p><p>She also said she spoke to Xi about export controls on items including rare earths that are vital for a wide range of industries.</p><p>Takaichi added that she also pressed for the release of Japanese citizens detained in China and requested that the safety of Japanese expatriates in China be ensured.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>&quot;I conveyed that we would like these matters to be addressed,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Regarding Taiwan, there was some discussion from the Chinese side,&quot; Takaichi said.</p><p>&quot;I stated that for the stability and security in this region, maintaining good cross-strait relations is important,&quot; she said.</p><p>- History -</p><p>Xi told Takaichi he hoped Japan would also stick to the &quot;general direction of peaceful, friendly and cooperative bilateral relations&quot;, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported.</p><p>He added that Japan &quot;should adhere to and fulfil clear provisions on major issues such as history&quot; as outlined in political documents agreed by Japan and China, Xinhua said.</p><p>Visits to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo by senior Japanese politicians have long angered China, as well as the two Koreas, because it also honours convicted war criminals.</p><p>Takaichi was also an acolyte of right-wing former premier Shinzo Abe.</p><p>Long-pacifist Japan, a close US ally, has increased security ties with Washington as well as defence spending, while moving to acquire &quot;counter-strike&quot; capabilities.</p><p>Around 60,000 US military personnel are based in Japan. Takaichi hosted Trump this week, with both making speeches on the deck of an American aircraft carrier.</p><p>She announced last week Japan would spend two percent of gross domestic product on defence this fiscal year, two years ahead of schedule.</p><p>&quot;It could be a frosty get-to-know-you meeting as Xi Jinping has not sent a congratulatory message to Takaichi, wary of her reputation as a China hawk,&quot; Yee Kuang Heng, a professor at the University of Tokyo&#39;s Graduate School of Public Policy, told AFP before the meeting.</p><p>&quot;Overall though, stability is a shared priority,&quot; Heng said.</p><p>hih-stu/pbt</p></div></article></div>",

Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”</p><p>At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.</p><p>But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.</p><p>“Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.</p><p>The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:longest-ever government shutdown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">longest-ever government shutdown</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/snap-benefits-food-stamps-explainer?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Critical food aid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">Critical food aid</a> for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

ferocious storm has devastated Caribbean islands and is expected to become an &quot;extratropical cyclone&quot; later in the day, reaching the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest advisory.</p><p>&quot;After Melissa becomes post-tropical, a brief period of heavy rain and gusty winds is possible over the southern Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland tonight,&quot; the NHC added.</p><p>Flooding was expected to subside in the Bahamas although high water could persist in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and neighboring Dominican Republic, the agency said.</p><p>The storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.</p><p>Melissa smashed into both Jamaica and Cuba with enormous force, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery.</p><p>In Jamaica, &quot;the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Melissa is now at 19,&quot; including nine in Westmoreland and eight in St. Elizabeth, both parishes in the Caribbean island&#39;s hard-hit west, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told local news outlets including the Jamaica Gleaner.</p><p>Communications and transportation access remains largely down in Jamaica and Cuba, and comprehensive assessment of the damage could take days.</p><p>In impoverished Haiti, the country&#39;s civil defense agency said Thursday that the death toll had risen to 30, with 20 people injured and another 20 missing.</p><p>It said more than 1,000 homes have been flooded, with some 16,000 people in shelters.</p><p>In the east of the communist island of Cuba, battling its worst economic crisis in decades, people struggled through inundated streets lined with flooded and collapsed homes.</p><p>The storm smashed windows, downed power cables and mobile communications, and tore off roofs and tree branches.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

(for Friday&#39;s losses) was uncertainty about the future policy of the Federal Reserve,&quot; said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.</p><p>&quot;The negative response to Meta&#39;s bloated AI

agreement.</p><p>While the Fed on Wednesday cut interest rates as expected, Powell&#39;s follow-up comments that another reduction by the end of the year was not guaranteed hit sentiment.</p><p>The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan held their rates steady Thursday.</p><p>The ECB&#39;s stance was reinforced by data Friday showing inflation eased closer to the central bank&#39;s two-percent target in October.</p><p>European stocks slipped in Friday midday trades, tracking losses on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq closed down 1.6 percent Thursday.</p><p>An earnings report released by Apple after US markets closed showed quarterly revenue that beat estimates, powered by iPhone and services revenue.</p><p>Amazon also reported earnings that were better than expected, driven by surging

agreed to cut some tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing committed to keeping supplies of critical rare earths flowing.</p><p>Trump and Xi have not yet signed a comprehensive trade agreement, and

There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>“Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.</p><p>Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”</p><p>“What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.</p><p>But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope.

The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.</p><p>The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.</p><p>Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.</p><p>States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”</p><p>While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles.

Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PAeRiLuOIm7wCzJQHysoyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/999a236cb31311259d6cfcc9a770d5c4><noscript><img alt=\"An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PAeRiLuOIm7wCzJQHysoyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/999a236cb31311259d6cfcc9a770d5c4 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An aerial view of the Port of Bandar Abbas in the strait of Hormuz, December 10, 2023. - Nicolas Economou/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.</p><p>Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran.

Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.</p><p>It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”</p><p>“We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”</p><p>Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.</p><p>“Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.</p><p>The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.</p><p>“Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles. That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.</p><h3>Long-standing ties</h3><p>China has long been a <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/07/18/china/china-iran-sco-israel-axis-intl-hnk?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:diplomatic and economic ally;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">diplomatic and economic ally</a> for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.</p><p>That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DdvKlfzFLs_mTJ.mZGCEnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5dd395a4bfe38bd243c94b76a0806977><noscript><img alt=\"Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DdvKlfzFLs_mTJ.mZGCEnQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/5dd395a4bfe38bd243c94b76a0806977 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Oil storage tanks at a petrochemical production base on the outskirts of Shanghai, China, in June. - Bloomberg/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.</p><h3>Earlier shipments</h3><p>In February, CNN <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2025/02/13/middleeast/iran-is-rearming-its-missile-program-and-a-ship-of-supplies-just-arrived-from-china-western-sources-say?cid=ios_app&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported the shipment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">reported the shipment</a> of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”</p><p>Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.</p><p>The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.</p><p>Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.</p><p>“First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.</p><p>Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.</p><p>Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program.

In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”</p><p>Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.</p><p>So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.</p><p>“Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”</p><p><em>CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
