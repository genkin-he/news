killing of the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) by Mexican authorities on Sunday sparked widespread violence, with gang members opening fire on soldiers and setting up burning roadblocks in various parts of the country.</p><p>The killing of Nemesio Oseguera, also known as &quot;El Mencho,&quot; constituted a victory for the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum.</p><p>Experts now warn that the true challenge is whether she can contain the inevitable fighting as the CJNG enters into a war over control of one of Mexico&#39;s largest criminal groups.</p><p>Elite Mexican soldiers supported by US intelligence agencies killed Oseguera on Sunday in Tapalpa, in the western state of Jalisco, where he was wounded while trying to flee. He died while en route to the hospital.</p><p>Experts say the cartel&#39;s response -- gunbattles, highway blockades, and the burning of cars, businesses, and banks in 20 out of Mexico&#39;s 32 states -- was not just revenge for the death of their leader.</p><p>It was a show of force.</p><p>- What can the cartel do? -</p><p>The cartel will have to fill the void left by &quot;El Mencho,&quot; who managed the organization of more than 30,000 members with a vertical command structure and an iron fist, according to academic experts.</p><p>For Raul Benitez Manaut, a national security expert, the question is whether there will be an agreed-upon transition of power between the second-tier hierarchy of the cartel, or whether Sunday&#39;s violence will unleash a far larger internal war.</p><p>If the criminal organization carries out more choreographed acts like they did on Sunday, they will put the Mexican government and security forces in &quot;far more awkward situations.&quot;</p><p>- Who will succeed &#39;El Mencho&#39;? -</p><p>Oseguera&#39;s power within the CJNG was so established that many believe he could have named his successor to ensure the cohesion of the cartel.</p><p>In 2025, the US Treasury Department said that Julio Alberto Castillo Rodriguez, the son-in-law of &quot;El Mencho,&quot; was &quot;considered a possible successor to Oseguera.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Working through the industrial Pacific coast port of Manzanillo, Castillo has facilitated the entrance of precursor chemicals the cartel uses to produce fentanyl and other illicit drugs that are trafficked to the United States, the Treasury Department said at the time in a communique.</p><p>- Can the government contain the violence? -</p><p>The organization&#39;s violent response to the killing of its leader provoked widespread terror among the Mexican population.</p><p>&quot;It was about sending a message to the Mexican government and rival cartels, saying &#39;we&#39;re still powerful, we&#39;re still strong,&#39;&quot; Mike Vigil, a former DEA agent, said.</p><p>They are warning that the killing of &quot;El Mencho&quot; will not weaken them, threatening their enemies to keep them from taking over their drug trafficking routes and territories, he added.</p><p>The government has been &quot;taking precautions&quot; by deploying thousands of soldiers to Jalisco and other states, according to the ex-DEA agent, who believes the Mexican military has the situation under control.</p><p>Manaut, the national security expert, suggested that the military should uproot the gangs from the Pacific coast, much of which is controlled by the CJNG, as well as the country&#39;s &quot;central plateau,&quot; where they use two strategic highways that are key for both legal and illegal trade in western and northern Mexico.</p><p>The operation that ended the life of &quot;El Mencho&quot; was &quot;a triumph for the military and the president, in the short term. But if they don&#39;t control the consequences, it can all backfire on them,&quot; Manaut warned.</p><p>lp/acc/jpo/aha</p></div></article></div>",

If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.&quot;</p><p>The ​spokesperson ​added that Chinese intelligence and security services &quot;can legally compel Chinese citizens and companies ​to share sensitive data or grant unauthorized access to ‌their customers&#39; systems&quot; and promises by Chinese companies to protect customers&#39; privacy were &quot;entirely inconsistent with China&#39;s own laws and well-established practices.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>China has repeatedly rejected allegations of it using technology for spying purposes.</p><p>The Syrian Ministry of telecommunications told Reuters any decisions related to equipment and infrastructure are made &quot;in accordance with national technical and security standards, ensuring data protection and service continuity.&quot;</p><p>The ministry said it is also prioritizing the diversification of partnerships and technology sources to serve the national interest.</p><p>Syria&#39;s telecom infrastructure has relied heavily on Chinese technology due to U.S. sanctions imposed on successive Assad governments ‌over the civil war that grew from a crackdown on anti-government protests in ​2011.</p><p>Huawei technology accounts for more than 50% of the infrastructure of Syriatel and MTN, ​the country&#39;s only telecom operators, according to a senior source ​at one of the companies and documents reviewed by Reuters.

mother on February 12, 2026. - Rebecca Noble/Reuters</figcaption></div></figure><p>As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into its fourth, desperate week, her family has offered up to a million dollars for information leading to her return.</p><p>The staggering reward is, in some ways, a tacit admission that the investigation is entering a new phase as DNA evidence that once seemed promising hits roadblocks, and investigators acknowledge they still do not have a suspect in the kidnapping case.</p><p>Even as she said her family is “blowing on the embers of hope” that the 84-year-old will make it safely home, Savannah Guthrie acknowledged a sobering truth:</p><p>“We also know that she may be lost. She may already be gone,” Guthrie said in her video Tuesday announcing the reward. “But we need to know where she is.”</p><p>The tragic admission, coming more than a week after Guthrie’s last appeal to her mother’s captors, sparks questions as to why investigators and the family chose to wait weeks to put forward such a large and enticing reward. CNN spoke to law enforcement experts and analysts about the possible strategy behind the timing of such a compelling offer – and why it could portend a tragic turn in the investigation.</p><h3>An appeal to the inner circle</h3><p>In the weeks since Guthrie’s disappearance, thousands of tips have poured into the investigation’s hotline. But the tide began to ebb in recent days, and the Pima County 911 supervisor told CNN the number of credible tips had begun to slow.</p><p>Then, the Guthrie family offered their million-dollar reward.</p><p>Since the details of the reward were made public, the FBI told CNN investigators have received more than 750 credible tips – among a total of about 23,000 tips collected since the beginning of the investigation.</p><p>And while the number is significantly lower than the thousands of calls the tipline received earlier in the investigation, experts say that could be by design.</p><p>“This reward is designed to prompt somebody within the suspect’s orbit” to come forward, Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who served under President Obama, said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>“It’s not the suspect themselves that the messaging is focused on, it’s this broader orbit of associates – potentially friends, family, co-conspirators – really for them to break their silence.”</p><p>Someone with a personal connection to Guthrie’s abductor may not have been tempted by the prior $200,000 reward for information, but the prospect of up to a million-dollar payout could mitigate some of the risk of contacting law enforcement, Wackrow said.</p><h3>Why now?</h3><p>A source close to the family told CNN the Guthries were willing to put forward a similar reward earlier in the investigation, but there was concern such a large amount could inundate the call center tasked with sifting through tips.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why law enforcement may have advised the Guthries to wait before making such a large offer, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Josh Campbell said.</p><p>“Time is of the essence in a kidnapping case, and bogging down investigators with a mountain of false leads could have slowed their effort as they sorted fact from fiction,” he said.</p><p>And, he added, early in an investigation, the goal is to open a line of communication with the abductor and bring the case to a fast and safe resolution.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"An aerial view, the home of Nancy Guthrie is seen on February 24, 2026, in Tucson, Arizona - Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/noTiLt6GUDnpmWhnZsqynw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2de2780c46a82a6d920cef64e0693197><noscript><img alt=\"An aerial view, the home of Nancy Guthrie is seen on February 24, 2026, in Tucson, Arizona - Joe Raedle/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/noTiLt6GUDnpmWhnZsqynw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2de2780c46a82a6d920cef64e0693197 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>An aerial view, the home of Nancy Guthrie is seen on February 24, 2026, in Tucson, Arizona - Joe Raedle/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>“It can be very counterproductive to simultaneously appeal to the abductor to do the right thing, while at the same time encouraging people who might know the abductor to turn on him with the incentive of a million-dollar reward.”</p><p>The FBI’s crisis negotiators, Campbell said, would have likely been trying to find a balance between enticing people with direct knowledge of the kidnapping to come forward and not angering an abductor and inadvertently causing harm to the victim.</p><h3>What happens next?</h3><p>Sources close to both the Guthries and the investigation tell CNN the family has continued to work in lock step with authorities, and the new reward was offered in consultation with law enforcement.</p><p>Indeed, Savannah Guthrie’s language around the reward appeared to align with how the FBI framed its previous offers – with one key distinction.</p><p>In recent weeks, the FBI has <a href=\"https://x.com/FBIPhoenix/status/2022084453699350981\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:offered;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">offered</a> payouts for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”</p><p>But now, after acknowledging that her mother may be “dancing in heaven,” Savannah said her family is offering up to a million dollars for “any information that leads to her recovery.”</p><p>The subtle shift in language indicates the Guthrie family’s reward does not hinge on an arrest of Nancy’s captors. It may also be a reluctant nod to an even worse tragedy.</p><p>“This is shifting to acceptance of a whole variety, or a multitude of outcomes including the fact that (Nancy) may now be deceased and they’re looking for closure,” Wackrow said, adding he finds it “shocking” that it took weeks to get to this point in such a high-profile investigation.</p><p>“Again, (the $1 million reward) is a tactic; I would have expected it to be earlier on in this investigation, not midway through the fourth week.”</p><p><em>CNN’s Josh Campbell, Alisha Ebrahimji, Elizabeth Hartfield and Brian Stelter contributed to this report.</em></p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",

Nvidia.</p><p>Oil prices rose even as Iran and the United States began a new round of indirect talks on the Islamic republic&#39;s nuclear programme, in a last-ditch bid to avert war.</p><p>The market response to Nvidia&#39;s earnings Wednesday was muted as initial excitement over its record quarterly revenue gave way to concerns that sky-high expectations for AI have become almost impossible to meet.</p><p>Shares in the firm -- which last year became the first to top $5 trillion in market capitalisation -- dipped in after-hours trade in New York Wednesday and then fell 4.3 percent in trading on Thursday.</p><p>&quot;It says a lot when a stock market darling beating revenue forecasts by billions of dollars can no longer muster a positive share price reaction,&quot; said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.</p><p>&quot;The mood music is changing on&nbsp;Nvidia, and it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment,&quot; he added.</p><p>Trade Nation analyst David Morrison noted that Nvidia&#39;s shares had risen ahead of the earnings announcement.</p><p>Moreover, the announcement &quot;wasn&#39;t the &#39;stellar&#39; results with which the market has become accustomed, and this has left many investors pondering: &#39;What next?&#39;&quot;</p><p>Wall Street&#39;s main indices were mixed in early afternoon trading, with the blue-chip Dow flat but both the broader S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite indices lower.</p><p>- Stellantis, Rolls-Royce up -</p><p>Shares in multinational automaker Stellantis, which makes brands such as Jeep and Fiat, climbed&nbsp;six percent as trading got underway in New York.</p><p>The company posted a net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion) for last year, but it was mostly due to write-downs of assets as the carmaker shifts away from electric vehicles.</p><p>Major European indices advanced.</p><p>London set a fresh record, boosted by a&nbsp;4.5 percent rise in Rolls-Royce shares after the British engine-maker upgraded its guidance, announced a share buyback and posted soaring annual profits.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp

enter Cuban waters Wednesday and “infiltrate” the island, authorities said.</p><p>The shootout comes amid rising tensions between Cuba and the United States, which have both opened investigations into the incident</p><p>As more details continue to emerge about the fatal shooting, here’s what we know so far.</p><h3>What happened?</h3><p>Cuban border guard troops approached the boat after it entered the country’s territorial waters in Falcones Cay, Villa Clara province, just over 100 miles from Florida, Cuba’s Interior Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>A passenger aboard the boat fired at the Cuban patrol vessel, wounding its commander and prompting Cuban forces to return fire, the statement said.</p><p>Four people on the speedboat were killed and six others were wounded, it said. The survivors are in custody and receiving medical attention, the statement added.</p><p>The ministry later said the passengers were Cuban residents of the US armed with assault rifles, handguns and molotov cocktails and that they had intended to carry out an “infiltration for terrorist purposes.”</p><p>In addition, another individual, reportedly sent from the United States to help facilitate the operation, was arrested and has since confessed, according to the ministry. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.</p><p>The vessel, registered in the US as FL7726SH, according to Cuban authorities, is a 24-foot power boat manufactured in 1981, maritime database records show.</p><p>The location of the shootout, near Falcones Cay, is known for shallow waters, sandbars and beaches. It has historically been a route for Cuban migrants attempting the perilous journey to Florida.</p><h3>Who was involved?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nKIQRCf8azWLpA0aazNCRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bcd5902d281ded4618269cda82da1508><noscript><img alt=\"A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nKIQRCf8azWLpA0aazNCRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/bcd5902d281ded4618269cda82da1508 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>A policeman watches over the aftermath of a rare demonstration against Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in Havana, on July 11, 2021. - Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></div></figure><p>Cuban officials have named seven of the 10 passengers on the boat.</p><p>Two of the survivors had previously been wanted by Cuba for terrorism, the Interior Ministry said.</p><p>One of the men who the Cuban government said was arrested appears to have previously shared what seems to be a declaration of an upcoming attack. In a Facebook post, an individual identifying himself as Amijail Sánchez González reposted a document signed on January 31 by four anti-government groups that pledged to take “imminent” and “decisive” action.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Earlier this month, the same individual posted a video saying that if he was injured in any action, he would likely die, noting that he was taking blood thinners.</p><p>Michael J. Bustamante, a professor of Cuban studies at the University of Miami, told CNN that the organizations allegedly connected to the incident “may be known on certain corners of the Cuban diaspora/exile internet, but they are fringe groups that are unlikely to have direct connections to more mainstream Cuban-American political leaders.”</p><p>While Wednesday’s incident did not appear to be well-planned, Bustamante said it “recalls a long history of Cuban exile clandestine organizing and militancy dating to the 1960s and ’70s — both with and without US support, and sometimes in open defiance of the US government.”</p><p>“One question will be whether US officials (like the FBI) were aware of this organization and its activities,” he added.</p><p>The Cuban government also identified Conrado Galindo Sariol as one of the men on the boat.</p><p>Galindo’s son, Norge Evelio Galindo, had been imprisoned in Cuba for his participation in July 11, 2021, anti-government protests and was released in February 2024, according to a post Galindo made on Facebook.</p><p>“I’m proud of what my father just did,” Norge told CNN on Thursday. “I expected nothing less from him.”</p><p>“Although I didn’t know what he was doing, I always knew that if that opportunity presented itself, he wasn’t going to let it pass him by,” Norge added. Now living in Mexico, he said that he spoke to family back home in Cuba and his father’s wife in the US about his father’s actions.</p><p>“Everyone is baffled because they didn’t expect this,” he said, noting that his father had not been back to Cuba in 10 years.</p><p>In 2024, CNN also spoke with Galindo about his son’s imprisonment. Galindo’s cousin told CNN on Thursday that Galindo, too, was previously imprisoned for “not agreeing with that damned government and system.”</p><p>“What I know about him is that he lives in Florida, and like almost every Cuban who emigrated to this great nation, we don’t agree with the dictatorship that’s in our country, Cuba, a dictatorship that has been in power for 67 years, oppressing the people and with a Cuba in misery and destruction,” Leonardo Galindo said.</p><p>“But I didn’t imagine he and other compatriots would be on that journey to Cuba,” the cousin added.</p><p>While some anti-government Cuban exiles living in the US might hail the groups allegedly involved in Wednesday’s incident as “heroes or martyrs,” said Helen Yaffe, a professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow and Cuba expert, they are not well known or supported within Cuba.</p><h3>What has the US said?</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to reporters at Robert L.
