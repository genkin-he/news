He could not go to school with White children who played nearby. And only three percent of eligible Black voters in the South were registered to vote.</p><p>Like so many others of his generation, Jesse Jackson’s introduction to public life came through the Black church. There, he learned to lead and to reach the souls of those touched by his voice. He was mentored at the feet of a generation of men who saw the moral imperative of justice. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/us/reverend-jesse-jackson-death?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:His death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">His death</a> signals that their time with us is ending quickly.</p><p>There are so many things that are improbable about Jesse Jackson’s life. Born to an unwed, teen mother in the Jim Crow South, he emerged from that upbringing with a sense of uncommon purpose. He took that drive and embedded himself in the heart of the civil rights movement to become the youngest of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s staffers. In the 1970s, he branched out on his own to launch Operation PUSH.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"American civil rights leader and politician Rev.

With its mission of advancing the economic liberation of Black Americans and the poor, Jackson’s group quickly became a civil rights organization that had few equals in its ability to extract material changes to the practices of the monied power brokers in American society who still sought to keep Black Americans shut out of the nation’s economic life. His economic covenants opened the doors to corporate positions, franchises and real ownership for Black Americans for decades.</p><p>But perhaps the most improbable thing about Jackson’s life is his longevity.</p><p>For most of the six decades that he spent in public life, the spectre of death hung over him as it had for so many prominent Black men who were gunned down in their prime years. King was killed at 39. Medgar Evers at 37. Fred Hampton at 21.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>And yet, despite this reality, and the constant stream of threats he and his family faced, Jackson remained out front. He was a key figure in the effort to move beyond a fight for basic human rights and toward a future in which Black Americans had full economic and civic participation in the nation of their birth.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Rep.

Jim Crow style barriers to the ballot box are gone. Black Americans can be CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and owners of banks and businesses nation-wide. A Black man has been elected president, and a Black and South Asian woman elected vice president. But without the effort of Jackson and others of his generation, none of that may have come to be.</p><p>There is another lesson in Jackson’s life work and in the work of the civil rights movement that finally forced America to live up to its founding principles. It was never only for the benefit of Black Americans that they marched and sat-in and saw the insides of jail cells. It was for all Americans: women, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and so many others who subsequently benefited from their work.</p><p>In 1984, when Jackson ran for president the first time, his improbable campaign was a warning shot to a political establishment that had for decades accepted the votes of its constituent groups, but had not been willing to fully share power.</p><p>“We are members of the party and we don’t want to leave,” Jackson told his fellow Democrats. “But our self-respect is non-negotiable.”</p><p>He was, without question, powered by the support of ordinary Black Americans. They were the first to see themselves in him – an ordinary man from the South who chose to do extraordinary things. But he offered a path forward for the entire nation that left the divisions of the past behind.</p><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Rev.

America, our time has come,” he said on the stage of the Democratic National Convention in 1984.</p><p>With his 1984 and 1988 campaigns, Jackson altered the fabric of the Democratic Party. Like many outsider candidates, he ran against the establishment. And though he didn’t win the nomination, history shows that in many ways he was prescient in his brand of populist politics and his advocacy of many issues that later became mainstream.</p><p>The Democratic Party that Jackson ran in was one with delegate rules that were meant to keep candidates like him from the nomination. By changing those rules, he created the conditions that Barack Obama utilized <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/27/dnc.main?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:to win the nomination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">to win the nomination</a> in his history-making 2008 presidential bid.

In other words, toggling off algorithmic recommendations didn’t create a neutral slate for the X user.</p><p>“Deeply held concepts like partisan identity are unlikely to move over such short timeframes but what’s striking is that opinions on current politics&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;shift in just a few weeks,” Gauthier said. “That naturally raises the question of what years of exposure might do.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo</figcaption></div></figure><div class=caas-body><p>By AJ Vicens, Hina Suzuki and Kentaro Sugiyama</p><p>Feb 26 (Reuters) - In the days surrounding Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi&#39;s February election win, several dozen X accounts linked to a Chinese misinformation campaign attacked her deeply conservative views and hawkish approach to China, said a U.S. research institute focused on national security and foreign ‌policy.</p><p>The 35 accounts, along with nine channels on the microblogging site Tumblr, pushed corruption allegations and portrayed Takaichi as illegitimate and militaristic. The accounts suggest the prime minister ‌is a reckless &quot;cult-backed&quot; leader driving Japan toward war, said Maria Riofrio, a researcher with the Foundation for Defense of Democracy&#39;s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation.</p><p>The accounts, part of a network of at least 327 X and other social media ​accounts, have since December or earlier attacked adversaries of Beijing or pushed pro-China policy positions, and targeted human rights organizations and sought to influence domestic politics in Japan, the United States, the Philippines and Latin America, according to a new analysis by Riofrio.</p><p>A spokesperson for Takaichi said her office is aware of suspicious foreign social media accounts that have posted content related to Japan&#39;s elections.</p><p>&quot;We consider this to be a national security threat that undermines the very foundations of democracy, including the fairness of elections and freedom of the press. We believe that countermeasures must be urgently prioritized.&quot;</p><p>Spokesperson Liu Pengyu for the ‌Chinese Embassy in Washington said the &quot;analysis&quot; by the FDD was &quot;groundless.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Chinese ⁠government consistently opposes and combats the use of fake accounts and other tactics to manipulate public opinion or spread disinformation,&quot; Liu said in a statement to Reuters.</p><p>&quot;We urge the relevant parties to stop making unfounded accusations and smearing others based on speculation.&quot;</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Riofrio identified the most recent campaign as a distinct ⁠cluster based on its pro-China narratives that has coordinated on messaging content containing overlapping hashtags and other similarities. The cluster is likely part of long-running Chinese information operations that internet security analysts have dubbed Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, she said.</p><p>Although engagement with the material is low, users do see the content in social media feeds and the operators work algorithms to boost the content. One tweet that accused Takaichi of being in ​a ​cult, for example, received only two likes but was viewed more than 1,000 times.</p><p>The activity demonstrates &quot;China has the ​political will to interfere in Japanese elections and internal affairs,&quot; Riofrio said, ‌noting that the overall cluster has similar operations targeting other countries, including the United States.</p><p>The FDD is a Washington-based nonprofit focused on &quot;strengthening U.S. national security and reducing or eliminating threats posed by adversaries and enemies of the United States and other free nations,&quot; according to its website.</p><p>ATTACKS ON TRUMP, ASIA-PACIFIC NATIONS</p><p>The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier this week on another set of suspected foreign-backed online operations attacking the Japanese elections.</p><p>Riofrio said nearly half of the 327 accounts attacked U.S. President Donald Trump, pushing the narrative that his drug and border policies have worsened America&#39;s fentanyl crisis, reversing gains made during the Biden era, while also deflecting blame from China, according to the FDD analysis.</p><p>In a coordinated sequence of messaging in early February on Trump and fentanyl, six accounts, despite having fewer ‌than 10 followers each, attracted hundreds of likes, retweets and replies and nearly 18,000 views as of February ​12, Riofrio said.</p><p>One account in the network, FentanylFreeA, created in December 2025, Riofrio said, seemingly seeks to emulate the ​U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s Fentanyl Free America campaign, using a similar name and identical ​imagery. The account attacks both the U.S. and India, which it blames as the source of fentanyl precursor drugs.</p><p>Neither the White House or the DEA responded ‌to a request for comment.</p><p>The operations known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge have ​been active since at least 2017 and have ​repeatedly targeted audiences around the world over the years, according to experts.</p><p>A spokesperson for Google’s Threat Intelligence Group said Dragonbridge is the most prolific pro-PRC information operations operator that it tracks as of early 2026 based on “its massive scale and assertive narrative agenda.”</p><p>Dragonbridge, while maintaining a foundational focus on targeting the U.S., overseas dissidents, government critics and international NGOs, ​has become notably more assertive in the Asia-Pacific, the Google spokesperson ‌said, including by targeting the political leadership of Japan, Japan-Taiwan relations, Vietnam over its South China Sea activities, India and the Philippine administration.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/openai/\" data-ylk=\"slk:OpenAI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">OpenAI</a> on Wednesday reported that ​it had disrupted attempts in mid-October by a Chinese law enforcement official to help plan a multi-stage information attack on Takaichi.</p><p>(Reporting by AJ Vicens in Detroit; Additional ​reporting by Kentaro Sugiyama and Hina Suzuki in Tokyo; Editing by Chris Sanders and Tom Hogue)</p></div></article></div>",

global superconnector\" and \"regained its position as the world's leading venue for IPOs\" (Peter PARKS)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Hong Kong&#39;s stock exchange reported record profits for the second consecutive year on Thursday, after the finance hub topped the global rankings for initial public offerings in 2025.</p><p>Profit attributable to shareholders rose 36 percent to US$2.3 billion, while total revenue and other income jumped 30 percent to also hit a peak of US$3.7 billion.</p><p>Core business revenue climbed 32 percent from the previous year, thanks to increases in trading and clearing fees driven by record volumes across capital markets.</p><p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) chairman Carlson Tong said the performance was driven by &quot;strong interest and increasing participation of international and Chinese Mainland investors, amid the ongoing dynamic macro backdrop&quot;.</p><p>&quot;In 2025, HKEx reinforced its role as a global superconnector, regained its position as the world&#39;s leading venue for IPOs and set new trading as well as financial performance records,&quot; chief executive Bonnie Chan said.</p><p>The firm expects volatility to &quot;persist amid the prevailing macro landscape in 2026&quot;, she added.</p><p>But she said there was cause for optimism in capital markets as global investors seek diversification and risk management opportunities in Asian and Chinese assets.</p><p>HKEx&#39;s net investment income is expected to be affected in part by interest rate movement and the redemptions from the external portfolio, Herbert Hui, the exchange&#39;s chief financial officer, said Thursday.</p><p>- Behind the surge -</p><p>Hong Kong&#39;s IPO market welcomed 119 new listings and raised a total of US$36.7 billion in 2025, a 226 percent year-over-year increase.</p><p>Dozens of companies from China piled into the city last year to raise overseas capital thanks to policy support from Beijing and optimised listing rules by Hong Kong regulators.</p><p>The renewed interest in Chinese assets is partly because investors are seeking alternatives outside of the US market and are realising &quot;that the performance of some sectors in China aren&#39;t as bad as the feeble wider economy suggest&quot;, China-focused economist Kelvin Lam told AFP.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>But over exposure to Chinese companies may pose potential risk to Hong Kong&#39;s equity market, as they &quot;can be volatile at times through policy and regulatory changes, sometimes not very transparent,&quot; said Lam, who works for Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p><p>The exchange operator is processing more than 400 listing applications, HKEx&#39;s database shows.</p><p>Amid the surge, Hong Kong&#39;s market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said in late January it had directed 13 IPO sponsors to conduct internal reviews to &quot;rectify serious deficiencies&quot; in preparing listing documents.</p><p>The related behaviours also include sponsors&#39; misconduct and significant mismanagement of resources.</p><p>The contacted sponsors are handling 70 percent of IPO applications in Hong Kong.</p><p>Earlier this month, exchange head Bonnie Chan told reporters the review request was a &quot;friendly reminder&quot; from the regulators.</p><p>She said Thursday that HKEx will continue to roll out listing rules to &quot;support the development of the real economy&quot;.</p><p>HKEx is also dedicated to improving its market&#39;s structure and efficiency, including shortening stock clearing time, she said.</p><p>She added the bourse operator would &quot;carefully consider&quot; market calls to broaden the scope of confidential IPO filings. She did not provide details.</p><p>In his annual budget on Wednesday, the city&#39;s finance chief Paul Chan said the exchange would continue to explore establishing a multi‑asset post‑trade securities platform to cover China and Hong Kong equity and debt markets.</p><p>Shares in HKEx were up 0.78 percent on Thursday.</p><p>twa/lga</p></div></article></div>",

after a court jailed him on separate national security charges (Alex OGLE)</figcaption></div></figure><p>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai won an appeal on Thursday over a 2022 fraud conviction, days after a court jailed him on separate national security charges.</p><p>The ruling was a surprise win for Lai, the 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, who was sentenced to 20 years behind bars this month on collusion charges under a Beijing-imposed national security law.</p><p>The fraud case grew out of a contractual dispute and was unrelated to the charges he faced under the security law.</p><p>Lai did not appear in court and remains behind bars.</p><p>&quot;(We) allow the appeals, quash the convictions and set aside the sentences,&quot; High Court Chief Judge Jeremy Poon said, adding that he granted Lai&#39;s application not to show up in court.</p><p>The Department of Justice will study the ruling &quot;thoroughly in order to consider lodging an appeal&quot;, a government spokesperson said.</p><p>In 2022, Lai received a jail sentence of five years and nine months over what the trial judge called a &quot;planned, organised and years-long&quot; scheme.</p><p>It remains unclear how Thursday&#39;s outcome affects Lai&#39;s overall prison stint.</p><p>The tycoon received 20 years in his national security case, with two of those years designed to overlap with his fraud case sentence -- which has now been quashed.</p><p>Lai&#39;s two-decade penalty was by far the harshest under Hong Kong&#39;s national security law, which Beijing imposed in 2020 after huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.</p><p>Critics, including the United States, Britain, the European Union and advocacy groups, said that the lengthy jail term would be &quot;effectively a death sentence&quot; for Lai.</p><p>The mogul has been behind bars since 2020 and spent much of that time in solitary confinement, which authorities said was arranged at his own request to avoid harassment.</p><p>His supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison, although authorities maintain he receives &quot;adequate&quot; care.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>- &#39;Unsupportable&#39; -</p><p>In the fraud case, prosecutors said at trial that a consultancy firm Lai operated for his personal use had taken up office space that Apple Daily had rented for the purposes of publication and printing.</p><p>This was in breach of the terms of the lease Apple Daily signed with a government company and amounted to fraud, prosecutors said.</p><p>In addition to his jail term, Lai was fined HK$2 million ($256,000) and banned from managing companies for eight years.</p><p>But the appeal judges ruled on Thursday that &quot;the prosecution has failed to prove that the applicants had made the false representation as alleged&quot;, adding that the trial judge&#39;s reasoning was &quot;unsupportable&quot;.</p><p>The Hong Kong government spokesperson on Thursday insisted that &quot;the objective fact remains that (Lai) has exploited public resources for private use&quot; even if that fell short of fraud.</p><p>Former Apple Daily executive Wong Wai-keung was also convicted in the same case and has already finished serving a 21-month prison term.</p><p>Wong&#39;s conviction and sentence were also quashed on Thursday.</p><p>hol/fox</p></div></article></div>",

pointing to a continuing trend of strong enthusiasm among the party’s base.</p><p>Through Tuesday, about 850,000 ballots had been cast in the Democratic primary, according to data from the Associated Press. That’s nearly 60% more than the number of votes cast at the same point in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, the last statewide primary in Texas to feature a major competitive Democratic contest.</p><p>It’s also more than the entire advance turnout and over double the number of votes cast on the equivalent day in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial and 2024 Democratic presidential primaries. Many of the more populous counties exceeded their entire primary turnout for those years with several days of early voting and Election Day remaining.</p><p>On the Republican side, advance turnout was about 15% higher than it was at this point in 2022 and slightly trailed turnout one week out from the 2024 primary. It was also slightly ahead of Republican turnout at this point in 2020, when Donald Trump faced only marginal opposition.</p><p>There’s growing evidence of a Democratic advantage in motivation to vote since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Democratic turnout was much higher than Republican turnout in the 2008 presidential primaries, and voters split roughly evenly in casting their ballots in the 2020 primaries.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\">Story continues</button></div><p>Each year featured a highly competitive race on the Democratic side but less of one on the Republican side by the time Texas voted, which boosted relative turnout in the Democratic primaries. Both the Democratic and Republican Senate primaries are competitive this year.</p><p>So far, about 54% of votes cast in this year’s primaries have been on the Democratic side. That ratio far outpaces the Democratic pace of casting votes in 2022 or 2024. Early votes tend to tilt slightly more Democratic than Election Day votes do, and in both of those years, the final electorate (including Election Day ballots) was about 2 points less Democratic relative to the early vote at this point.</p><p>If this year’s vote follows the same trend, a narrow majority of Texas primary voters would have cast their ballots in the Democratic over the Republican primary.</p><p>Even if the primary surge in Democratic participation holds through next Tuesday, the pattern may not hold in the much higher turnout general election. Primaries tend to attract the most enthusiastic voters, while the electorate expands in general elections. In 2008, the Democratic presidential primary had double the turnout of the Republican primary – and Democrat Barack Obama went on to lose the state to Republican John McCain by double digits.</p><h3>Democratic turnout is also strong in Arkansas and North Carolina</h3><figure class=caas-figure><div class=caas-figure-with-pb style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=padding-bottom:56%><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP\" data-src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OcaNdIHf39Sq8X1_.jNxDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ed3a35729a7487d43b4f81fd84c4c4f0><noscript><img alt=\"Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP\" src=https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OcaNdIHf39Sq8X1_.jNxDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/ed3a35729a7487d43b4f81fd84c4c4f0 class=caas-img></noscript></div></div></div><div class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><figcaption class=caption-collapse>Republican US Senate candidate Michael Whatley, second from left, and his wife Suzanne cast their votes at an early voting site on February 12, in Gastonia, North Carolina. - Erik Verduzco/AP</figcaption></div></figure><p>Voters are also casting votes in Arkansas and North Carolina ahead of Tuesday, and signs point to an increase in Democratic turnout relative to past races.</p><p>Roughly a quarter million votes had been cast in North Carolina’s Democratic Senate primary through Tuesday, up over 50% relative to the equivalent day in 2022. Turnout was up a more modest 8% in the Republican Senate primary, though the GOP race is expected to be less competitive this year than it was in 2022.</p><p>Registered Democrats had cast more ballots than registered Republicans (42% to 28%, with the remaining 30% of voters unaffiliated). This 14-point gap was up from 8 points on the equivalent day in 2022 (41% to 33%). Unaffiliated voters are also more likely to have cast ballots in the Democratic primary: Roughly 55% of unaffiliated voters cast a ballot in the Democratic primary over the Republican primary this year, up from 36% choosing the Democratic ballot in 2022.</p><p>In Arkansas, nearly 40,000 votes had been cast in the Democratic Senate primary through Tuesday (nearly 80% of total advance turnout in 2022, with several days left of early voting to go). Over 80,000 votes had been cast in the Republican primary, just under 50% of the 2022 total advance vote.</p><p>For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\">CNN.com</a></p></div></article></div>",
