In fact, the $91 billion spent on stock buybacks in its most recent fiscal year was a deceleration from the $106 billion spent the previous year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hotly Debated</strong></h2>\n<p>Stock buybacks remain a hotly debated subject among investors. Critics claim that share repurchases artificially boost a company's stock, and that the money would be better spent reinvested in the company or providing dividend payments to shareholders. </p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apples-aapl-iphone-air-is-available-for-pre-order-in-china-starting-oct-17\">fans of stock buybacks</a>, including famed investor Warren Buffett, say that there's nothing wrong with companies such as Apple repurchasing their shares. According to Buffett, who owns roughly 2% of Apple and is among the company's largest stockholders, share repurchases give investors a larger percentage ownership in a business without requiring them to spend more money.</p>\n<p>\"If a management wishes to further intensify our ownership by repurchasing shares, we applaud,\" Buffett has said in the past. However, critics would also like to see Apple invest more of its free cash flow, notably in AI. Apple's capital expenditures over the past fiscal year totaled $12.7 billion, a fraction of the $92 billion being spent by Google parent company Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> as it ramps up <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> investments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AAPL Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Apple has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 35 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 20 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">average AAPL price target&nbsp;</a>of $264.07 implies 2.83% downside from current levels.</p>",

In fact, the company already has a large neocloud contract and experience in building high-performance computing systems at scale, which gives it an edge over its competitors. The analysts also stated that Core Scientific can now offer its extra capacity to the highest bidder, which could boost earnings and benefit shareholders more than if the deal with CoreWeave had gone through. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CORZ Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on CORZ stock based on 13 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

However, revenue is forecast to reach $40.49 million, reflecting more than 60% year-over-year growth.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, SoundHound expects full-year revenue to surge 89%â€“110%, reaching between $160 million and $178 million. The revenue growth reflects rising demand for the company's voice AI technology and its expanding product portfolio. While the company remains unprofitable, its strong revenue growth and improving <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/3-reasons-investors-should-watch-soundhound-ai-stock-soun-for-long-term-gains\">outlook suggest promising potential</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is SOUN Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/soun\">SOUN shares</a> have soared over 60% in the last six months but remain volatile, highlighting the risks of their rapid rise. The recent rally has brought the stock closer to analysts' average price targets, limiting near-term upside. However, for long-term investors, SoundHound's outlook and expanding AI footprint remain compelling. A solid Q3 performance could further lift investor confidence and renew momentum in the stock.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, four-star-rated analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/scott-buck\">Scott Buck</a>&nbsp;of H.C.

Additionally, revenue is forecast to come in at around $31.81 million, marking a year-over-year decline of more than 20%. In the previous quarter, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/bbai-earnings-bigbear-ai-stock-crashes-23-on-huge-q2-miss\">revenue fell 18% year over year to $32.5 million</a>, mainly due to reduced activity in certain Army programs.</p>\n<p>The company expects full-year 2025 revenue to range between $125 million and $140 million.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Big Bear a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>In contrast to SOUN, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bbai\">BBAI stock </a>has experienced an even steeper rally, soaring 96% over the last six months and rising 50% year-to-date. However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bbai/financials\">its financial performance</a> continues to trail SoundHound, reflecting weaker growth momentum.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, BigBear.ai has a strong foothold in national security and defense, with its AI technology used in U.S. Navy submarine projects and airport facial recognition systems.

Following the impact of lockdowns on auto supply chains and key components like semi-conductors, there was a drop in the number of new cars being built in the U.S. and a surge in demand for used cars.</p>\n<p>This squeeze led to an increase in prices with, according to car shopping website Edmunds, a 3-year-old used vehicle climbing from around $20,000 in early 2020 to just over $30,000 in early 2025.</p>\n<p>The growth was so strong that commentators warned a 'used car bubble' had been formed. But there are signs that this bubble is finally about to break.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Used Bubble Bursts</strong></h2>\n<p>Figures from Cox Automotive show that nationwide, dealers â€“ both franchised and independent â€“ had a total supply of 2.26 million used vehicles on their lots at the beginning of October. That figure was 3% higher than the 2.21 million in early September and is 10% higher than the same time last year.</p>\n<p>In addition, the average days to turn â€” the number of days a vehicle sits on a dealer lot before a sale â€” for used vehicles is now around 38 days, four more days than a year ago.</p>\n<p>Adding to the gloom, used retail sales&nbsp;were at 1.42 million vehicles&nbsp;in September, down from the 1.50 million reported in August.</p>\n<p>Despite <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> uncertainty, in contrast, Cox Automotive has forecast that there will be 1.30 million sales of new cars in October, up from 1.26 million in September.</p>\n<p>That's been helped by sales of EVs which accelerated before the $7,500 tax credits expired at the end of September. Indeed, EV sales volumes in the U.S. hit an all-time high&nbsp;in Q3 2025, reaching 438,487 units sold.</p>\n<p>Other factors behind the new car resurgence include supply chains now back into gear post-Covid and more driver incentives on offer.</p>\n<p>Figures from Edmunds show that value is another factor with the gap between used and new car prices moving to under $17,000 for the first time since 2022.</p>\n<p>The recent Consumer Price Index figures also show the demand trend with used car prices down 0.4% and new cars up 0.2% in September.</p>\n<p>As Russell pointed out America's existing fleet of cars are also beginning to show their age. The average age of vehicles in the US continues to climb, reaching 12.8 years in 2025, according to analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility.</p>\n<p>Despite the resurgence in new car sales, a relatively stable 4.5% scrappage rate means that older vehicles are staying on the road longer, steadily increasing the average age of the fleet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That reduces their value and increases maintenance and wear and tear costs for drivers spluttering from their home down to the shopping mall.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stocks Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>The shift in gears back to new vehicles is expected to keep some U.S. auto stocks humming but leaving others rusting in the side road.</p>\n<p>General Motors <a data-ticker=\"GM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gm\">(GM)</a>, whose brands include Cadillac and GMC, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gm\">is up</a> over 50% in the last 6 months, with Ford <a data-ticker=\"F\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f\">(F)</a> up 32%, and Stellantis <a data-ticker=\"STLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stla\">(STLA)</a>, home to Chrysler and Dodge, up 7%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>According to Merendi, BofA expects TSLA stock to react unfavorably if shareholders reject the proposal and Musk resigns or devotes more attention to his other businesses. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will Rejection of the $1T Pay Proposal Hurt Tesla?</strong></h2>\n<p>The latest comment comes days after <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/robyn-denholm\">Robyn Denholm</a>, Tesla's board chair, similarly <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-could-lose-musk-if-1t-pay-package-is-struck-down-warns-board-chair\">warned in a letter to investors</a> that Musk walking away could result in significant loss of value for the automaker. Denholm noted that many investors consider the billionaire chief executive's leadership as central to the company's future.</p>\n<p>The board's hefty compensation package hinges on Musk leading the company&nbsp;to reach certain <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-tsla-plans-1-trilion-payout-for-elon-musk-if-ambitious-goals-are-met\">ambitious milestones</a> over the next 10 years. This includes progressively expanding its market capitalization to $8.5 trillion and selling millions of the company's robotaxis and Optimus robots. </p>\n<p>Denholm <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-tsla-plans-1-trilion-payout-for-elon-musk-if-ambitious-goals-are-met\">previously </a><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-tsla-plans-1-trilion-payout-for-elon-musk-if-ambitious-goals-are-met\" target=\"_blank\">emphasized</a> that</span> \"retaining and incentivizing Elon is fundamental to Teslaâ€¦becoming the most valuable company in history.\" However, the proposal <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-this-massive-pension-fund-is-voting-against-musks-1t-tesla-tsla-pay-package\">has faced staunch criticism</a> since it was put forward in early September, including from a \"Take Back Tesla\" campaign initiated by a group of unions and watchdog organizations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Elon Musk Wants 'Strong Influence' over Tesla</strong></h2>\n<p>Amid the criticism, pension fund and activist investor <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-this-massive-pension-fund-is-voting-against-musks-1t-tesla-tsla-pay-package\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">CalPERS</span> reportedly plans to vote against</a> the payment package. This is even as Musk, during the company's recent third-quarter earnings call last week, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-q3-earnings-key-takeways-as-tsla-stock-slides\">fired back at critics</a>, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-q3-earnings-key-takeways-as-tsla-stock-slides\">calling them \"corporate terrorists.\"</a></p>\n<p>Musk continues to emphasize that he would need sufficient voting power â€” which the package would give him â€” to maintain \"a strong influence\" as he leads Tesla's expansion into AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. </p>\n<p>This voting power should be around \"mid-20s\", he recently pointed out, adding that he needs to remain fireable if he goes \"insane.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">Tesla's shares</a> currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating from analysts. This is based on 14 Buys, 10 Holds, and 10 Sells issued by 34 analysts over the past three months. </p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">the average TSLA price target</a> of $395.54 indicates nearly 13% downside risk from the current level.</p>",
