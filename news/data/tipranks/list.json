            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>It is worth noting that Ives ranks 338 out of more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. He has a success rate of 56%, with an average return per rating of 16.40% over a one-year timeframe.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wedbush Sees Continued Upside in AMD Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives, a 5-star analyst, reiterated an Outperform rating on AMD with a $270 price target, indicating potential upside of about 2%. He believes AMD is well positioned to benefit from rising AI spending, supported by strong demand for its MI300 chips. Wedbush's research shows growing adoption of these chips among large cloud and enterprise customers, helping AMD gain share in the fast-expanding AI market.</p>\n<p>The firm kept AMD on its \"Ives AI 30\" list of top AI stocks, calling it a core pick for investors seeking long-term exposure to AI growth.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, AMD will announce its third-quarter results on November 4. Wall Street expects the company's <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/earnings\">earnings per share (EPS) to rise 27.2% to $1.17</a>, while revenue is projected to increase 28.3% to $8.75 billion, driven by strong demand for AI processors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ives Remains Cautious on SMCI Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives maintained a Neutral rating on Super Micro Computer <a data-ticker=\"SMCI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci\">(SMCI)</a> with a $48 price target, reflecting a more cautious view after its sharp rally this year. SMCI has been one of the top gainers in the AI hardware space, with shares up about 72% year-to-date, fueled by heavy demand for its AI servers and close ties with Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> and AMD <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a>.</p>\n<p>The analyst noted that SMCI's long-term growth still depends on the ongoing AI data center buildout, but at current prices, the risk-to-reward looks less appealing than other AI hardware names. The company will need to show steady growth and stable margins in coming quarters to support its high valuation.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Super Micro will report its Q1 FY26 results on November 4. Wall Street expects the company's <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast\">earnings per share (EPS) to fall 49% year-over-year to $0.38</a>, while revenue is projected to edge down 2% to $5.83 billion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Is the Best AI Stock, According to Wall Street?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Using TipRanks' Stock Comparison Tool, we reviewed how analysts rate the two AI hardware stocks. AMD carries a \"Moderate Buy\" consensus with a 5.45% downside based on an average price target of $249.92. In contrast, Super Micro holds a \"Hold\" rating, with analysts expecting a 16.21% downside.</p>\n<p>AMD also stands out with a perfect <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a> of 10, signaling strong fundamentals and bullish sentiment, while SMCI scores 3, reflecting a more cautious analyst outlook.</p>",

Moreover, the bottom line was better than <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wolf/earnings\">the Street's expectation of an adjusted loss per share of $0.71</a>. However, WOLF's Q1 FY26 adjusted gross margin contracted significantly to -26% from 3% in the prior-year quarter. The company reported a rise in underutilization costs related to its Mohawk Valley and Siler City facilities to $47 million from $26 million in Q1 FY25. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>CEO Robert Feurle stated that the company is aligning its business with near-term challenges while advancing into new, high-growth applications such as <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) data centers, aerospace, and energy storage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WOLF Issues Weak Q2 Guidance</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Wolfspeed expects a sequential decline in revenue, with Q2 FY26 top line projected in the range of $150 million to $190 million.</p>\n<p>The company explained that the sequential decline in Q2 FY26 revenue is expected due to accelerated customer purchases in the fiscal first quarter, as some customers built up inventory by placing orders from the Durham fab prior to its planned closure at year-end. Wolfspeed added that some customers pursued \"second-sourcing of products during the pendency of its bankruptcy process.\"</p>\n<p>Moreover, Wolfspeed is facing softness in the market, which it expects to continue through Fiscal 2026. It is seeing slow orders from automakers and increasing competition from larger rivals, such as STMicroelectronics <a data-ticker=\"STM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stm\">(STM)</a> and Infineon <a data-ticker=\"IFNNF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ifnnf\">(IFNNF)</a>. The company stated that it plans to provide a comprehensive financial update in the first half of calendar year 2026. Wolfspeed clarified that it will not be updating its long-term model or guidance before then.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Wolfspeed Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Wolfspeed filed for Chapter 11 protection in June and emerged from bankruptcy in September after reducing its debt by about 70%.</p>\n<p>Currently, Wolfspeed carries a Hold rating from Susquehanna analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/christopher-rolland\">Christopher Rolland</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wolf/forecast\">price target of $30</a> indicates a 6.2% downside risk from current levels. However, this rating/price target might change in reaction to the Q1 FY26 results and outlook.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia Brings Quantum and AI Together</strong></h3>\n<p>Naturally, we begin with Nvidia's new reveal: NVQLink, an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-nvda-expands-into-quantum-computing-with-nvqlink-as-stock-climbs\">open system that connects quantum processors</a> directly to its GPU-based supercomputers. The system is designed to handle real-time control and error correction, two key tasks for making quantum computers work reliably.</p>\n<p>Chief Executive Jensen Huang described NVQLink as the bridge that links quantum and classical computing into one system. He said every Nvidia GPU-powered supercomputer will soon use this setup, allowing both types of machines to work side by side.</p>\n<p>The project involves 17 quantum hardware companies, five control-system builders, and nine U.S. national labs. Partners include Quantinuum, IonQ <a data-ticker=\"IONQ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq\">(IONQ)</a>, Rigetti Computing <a data-ticker=\"RGTI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rgti\">(RGTI)</a>, and Pasqal, as well as hardware providers like Quantum Machines and Keysight Technologies <a data-ticker=\"KEYS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/keys\">(KEYS)</a>. The U.S. Department of Energy said NVQLink supports its plan to keep the country ahead in high-performance computing.</p>\n<p>The system will also work with CUDA-Q, Nvidia's software for hybrid computing. That means developers can now design algorithms that use CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs all at once.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Industry Partners Line Up</strong></h3>\n<p>Following Nvidia's launch, several companies announced new steps. Pasqal said it is linking its neutral-atom quantum processors with NVQLink to build more stable logical qubits. This move supports its plan for scalable, hybrid quantum-<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/quantum-computing-news-global-race-heats-up-as-ibm-btq-and-china-advance-practical-quantum-systems\">Alice &amp; Bob, based in France</a>, said it is using NVQLink to speed up fault-tolerant computing. The system lets its devices run calibration and decoding tasks faster by using Nvidia GPUs for live data processing.</p>\n<p>Quantum Machines, an Israeli firm, said it has updated its DGX Quantum platform to support NVQLink. The new setup allows data to move between quantum processors and GPUs in microseconds. This tight link could help speed up error correction and improve quantum control.</p>\n<p>In Australia, Diraq said it is working with Sandia National Labs to use NVQLink for real-time calibration of its silicon qubits. The project combines machine learning with quantum control, showing how NVIDIA's system could become a standard for industry research.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quantum Moves to the Factory Floor</strong></h3>\n<p>Beyond the Nvidia news, a new report from the World Economic Forum and Accenture (ACN) highlights how quantum technology <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/quantum-tech-moves-from-lab-to-the-factory-floor-how-ford-tsmc-and-boeing-are-already-using-it\">is already being used in real-world industries</a>.</p>\n<p>Boeing <a data-ticker=\"BA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba\">(BA)</a> used quantum simulations to study corrosion, cutting computation time by up to 85%. Ford Otosan <a data-ticker=\"F\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f\">(F)</a> applied hybrid quantum algorithms to scheduling tasks and cut production time by 50%. TSMC <a data-ticker=\"TSM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm\">(TSM)</a> is using quantum sensors to detect chip defects earlier in the process.</p>\n<p>The report warns that firms must act soon to prepare for \"quantum-safe\" security, since new quantum computers could eventually break current encryption systems. Governments and companies are already testing new standards and tools to guard against that risk.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Quantum Startups and Space Hardware</strong></h3>\n<p>In Europe, SemiQon joined the European Space Agency's business program to adapt its cryogenic CMOS chip technology for satellites and exploration vehicles. The company says its chips use less power and could extend battery life in space by up to 50%.</p>\n<p>At the same time, QAI Ventures launched a new accelerator in Singapore to support startups building products that mix <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/quantum-computing\">quantum computing</a> with AI. The program, backed by Enterprise Singapore, will open applications through early 2026 and target up to seven new companies by 2027.</p>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=TSM&amp;ticker=BA&amp;ticker=F&amp;ticker=IONQ&amp;ticker=RGTI&amp;ticker=NVDA&amp;ticker=IBM&amp;ticker=GOOG&amp;ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=QUBT\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to line up leading quantum stocks with the tickers mentioned in this piece.

However, the company moved quickly, issuing an over-the-air software update to fix the issue at no cost to drivers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What It Could Mean for TSLA Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>The news adds another setback for TSLA stock, which remains in the spotlight following the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-q3-earnings-key-takeways-as-tsla-stock-slides\">Q3 earnings miss</a> and CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/elon-musk\">Elon Musk's</a> pay <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/tesla-prepared-to-name-internal-ceo-should-musk-exit-board-chair-says-thefly\">package controversy</a>.</p>\n<p>At the same time, this may deepen concerns among analysts and investors about the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-slashes-cybertruck-production-goals-in-latest-nightmare-for-tsla-investors\">Cybertruck's ability to strengthen Tesla's market position</a>. Some experts have long questioned whether the vehicle's unconventional design and repeated technical issues could hinder its mass-market appeal. Many even believe that winding down the model might ultimately benefit Tesla's stock, freeing up resources for more profitable projects.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Cybertruck's continued issues could hurt investor confidence and put more pressure on TSLA stock.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Sets Stage for Cybercab's Big Asia-Pacific Debut</strong></h2>\n<p>In separate news, Tesla announced that it is set to showcase its highly anticipated self-driving EV, Cybercab, at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, scheduled from November 5–10. The event will mark the robotaxi's official debut in the Asia-Pacific region, signaling Tesla's push to expand its autonomous vehicle ambitions beyond the U.S. market.</p>\n<p>Notably, Musk unveiled the autonomous Cybercab last year. It was softly launched in Austin this June with limited, invite-only access and human safety drivers on board. The company expects to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/tesla-cybercab-tesla-semi-on-schedule-for-2026-volume-production-thefly\">begin mass production next year</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">TSLA stock</a> has received a Hold consensus rating, with 14 Buys, 11 Holds, and 10 Sells assigned in the last three months.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Revenues of $102.35 billion represented year-over-year growth of 16%, and also beat expectations by a cool $2.21 billion. Moreover, its EPS GAAP of $2.87 beat estimates by a whopping $0.61, or 27% greater than expectations.</p>\n<p>Growth came in many different shapes and sizes. Google Search, the company's biggest cash cow, grew by 14.5% year-over-year, bringing in $56.57 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, Google Cloud grew by 33.5%, reaching $15.16 billion in sales.</p>\n<p>GOOGL's share price has now gained over 70% during the course of the last six months. On the heels of such rapid growth, should investors take a time out? Not according to top investor Jonathan Weber, who sees more dollar signs ahead.</p>\n<p>\"Alphabet's strong fundamentals and reasonable valuation make [the] stock one of the most attractive big tech investments today,\" says the 5-star investor, who is among the top 2% of stock pros covered by TipRanks.</p>\n<p>Weber is very encouraged by the strong revenues, and notes that the 16% increase is the largest quarterly jump in over three years. That Alphabet is able to deliver such robust numbers is all the more impressive.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is remarkable that this very established business that has been active for many years is still doing this well, growth-wise, and it seems pretty clear by now that <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence</a> isn't hurting Google's search business,\" adds Weber.</p>\n<p>And, it certainly appears that momentum is on Alphabet's side, as Google Cloud now has a backlog of $155 billion. While capex is high, so are free cash flows, which Weber points out total $49 billion year-to-date.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Alphabet's earnings multiple makes it cheaper than most of its Magnificent 7 peers, making this a \"good value\" investment.</p>\n<p>\"I thus remain bullish on Alphabet for its strong growth, excellent wide-moat business model, and still quite appealing valuation on a relative basis,\" sums up Weber, who rates GOOGL a Strong Buy. (To watch Jonathan Weber's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/jonathan-weber\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>One won't find too much disagreement on Wall Street, where 28 Buys and 8 Holds combine to give GOOGL a Strong Buy consensus rating. Its 12-month average price target of $267.53 implies minimal losses going forward, meaning that some analysts may be revisiting their assessments in the near future.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Ives said Palantir has a \"golden path\" ahead and could become the next Oracle <a data-ticker=\"ORCL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/orcl\">(ORCL)</a> over the coming years. He noted that Palantir is improving its products, adding top talent, and expanding worldwide, strengthening its position as a major player in the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> space.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Highlights Growing AIP Demand</strong></h2>\n<p>The 5-star analyst said Palantir remains \"at the forefront of the AI race\" as more companies and government agencies adopt its AIP tools. He noted that demand is strong because the platform helps users apply AI to make quicker and better decisions.</p>\n<p>Based on Wedbush's research, Ives said AIP is helping Palantir win new clients and expand deals with current ones. He believes Wall Street's forecasts for Q3 are too low and that Palantir could beat expectations as its commercial business keeps growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Partnerships Strengthen Palantir's AI Reach</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives pointed to Palantir's new partnerships as key growth drivers. The company's deal with Snowflake <a data-ticker=\"SNOW\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/snow\">(SNOW)</a> connects Snowflake's AI Data Cloud with Palantir's Foundry and AIP platforms, allowing customers to build AI models faster and more securely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-nvda-strengthens-ai-leadership-through-new-deals-with-uber-and-palantir-pltr\">Palantir also announced a new partnership with Nvidia</a> <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> to bring Nvidia's Blackwell architecture into its AIP system. This will help improve AI performance for both enterprise and government clients using Palantir's software.</p>\n<p>Ives said these alliances put Palantir in a strong position to win more enterprise AI deals. He expects U.S. commercial revenue to grow more than 85% in fiscal 2025, supported by steady AIP adoption and rising demand across industries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Government Deals Boost PLTR's Federal Strength</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives has also underlined Palantir's ongoing strength in government contracts. The company recently expanded its work with the UK Armed Forces <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/palantir-and-hadean-announce-partnership-thefly\">through a partnership with Hadean</a>, using Foundry for advanced defense simulations.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The U.S. agreed to lower <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-trade-u-s-to-impose-100-additional-tariff-on-chinese-goods-thefly\">some tariffs on Chinese goods.</a> The change includes cutting the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on items linked to fentanyl production from 20% to 10%. In return, China will tighten its control over the export of the chemicals used to make the drug. Trump said China is now taking \"very strong action\" on the issue. The cut will also bring the average tariff on Chinese <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> down to 47% from 57%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trade, Agriculture, and Rare Earths</strong></h2>\n<p>The two sides also found a path <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/rare-earth-stocks-surge-as-trump-revives-u-s-mining-push\">on rare-earth exports</a>. These materials are key in products from <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/electric-vehicles\">electric vehicle</a> motors to medical gear. China plans to delay new export limits for one year, which should ease pressure on U.S. manufacturers. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said the \"roadblock\" to rare-earth imports is now gone. Still, analysts expect China to keep some control measures in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-says-china-not-buying-u-s-soybeans-economically-hostile-act-thefly\">China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans</a>. The country purchased several large shipments this week, each holding about two million bushels. That move offers relief to American farmers who have struggled during the harvest season. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said the new purchases are a \"great start\" for producers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Next Steps and Market Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>Trump said a broader trade deal could come \"pretty soon.\" He also noted that the United States will delay plans for new port fees on Chinese-owned or Chinese-built vessels. The change follows <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/150-billion-south-korean-push-aims-to-rebuild-u-s-shipyards\">South Korea's pledge to invest $150 billion in U.S. shipbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>Both leaders described the meeting as friendly. Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi is expected to visit the United States after that.</p>\n<p>For investors, the meeting may bring short-term optimism across global markets. Lower tariffs could benefit logistics and retail firms that rely on imports, while renewed Chinese purchases may lift agricultural stocks such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company <a data-ticker=\"ADM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/adm\">(ADM)</a> and Bunge Global SA <a data-ticker=\"BG\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bg\">(BG)</a>. Companies that use rare-earth materials, such as Tesla Inc. <a data-ticker=\"TSLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">(TSLA)</a>, &nbsp;USA Rare Earth&nbsp;<a data-ticker=\"USAR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/usar\">(USAR)</a>, and Lynas Rare Earths <strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:lyc\">(AU:LYC)</a></strong>, could also see some supply relief if export rules stay loose.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Busan meeting showed that both governments are seeking a calmer trade path after years of tension. Markets will now watch for follow-through on the promises made and any sign of a broader trade deal in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>By using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=TSLA&amp;ticker=BG&amp;ticker=ADM&amp;ticker=USAR&amp;ticker=AU%3ALYC&amp;ticker=MP&amp;ticker=LAC\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>, we've lined up all the companies mentioned in this piece to make it easy for investors to review each stock and see how they stack up across the agricultural and mineral sectors.</p>",
