ARK Invest funds purchased 97,597 BIDU shares for $12.21 million.

In Q4, AI‑powered businesses, including cloud infrastructure, AI apps, and robotaxis, generated $1.61 billion, or 43% of total revenue.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wood's Other Buy/Sell Trades</strong></h2>\n<p>Wood also acquired 482,407 shares of biotechnology company AtaiBeckley <a data-ticker=\"ATAI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/atai\">(ATAI)</a> for roughly $1.79 million. ATAI shares plunged 14.1% yesterday, even though the company released <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/atai-beckley-says-emp-01-met-primary-safety-objectivein-phase-2a-trial-thefly-news\">positive top‑line Phase IIa data for its R‑MDMA</a>‑derived compound EMP‑01 in social anxiety disorder (SAD).

PD stock was up 5% yesterday, resulting in a sale of roughly $2.18 million.</p>\n<p>ARK's other sales included exiting positions in Beam Therapeutics <a data-ticker=\"BEAM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/beam\">(BEAM)</a>, Iridium Communications <a data-ticker=\"IRDM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/irdm\">(IRDM)</a>, Salesforce <a data-ticker=\"CRM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm\">(CRM)</a>, Pinterest <a data-ticker=\"PINS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pins\">(PINS)</a>, and Butterfly Network <a data-ticker=\"BFLY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bfly\">(BFLY)</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is BIDU Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, BIDU stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and two Hold ratings.

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> fell nearly 5% on Thursday, even after delivering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvda-earnings-nvidia-stock-rises-after-topping-estimates\">record-breaking quarterly results.</a> The drop shows investors aren't fully convinced amid a fear of a potential tech bubble and higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spending. The sell-off accelerated after a sharp warning from \"Big Short\" investor <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/hedge-funds/michael-burry\">Michael Burry</a>. In a <em>Substack</em> post, Burry called Nvidia's supply situation \"troubling.\" He added that Nvidia's strong margins are driven by exceptional demand and pricing power, warning that any slowdown could be \"catastrophic\" for earnings and its balance sheet.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>For context, Michael Burry is a renowned investor and hedge fund manager best known for predicting the 2008 housing market crash, as portrayed in the book and film <em>The Big Short.</em> He is known for his bold, contrarian bets in the financial markets and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/michael-burry-issues-bubble-warning-after-two-year-hiatus-is-he-shorting-the-market\">warned about an AI Bubble.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Burry Sees Trouble Brewing at Nvidia</strong></h2>\n<p>The core of Burry's concern is simple but striking. Nvidia's purchase obligations — essentially locked-in supply contracts it cannot cancel — jumped to $95.2 billion, up from just $16.1 billion a year earlier. To simplify, Nvidia is now committed to buying nearly $100 billion worth of chip components before it even knows whether customers will actually need them.</p>\n<p>Burry argues this is a dangerous position. He draws a direct comparison to Cisco Systems <a data-ticker=\"CSCO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/csco\">(CSCO)</a> during the dot-com bubble of 2000 and 2001. Back then, Cisco locked in massive supply orders expecting 50% annual growth to continue forever. When demand unexpectedly fell, Cisco was buried under excess inventory — and its stock eventually lost more than 80% of its value.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/earnings\">Nvidia's total supply obligations now stand at $117 billion</a>, a figure that nearly matches the company's entire annual operating cash flow. Burry said what's happening inside the company's books is \"not business as usual.\"</p>\n<p>Additionally, Burry noted that CFO Colette Kress said inventory rose 8% quarter over quarter and that Nvidia has locked in supply capacity well beyond its usual planning window. For Burry, that's a red flag. He argues Nvidia isn't choosing these long-term, non-cancellable orders — it's being pushed into them by TSMC <a data-ticker=\"TSM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm\">(TSM)</a>, which wants longer commitments and upfront payments to expand capacity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What This Means for NVDA Investors</strong></h2>\n<p>Here's the split that makes this story so fascinating for investors. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-drops-5-despite-record-breaking-results-analyst-says-we-still-view-shares-as-undervalued\">Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish</a> on Nvidia post Q4 earnings. Top analysts at Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, RBC, and more have raised their price targets on NVDA while maintaining Buy ratings. Most analysts see Nvidia's supply commitments as a strength, stating it as a sign that the company is securing its dominance ahead of surging AI demand.</p>\n<p>Burry sees the exact opposite. He believes the market is confusing a supply boom with durable long-term demand, similar to the mistake made during the dot-com era.</p>\n<p>Broadly, Nvidia's fundamentals are still extraordinary. But the post-earnings stock drop signals that investors are at least beginning to ask harder questions about what happens when the AI spending frenzy eventually cools.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">Nvidia stock</a> based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">Nvidia price target of $273.38</a> per share implies 48% upside potential. </p>",

The offer also adds a $0.25‑per‑share ticking fee each quarter after September 30, 2026, which increases the effective price if the transaction closes later than expected.</p>\n<p>Key protections include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Paramount pays a $7 billion termination fee if regulators block the deal, giving WBD shareholders additional downside protection.</li>\n<li>Paramount covers WBD's $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix, removing a major financial overhang tied to the earlier Netflix agreement.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/larry-ellison\">Larry Ellison</a> and his trust add more equity if needed to help satisfy bank solvency rules, ensuring financing remains secure under the terms of the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Will Paramount Face Regulatory Hurdles?</strong></h2>\n<p>Paramount Skydance has already <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/paramount-skydance-clears-u-s-hurdle-in-wbd-deal\">started clearing key regulatory hurdles</a> in both the U.S. and Europe, giving the deal early momentum. In the U.S., the company has reportedly filed the required antitrust paperwork and begun discussions with regulators, which is a standard step for large media deals. It has already secured approval from Germany's foreign investment authorities and will still need clearance from the European Union.</p>\n<p>Strategically, the combination would unite Paramount Skydance, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros.

Rather than raising its bid, Netflix chose not to match the new price.</p>\n<p>Management said the revised terms were no longer financially attractive.

The company intends to continue investing heavily in original content and is expected to spend about $20 billion this year on films and series.

Instead of focusing only on long-term technology potential, investors now want evidence of real revenue and early commercial use.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quarterly Highlights</strong></h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IonQ Stock</strong></h3>\n<p>IonQ delivered a strong quarter and exceeded expectations by a wide margin. The company reported Q4 revenue of $61.9 million, far above estimates of about $40 million. Its adjusted loss was also smaller than expected.</p>\n<p>Guidance was the bigger driver. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/financials\">IonQ forecast first-quarter revenue of $48 million to $51 million</a> and full-year revenue of $225 million to $245 million, both ahead of Wall Street projections. The company also reported full-year 2025 revenue of about $130 million, becoming the first publicly traded quantum computing company to surpass $100 million in annual sales.</p>\n<p>The results suggested customers are beginning to use quantum computing services in real workloads rather than only experimental testing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>D-Wave Quantum Stock</strong></h3>\n<p>D-Wave reported a weaker quarter. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts/financials\">The company posted Q4 revenue of $2.75 million</a>, below estimates of $3.75 million, and a larger-than-expected loss.</p>\n<p>The stock had initially risen in sympathy after IonQ's results but pulled back once D-Wave released its own earnings. Despite the weak quarter, the company announced several developments, including a system sale, defense-related partnerships, and a multi-year quantum computing service agreement with a large corporate customer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sujeeva-de-silva\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sujeeva-de-silva\">Roth Capital analyst Sujeeva De Silva</a> kept a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target, pointing to higher operating expenses after D-Wave's January 2026 agreement to acquire Quantum Circuits, a developer of gate-model quantum hardware. The deal is meant to broaden D-Wave's technology beyond its current annealing systems, though it will raise costs in the near term.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Quantum Computing Stock Looks Stronger?</strong></h2>\n<p>Both companies are early-stage and still unprofitable, but the latest results explain the different market reaction. IonQ's earnings showed clearer revenue growth and reduced uncertainty for investors. D-Wave, meanwhile, highlighted future potential, yet its current revenue remains limited.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/amzn-vs-googl-vs-msft\">TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool</a>, analysts still rate QBTS a Strong Buy with an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts/forecast\">average price target of about $41.82</a>, implying significant upside. Meanwhile IonQ carries a Moderate Buy consensus with an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/forecast\">average price target near $63.82</a>, implying roughly 56% upside from current levels.</p>\n<p>In short, analysts see more valuation upside in D-Wave, but investors are currently favoring IonQ's stronger near-term business momentum.</p>",

However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-earnings-coreweave-stock-drops-on-wider-than-expected-q4-loss\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-earnings-coreweave-stock-drops-on-wider-than-expected-q4-loss\">the company posted a much larger loss of $0.89 per share</a>, which overshadowed the strong top-line growth.</p>\n<p>The report showed no slowdown in customer demand. CoreWeave's contracted backlog rose to about $67 billion, supported by long-term deals with large technology companies building AI products.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Losses and Debt Became the Main Concern</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the strong growth, investors were worried about profitability.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave is expanding rapidly and building data centers across the U.S. To finance that build-out, the company has taken on large borrowings. Its debt and lease obligations have climbed to roughly $30 billion, and interest payments are taking a significant share of revenue.</p>\n<p>Because of those costs, losses widened instead of narrowing. But the market had expected the opposite. Investors expected larger scale to improve margins, but the earnings report suggested profits may still be far away.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guidance Triggered the Selloff</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock reaction was driven more by the outlook than by the reported quarter.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave guided first-quarter revenue to a range of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion, well below Wall Street expectations of about $2.29 billion. The company also projected an operating margin near 8%, signaling profitability remains limited in the near term.</p>\n<p>For full-year 2026, CoreWeave forecast revenue of $12 billion to $13 billion, roughly in line with estimates, but spending is set to rise sharply. The company plans $30 billion to $35 billion in capital expenditures in 2026 as it continues building data-center capacity.</p>\n<p>Together, the outlook showed growth will continue, but heavy spending and low margins suggest profits remain far away.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Investors Will Watch Next</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors will now watch whether losses begin to narrow. They will look at margins, interest expense, and how much the company continues to spend as new data centers come online and start generating revenue.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave is building capacity first and recognizing revenue later, so costs appear immediately while income ramps over time. The next few quarters should show whether that gap starts to close.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CoreWeave a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, CRWV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buy and eight Hold ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave stock price target of $118.57</a>&nbsp;implies 20.72% upside potential. &nbsp;It's worth noting that estimates will likely change following today's earnings report.</p>",

There is the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/disney-serves-legal-notice-demanding-bytedance-to-halt-ai-generated-videos\">growth of artificial intelligence</a> (<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>) that offers serious cost savings, but may well cripple any studio that uses it under the weight of consumer backlash. That does not even factor in what may happen if the regular consumer starts using it instead. Marvel is losing steam. The <em>Star Wars</em> franchise has not had a hit in quite a while, with even the upcoming trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> getting what can be charitably described as mixed reactions.</p>\n<p>This is not one big task; this is several big tasks that are all coming due all at once. But D'Amaro has one thing working for him, a thing some call \"the Josh Effect.\" D'Amaro has a gift for eye contact and making other people feel seen and heard. That is certainly no small gift, but will it be enough to turn doddering franchises into <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/disney-stock-dis-in-focus-as-company-names-new-ceo\">fan favorites</a> and money-makers once more?</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building Goodwill</strong></h2>\n<p>However, Disney might have a bit of goodwill building going on, as it teams up with the Indianapolis Children's Museum to deliver \"Tiana's Joyful Celebration,\" an event that starts in March and runs through to just after New Year's Day 2027.</p>\n<p>The event is built around a narrative of Tiana from The Princess and the Frog—Disney's first Black princess—preparing for a special event in New Orleans. Along the way, the children who go through the exhibit will engage in a slate of hands-on activities designed to \"help out\" with the event. This is actually the third time the museum has collaborated with Disney, following events with <em>Doc McStuffins</em> and the <em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em>. Since this event uses a theatrical release for its basis, it might be considered the biggest such event yet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Disney Stock a Buy or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on DIS stock based on 17 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 5.62% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dis\">loss in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dis/forecast\">average DIS price target</a> of $135.41 per share implies 28.3% upside potential.</p>",
