Despite these headwinds, Autodesk continues to invest heavily in artificial intelligence by using its specialized industry data and software expertise to build advanced <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools designed for engineering and construction workflows. As a result, J.P.

Still, they highlighted that recent results were stronger than expected, with revenue growth of 14% and billings growth of 32%, both well above their forecasts. This performance was supported by strong contract renewals and steady sales patterns, as well as solid growth in future contracted revenue. Looking ahead, Autodesk expects Fiscal 2027 revenue of about $8.1 billion to $8.17 billion, which equates to roughly 12% to 13% growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is ADSK Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on ADSK stock based on 19 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

He stated that while revenue largely came in line with expectations, profitability fell short of estimates.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he stated that the company's guidance for the next period was higher than anticipated, but flagged concerns about how SoundHound will achieve that growth. Specifically, Fish noted that the company may need to pursue aggressive initiatives or mergers and acquisitions to meet its targets, given the current pace of the business.</p>\n<p>Earlier in January 2026, Fish lowered his price target on SOUN from $15 to $11, citing several concerns. Fish was worried about the company's ability to effectively execute its growth plans. This includes managing operations, scaling the business, and hitting financial targets.

This was Samsung's first attempt at mimicking rival Apple's <a data-ticker=\"AAPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">(AAPL)</a> incredibly thin smartphone design philosophy for the iPhone Air. Interestingly, super thin smartphones don't appear to appeal to consumers, as the iPhone Air also didn't perform as well as expected.</p>\n<p>Considering the lukewarm reception to the Galaxy S25 Edge, it makes sense that Samsung would consider dropping the line. It would also allow the company to focus on other developments, such as folding smartphones. These have been growing in popularity, though Samsung may have taken the idea a bit too far with its massive Tri-Fold smartphone, which is on the chopping block alongside the Edge line. One fold appears to be enough for consumers, as two folds are too many.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Samsung Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">Samsung Electronics stock was up 54.05%</a> after the markets closed yesterday.

The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has fallen by nearly 9% over the past year, with Garthwaite predicting that the euro will rise to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Buybacks Cool, Uncertainty Drives U.S. Outflows</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition, the scale of U.S. corporate buybacks has edged lower and is now broadly in line with the rest of the world.

This drastic sell-off happened after the company revealed it would actively slow down its efforts to make money from users in order to keep those users happy and engaged.

While this made the company profitable, it also made the app less enjoyable for free users. As a result, the number of new people joining the app started to slow down in late 2025.<sup></sup></p>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-160\">Management aims to fix this issue by reducing the friction for free learners. Instead of constantly asking users to pay, the company will focus on making the app more fun, which they hope will lead to more people recommending it to friends. Analysts like <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wyatt-swanson\">Wyatt Swanson</a> from D.A. Davidson believe this is a necessary move, writing that previous efforts to monetize had led to \"disgruntled users and a meaningful negative impact to 'word-of-mouth' marketing.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo's Soft Guidance Worries the Market</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-161\">Investors did not take the news well because Duolingo also lowered its financial outlook for 2026. The company now expects revenue to be lower than what Wall Street analysts previously predicted. Even though the company beat revenue estimates for the final quarter of 2025, the promise of slower growth in 2026 was enough to cause the stock crash.</p>\n<p>Analysts on Wall Street are split on the strategy. While <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ratings/duolingo-buy-rating-reaffirmed-as-valuation-disconnects-from-long-term-growth-and-cash-flow-potential-ratings-news\">some understand the long-term goal</a>, others are punishing the stock for the short-term pain. KeyBanc analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-patterson\">Justin Patterson</a> noted that \"While we believe this is the right long-term move, the near-term effect is clear.\" Because of this uncertainty, multiple firms cut their price targets for the stock by a significant amount.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo Plans to Offer More AI Features</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-162\">To achieve its goals, Duolingo plans to offer more of its <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> features, like the popular \"Video Call with Lily,\" to all users rather than keeping them locked behind a paywall. While this will help attract new users, it also costs more money to run those AI servers, which will reduce the company's profit margins this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-163\">To support the stock price during this transition, the company authorized a $400 million share buyback program. This shows leadership believes the stock is undervalued, but it may not be enough to stop the bleeding if the user growth targets are not met quickly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Duolingo a Good Stock to Buy? </strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, Duolingo stock (DUOL) has a Hold consensus rating based on five Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/duol/forecast\">average 12-month DUOL price target</a>&nbsp;of $139.64&nbsp;implies 48.9% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/duol\">DUOL shares have fallen 69%</a>.</p>",
