            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>These coefficients are important in both physics and mathematics, but extremely hard to compute using regular computers. The IBM team believed that this problem fit a new category they called QXC, short for \"quantum approximate counting,\" where <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ibm-and-the-basque-government-open-europes-first-ibm-quantum-system-two\">quantum computers</a> can estimate how many valid solutions exist. By using a version of phase estimation (a quantum algorithm that helps find hidden values linked to how a quantum system behaves), the researchers designed an algorithm that can handle this task far more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the work caused Mathematician Greta Panova from USC to review the findings and challenge the initial claim of a super-polynomial speedup. She ultimately disproved that bold claim but confirmed a smaller, still meaningful advantage: the quantum algorithm outperforms classical ones by a large margin when scaled. As a result, IBM researcher Vojtěch Havlíček believes that this work not only pushes quantum research forward but could also lead to new breakthroughs across both fields.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is IBM a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on IBM stock based on six Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm/forecast\">average IBM price target</a>&nbsp;of $294.75 per share implies 3.8% downside risk.</p>",

That might not have been Zaslav in particular saying that, but Zaslav did say that the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/unexpected-change-of-plans-warner-bros-discovery-nasdaqwbd-may-keep-zaslav\">board of directors</a> would be demanding a higher price to sell out.</p>\n<p>After all, Zaslav pointed out, Warner already rejected three different bids from Paramount Skydance. It is clearly not afraid to say no. And even if Warner does not hear a bid sufficient to make itself sell out, Warner still has a plan going forward with the splitting off into Warner Bros and Discovery Global, still on tap to happen next year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Growing Concern</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, there is a growing concern within Warner that they might actually get that offer in question. The one that actually makes the board ready to sit up and sign papers. New reports from insiders are an odd mix of terror and bemusement as the rank-and-file is basically waiting for the axe to drop.</p>\n<p>While \"business-as-usual\" memos fly around, employees are reportedly discussing who will actually beat the hangman and come out on the other side of any deal. But overall, Warner staff right now remembers that it has been through these kinds of things before, and likely will see them again. One report noted, \"The company has been flipped and flopped so many times that everyone is just like, 'We'll see what happens.' Everyone just has their head down.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is WBD Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on eight Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>For context, Hims &amp; Hers Health provides accessible healthcare products and services, including prescription medications and wellness products. The company's new GLP-1 push could spark fresh investor interest <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hims/earnings\">ahead of its Q3 results</a>. Hims has rapidly gained market share, operating in a legal gray zone with its compounded weight-loss drugs. However, with regulatory changes and rising competition, it remains to be seen whether this momentum can translate into a meaningful boost for HIMS stock.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hims Launches GLP-1 Microdosing Treatment Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, Hims announced it will start offering GLP-1 \"microdosing treatments.\" Notably, microdosing GLP-1s means using smaller-than-usual doses, often to cut costs or minimize side effects. However, Hims promotes it as a way to support overall \"metabolic health.\"</p>\n<p>The company further stated that while GLP-1 microdosing is still a new approach that needs more research, early studies indicate these treatments could offer benefits beyond just weight management. These treatments will be offered not only to patients with a high BMI but also to those with other metabolic health risks, such as sleep apnea or high blood pressure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/hims-stock-hims-rises-as-fda-publishes-green-list-novo-nordisk-shares-slip\">Hims currently sells compounded semaglutide</a>, which is the same active ingredient found in Wegovy, at doses comparable to Novo's versions. Now, the company says its healthcare providers will also offer GLP-1 microdosing plans, which use different, likely lower doses than those made by Novo. The new microdosing plan will be priced the same as its other compounded GLP-1 offerings, at $1,200 for a six-month package paid upfront.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Analysts Expect from HIMS' Q3 Earnings</strong></h2>\n<p>The company is set to report its Q3 2025 results on November 3, with investors looking for signs of renewed revenue momentum after growth slowed in the previous quarter.

Now, Ford is looking to get that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/this-time-its-windshield-related-ford-stock-nysef-slips-with-latest-multi-recall-burst\">factory back online</a>, and will put the roughly $370 million in question to work in aid of that. Located in Tamil Nadu, the Maraimalai Nagar site is looking to put out over 200,000 engines per year. Interestingly, the engines are not meant to come back to the United States, but it is unclear just where the engines will go.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Ford had an opportunity to set up a different deal back in 2020, when Jim Farley first became CEO of Ford. It was set to make a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd., which in turn would have kept Ford vehicles in play in India. But since India was then considered a \"marginal\" market, like Brazil, Ford decided to pull back and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/moonroof-defect-ford-stock-nysef-slips-on-new-power-company-plan\">keep its capital</a> instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>China Can \"Put Us All Out of Business\"</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jim Farley is also deeply concerned about the state of the global market, believing the very real possibility that China could put every American automaker out of business. Farley noted that China currently has enough production capacity to cover the entire North American market, which would render Ford and its contemporaries largely extraneous in their own backyard.</p>\n<p>Farley compared this development to the Japanese car market of the 1980s, which was significant, but even back then, much smaller. China's industrial potential is staggering, and this poses what Farley called \"…a completely different level of risk for our industry.\" This in turn prompted several changes at Ford, though it remains to be seen if these will be sufficient.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, nine Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
