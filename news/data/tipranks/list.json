This also marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase. On a year-over-year basis, PPI climbed 2.9%, topping expectations of 2.6%. The index is closely watched by investors because several of its components flow into the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/pce-price-index-yoy-60\">Personal Consumption Expenditures</a> (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/core-ppi-yoy-144\">Core PPI</a>, which excludes food and energy items, grew 0.8% in January and increased 3.6% from the prior year, marking the fastest annual pace since March 2025. Both figures exceeded estimates of 0.3% and 3.0%, respectively.</p>\n<p>The rise in PPI was fueled by a 0.8% monthly increase in services prices, the largest since July 2025, while goods prices fell 0.3%. More than 20% of the services gain came from a 14.4% surge in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesalers.</p>\n<p>\"Retailers'&nbsp;<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a>&nbsp;bill has come down marginally in the last few months, but they have continued to lift their selling prices,\" wrote Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief U.S. Economist Samuel Tombs in a note to clients.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/tech\">tech sector continues to face weakness</a> as concerns about the impact of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spread across the industry.

With the deal drama removed, Netflix can return to its core growth formula, focus on pricing power, subscriber growth, and margin expansion, which Yoon says has fueled its long‑term success and should continue to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramount Skydance: </strong>Even if PSKY is paying a premium, Yoon argued that acquiring WBD is still a better strategic path than continuing a \"mediocre standalone trajectory.\" The deal gives PSKY a chance to reshape its future. Yoon does not expect the company to push the price much higher, but he sees strategic logic in the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Warner Bros.

The statement said Microsoft keeps its exclusive license to OpenAI technology and that core services and developer access to the models continue to run on Azure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft Still the Main Partner?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Amazon news drew attention because Microsoft has been OpenAI's main infrastructure and product partner.

The company is expected to reveal the product at its GTC developer conference next month.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Unlike Nvidia's traditional chips used to train large AI models, the new processor focuses on inference computing. This is the stage when an AI system answers questions, writes code, or carries out tasks after the model has already been built.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NVDA Moves Beyond Training Chips</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia's graphics processors have long dominated the training of large AI models. However, demand is now moving toward running those models in everyday applications. As businesses deploy AI tools for coding, search, and customer service, they need chips that can deliver quick answers while using less power.</p>\n<p>The planned processor is intended to handle those requests more efficiently. Reports indicate OpenAI could become one of the major customers, using the system to improve the speed of its tools.</p>\n<p>The company hinted at this earlier when it said it would purchase \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia as part of a broader agreement. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazons-50b-openai-bet-hinges-on-key-conditions-what-investors-should-know\">OpenAI also signed a separate deal to use Amazon</a> <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> Trainium chips, showing customers are exploring multiple suppliers for AI computing needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia's New Chip Comes amid Rising Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>The new processor also comes as competition in AI hardware rises. Several large tech companies are building alternatives so they do not depend as much on Nvidia's systems. Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-eyes-in-house-chips-to-cut-ai-costs-a-challenge-to-nvidia-nvda\">Amazon have launched their own AI chips</a>, while smaller startups are creating processors made mainly for inference tasks.</p>\n<p>Nvidia still holds a large share of the AI chip market, but the move toward real-time AI services is pushing the company to broaden its product lineup. By launching a chip built for inference, Nvidia is trying to keep its lead as AI shifts from building models to actually running them in apps and services.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Price Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy Consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">average Nvidia price target of $273.38</a>&nbsp;implies 54.29% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA shares have surged nearly 42%.</p>",
