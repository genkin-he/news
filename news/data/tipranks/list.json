            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>SanDisk <a data-ticker=\"SNDK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk\">(SNDK)</a> stock has been on a tear, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk\">up 1,258% in the past 12 months</a>. However, there are probably only about six to nine months of upside left, so I rate the stock a Hold right now. The company is a NAND flash memory and storage supplier that's critical in the datacenter boom. With consensus modeling earnings growth normalization in Fiscal 2028, and markets pricing about 12 months in advance, around mid-to-late 2026 appears the most likely window when SNDK stock will start to drop (the company's financial year ends in June).&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consensus Upside Points to Further Growth Ahead</strong></h2>\n<p>Consensus points to a sharp earnings ramp into June 2026, whereby EPS will rise by nearly 1,230% year-over-year, followed by a 103% gain in Fiscal 2027. Based on my analysis, this means that we have probably 50% upside left at most in SNDK before the rally begins to break. This is just an estimate, but the equity is one I prefer to avoid, given it's highly cyclical and we are late in the bull run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If SNDK stock delivers EPS of $80 in Fiscal 2027, aligning with consensus, and trades at a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/statistics\">forward P/E of just 12</a>, which is much lower than the present 16.75 but would reflect deteriorating sentiment as growth slows, the stock price would peak at $960 per share by the end of Fiscal 2026. This would be the bull case, and reflects ongoing confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps more likely is that the P/E compresses further. Fiscal 2027 EPS of $80 and a forward P/E in June 2026 of 9 would reflect a $720 per share stock price. The current stock price is $650, so the implied upside in the base and bull outcomes is 11% to 48%. Obviously, a higher rally could occur, but I am not a buyer at the current position and risk-reward dynamics and maintain a neutral rating.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NAND Flash Offers a Cyclical Boom and Bust</strong></h2>\n<p>The core driver of this <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-sandisk-stock-sndk-is-crushing-the-sp-500-in-2026\">strong and short growth is NAND cyclicality</a>. Peak margins in Fiscal 2026 to Fiscal 2027 show tight supply and strong pricing, conditions that historically incentivize incremental capacity. As supply is ramped up in response, pricing typically shifts from rising to flat and then lower, which compresses earnings eventually. Even modest average selling price normalization can lead to outsized earnings stagnation in NAND markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We should also remember that if hyperscale or enterprise demand is partially front-loaded into Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027, a digestion phase can reduce growth in Fiscal 2028. This is not entirely unlikely, especially with the potential for energy bottlenecks to cause such a slowdown in demand. Clearly, the two-pronged impact of lower demand and higher prepared supply would not be good for SNDK investors. This is a primary reason why I remain neutral on the stock.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Datacenter Buildout Has Been the Center of SanDisk's Rise</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/earnings\">SanDisk's recent Q2 operating results</a> show revenue up 31% sequentially, with GAAP gross margin expanding to 50.9% from 29.8% in the prior quarter. Datacenter revenue specifically was up 64% sequentially, underscoring strong hyperscale demand. In Q3, gross margin is expected to be 64.9% to 66.9%, indicating powerful near-term momentum. However, we must remember that this is largely already priced in.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/financials\">balance sheet also supports the valuation throughout this cycle</a>, as it has $1.539 billion in cash versus $603 million in total debt. Net cash is therefore about $0.94 billion while Q2 free cash flow was $980 million. However, the company does have a joint venture with Kioxia Flash Ventures, where SanDisk pays variable costs plus half fixed costs regardless of output, meaning utilization swings can pressure margins significantly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is SanDisk Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, SanDisk has a consensus Moderate Buy rating, based on 11 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sells. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/forecast?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">average SNDK price target</a> of $637.33 indicates a -0.19% downside potential over the next 12 months. The high target is $1,000 per share, but the low target is $235. This indicates a risky stock that is likely only worthwhile as a small, targeted allocation for the bulls out there.&nbsp;</p>",

As CEO, Aravind Srinivas wrote, \"One reason, another codes, another writes.\" He also said, \"Perplexity Computer orchestrates 19 models.\" In short, the product works like a manager that gives each AI model a task it does best.</p>\n<p>In addition, the system links to a file base, browser, and other tools. That means it can research, design, code, and deploy a project in one flow. The firm says the goal is to let AI run tasks in the cloud even while the user is offline. Srinivas framed it this way: \"AI essentially becomes the Computer.\"</p>\n<p>As a result, Perplexity is moving past search and into task control. Rather than just answer a prompt, the system aims to manage a full job. That could make it more useful for founders, coders, and firms that want AI to save time and cut costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing, Rivals, and Market Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>For now, Perplexity Computer is tied to the Max plan at $200 per month, plus usage fees. Srinivas said this is \"the right business model for AI instead of ads.\" That comment may hint at a push to avoid the ad model used by Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, and is destined for OpenAI users. Instead, Perplexity is leaning on direct user pay, much like other AI tools that target pro users.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the launch adds more pressure to the race among AI firms. Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> backs <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\">OpenAI</a> and has built AI tools into its cloud and Office suite. Alphabet is pushing Gemini across its search and Android base. Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-delivers-another-ai-fueled-beat-so-why-was-the-stock-reaction-so-modest\">powers much of the chip side of the AI boom</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> and other model labs are also building tools that can plan and run tasks.</p>\n<p>Perplexity's approach stands out because it does not rely on one model. Instead, it pulls in models from several labs and assigns each one a role. That could help it adjust cost and speed based on the task. However, it also means Perplexity depends on access to outside models.</p>\n<p>In parallel, the firm is set to gain more reach. Samsung <a data-ticker=\"SSNLF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">(SSNLF)</a> is expected to add the Perplexity assistant to its Galaxy S26 line, with the wake phrase \"Hey Plex.\" If that move takes hold in the U.S. and abroad, it could give Perplexity a wider base of users.</p>\n<p>Overall, Perplexity Computer shows how AI firms are trying to move from chat to action. Rather than just provide answers, they want AI to run projects and manage tools.</p>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=GOOGL&amp;ticker=META&amp;ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=BABA&amp;ticker=TCEHY&amp;ticker=GOOG\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare notable publicly traded companies that employ chatbots similar to ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude. It's an excellent tool to gain a broader perspective on each stock and the AI industry as a whole.</p>",
