Even so, CoreWeave seems to be positioned on the right side of the trade as investor appetite continues to lean toward companies that own and operate AI-focused data centers, and that is where CoreWeave's value proposition lies.

Revenue is anticipated to increase by 101% to $1.5 billion.</p>\n<p>However, Evercore's Amit Daryanani, an analyst ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, believes the company can beat that figure given what he views as a \"de-risked setup.\" Recall that in the prior quarter management reduced its CY25 revenue guide to account for temporary delays in delivering powered-shell data center capacity in Q4.</p>\n<p>He also sees potential to outperform the Street's $138 million EBIT forecast, though EPS may be harder to model accurately as CRWV continues investing to scale operations.</p>\n<p>For the December quarter, Daryanani thinks investor attention will center on the schedule for powered-shell data center deliveries, progress in locking in incremental long-term capacity and the funding environment – with the broadened NVIDIA partnership viewed as a supportive factor – as well as the read-through for CY26 revenue.</p>\n<p>Recent reporting referencing internal memos about a \"chip delivery milestone\" at a facility in Denton, Texas, indicated that more than 16,000 GPUs were operational by late December and that total data center capacity could approach roughly 850 MW by year-end. Against that backdrop, the analyst thinks the Q1 Street revenue forecast of about $2.3 billion appears attainable. Daryanani sees the Q4 backlog landing in the mid-to-high $50 billion range, largely unchanged from Q3, as the company prioritizes securing additional data center capacity, with revenue primarily constrained by supply rather than demand.</p>\n<p>Additional topics investors will be monitoring include the transition from Blackwell to Rubin and how the ramp timing could affect revenue; availability of powered-shell data center capacity, including updates on self-built facilities; and the strategy to generate revenue from software offerings such as SUNK and Mission Control by selling them to other cloud providers. Overall, while strong demand and the debate over GPU useful life – with several data points suggesting GPUs can remain productive for more than 10 years – are well understood, the 5-star analyst thinks attention has increasingly shifted toward CRWV's ability to secure the capacity required to sustain future expansion.</p>\n<p>All told, Daryanani maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $160 price target that points toward 12-month returns of 65%. (To watch Daryanani's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/amit-daryanani\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The rest of the Street's ratings splits into an even 8 Buys and Holds, each, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $118.57, the average target implies shares will gain 22% over the one-year timeframe. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">See CRWV stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Despite recent rumors, PayPal <a data-ticker=\"PYPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl\">(PYPL)</a> is not actively seeking a buyer and is not in <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-paypal-stock-pypl-soars-as-stripe-considers-a-potential-acquisition\">negotiations with Stripe</a> or any other company. Instead, insiders say that the fintech firm has been quietly preparing for months to defend itself against potential activist investors or hostile takeover attempts, according to <em>Semafor</em>. This precautionary move came after a sharp drop in PayPal's stock price raised concerns that the company could become vulnerable. Although <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that Stripe has explored acquiring PayPal, the company has declined to comment on the speculation.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>However, even if Stripe wanted to proceed, pulling off such a deal would be extremely challenging. Because Stripe is privately owned, it cannot use publicly traded shares as currency in a merger, which is how many large acquisitions are financed. Instead, it would need an enormous amount of debt financing to fund a cash purchase, especially if PayPal resisted. Deals of this scale between private buyers and public targets are rare and often require complex financial engineering. </p>\n<p>Still, the strategic logic behind the interest is easy to understand. PayPal controls a large network of users and payment infrastructure that is deeply embedded in global commerce, making it a highly attractive asset for any major fintech player. However, any meaningful discussions would likely have to wait until PayPal's leadership transition settles and the company clarifies its long-term strategy. For now, the firm appears focused on protecting its independence rather than entertaining offers, which caused its stock to drop in today's trading.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PYPL Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on PYPL stock based on five Buys, 26 Holds, and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl/forecast\">average PYPL price target</a> of $51.35 per share implies 13.5% upside potential.</p>",

In a bizarre kind of way, that kind of outstanding performance has become par for the course for the chip giant, and investors' reaction to the print has been a negative one, with shares down 5% in Thursday's trading as of writing. Right now, the market seems reluctant to reward anything <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-related, no matter the strength on display.</p>\n<p>The Street's biggest NVDA bull, however, has no such issues. \"We view the risk/reward positive post a beat/raise quarter,\" said Evercore's Mark Lipacis, an analyst ranked among the top 1% on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Lipacis thinks the stock will outperform eventually as investors gain clarity on two key concerns. The first is whether CapEx growth can continue beyond 2027. In short, Lipacis thinks it can. While many liken today's AI spending to the Internet bubble of 2000, Lipacis points out two crucial distinctions: first, the Internet was a medium \"looking for an app,\" whereas AI is the application in search of compute cycles; second, internet infrastructure spending happened before returns were realized, while AI investment is being funded by actual returns. For instance, AI spending has driven a 35%-90% rise in revenue per employee over the past three years at hyperscalers, reducing costs in both software and headcount. The analyst believes AI-driven savings on $60 trillion in global OpEx are already financing current AI investments. In other words, AI CapEx isn't entirely new spending – it's largely a reallocation, shifting money from enterprise OpEx to the CapEx of hyperscalers, neoclouds, model developers, and enterprises. With current hyperscale CapEx at $1 trillion, less than 2% of global OpEx, Lipacis thinks there is \"more to go.\"</p>\n<p>The second concern is whether demand for AI tokens can sustain its \"parabolic growth.\" Here, too, Lipacis believes it can. Agentic AI represents a \"change in the paradigm\" for compute demand. In prior computing eras, such as PCs or smartphones, demand was constrained by the number of people – 8 billion people can only purchase so many devices. With Agentic AI, multiple autonomous agents can operate simultaneously on behalf of individuals or businesses, interacting with other agents in parallel. This creates virtually unlimited demand for AI tokens. \"Agentic AI has only just started, we expect parabolic growth demand for tokens will continue,\" the 5-star analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Lipacis maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, alongside his Street-high price target of $352, implying the stock will gain 90% in the year ahead. (To watch Lipacis' track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-lipacis\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NVDA stock's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 36 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. At $272.65, the average target offers 12-month upside of 47%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Mastercard <a data-ticker=\"MA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">(MA)</a> and MetaMask announced the official U.S. launch of their joint crypto debit card. This rollout is a massive win for the industry because it includes New York, a state known for having the toughest crypto rules in the country. Now, almost any American can use their digital assets to pay for groceries, gas, or even a Netflix subscription. The news sent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">Mastercard's stock up by 1.2% in early trading on Thursday</a>.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mastercard Integration Provides Global Reach</strong></h2>\n<p>The secret to this card's success is the massive network provided by Mastercard. Instead of trying to build a new payment system from scratch, MetaMask is plugging directly into Mastercard's existing ecosystem. This means you can use the card at over 150 million stores and websites worldwide.</p>\n<p>Partnering with a giant like Mastercard gives crypto the stamp of approval it needs for everyday use. When you tap your phone to pay, the Mastercard network handles the heavy lifting, turning your crypto into dollars in the blink of an eye. This integration allows users to keep their money in the digital world while still being able to spend it in the physical one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-Custody Tech Keeps You in Control</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike traditional crypto cards, which act like a bank account where the company holds your money, the MetaMask Card is different. It uses self-custody technology, which means the tokens stay in your private wallet until the exact second you make a purchase. You are the only person with the keys to your funds.</p>\n<p>Retaining full control of your assets is a huge selling point for people who don't trust big exchanges. Most other cards require you to pre-load money onto an exchange, which can be slow and risky. With this new setup, the money only leaves your wallet when you say so. This creates a much safer and faster experience for everyone involved.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoin Support Reduces Market Risk</strong></h2>\n<p>To make spending more predictable, the card focuses on stablecoins like <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/usdc/forecast\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/usdt-usd\">USDT</a>. Because these tokens are pegged to the U.S. dollar, you don't have to worry about the price of your coffee money crashing while you are standing in line. The card also supports <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">ETH-USD</a></strong>) for those who want to spend their gains directly.</p>\n<p>Focusing on stablecoins <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-stock-reloads-its-crypto-gun-as-zuckerberg-eyes-stablecoin-dominance\">is a smart move for mainstream adoption</a>. It makes crypto feel more like a regular checking account and less like a gamble. As more people move their paychecks into stablecoins to earn higher interest, having a Mastercard that can spend those funds instantly makes the bankless lifestyle a very real option for millions of Americans.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Mastercard Still a Good Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buy and three Hold ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma/forecast\">average 12-month MA price target</a> of $660&nbsp;implies 28.3% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">MA shares have fallen 9.24%</a>.</p>",
