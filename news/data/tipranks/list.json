Of course, our bar for any M&amp;A is high, but we continue to look at opportunities.\"</p>\n<p>However, he told <em>The Times </em>newspaper that he was skeptical about large-scale M&amp;A, likely in reference to BP. There have been consistent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-british-petroleum-bp-in-talks-to-be-acquired-by-shell\">rumors that BP is a takeover target </a>given its struggling share price in recent times.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strong Earnings</strong></h2>\n<p>It came as Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.43 billion for the third quarter of 2025, surpassing analyst guidance.</p>\n<p>It said this represented a 27% increase on the previous quarter but was lower than the $6 billion reported over the same period a year earlier. Shell's total production was equivalent to 2.8 million barrels of oil per day in the third quarter, broadly flat on a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Volumes improved against the previous quarter, while the business also flagged a $161 million benefit from favorable tax write-offs over the quarter.</p>\n<p>Shell is also a consistent dividend payer – see below – and is known for its share buybacks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Amazon recently fired up some layoffs in Amazon Games, as well as across its overall operation. But that ultimately meant an end to updates in <em>New World: Aeturnum</em>, a game that is actually <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-is-about-to-report-q3-earnings-heres-what-to-expect\">still quite popular.</a> In fact, <em>New World</em> recently released its Season 10 updates, along with the <em>Nighthaven</em> update, which will apparently prove to be the last.</p>\n<p>Amazon Games, via representatives, noted, \"After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.\" But those who still want to play the game can, and PlayStation Plus subscribers can also keep the game going on Extra and Premium tiers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>That Was Not All</strong></h2>\n<p>And as Amazon moved to shut down a game in progress, it also moved to potentially shutter a game that did not even exist yet. Reports suggest that the MMORPG based around <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has been canceled, though other reports suggest that there may yet be some room for it to come out later.</p>\n<p>Amazon got into games in the first place because it saw an opportunity, but perhaps went after the wrong kind of games. Reports suggest that Amazon still plans to pursue \"…casual and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-experiences-azure-and-365-outages-hours-before-earnings-release\">AI-focused</a> games\" such as <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em>, a game that features Snoop as a judge between players staging courtroom-style debates.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon a Good Long-Term Investment?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 41 Buys assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 23.55% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">average AMZN price target</a> of $269.24 per share implies 19.24% upside potential.</p>",
