            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reddit Rises Above Wall Street</strong></h2>\n<p>RDDT stock <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\">backpedaled from a nearly 8% drop</a> from the previous day, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\">rising more than 11%</a> to $216.20 per share on Friday as of 6:37 a.m., as investors began to digest the latest financial results. </p>\n<p>In its third-quarter results, the California-based company <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt/earnings\">saw sales jump 68%</a> from the same period last year, hitting $585 million and surpassing analysts' forecast of $549.12 million. It also recorded total daily active uniques (DAUq) of 116 million, up 19% year-over-year. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wall Street Rains Praise on Reddit</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings, Wall Street analysts on Friday showered RDDT stock with price boosts and Buy ratings. According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-colantuoni\">Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni</a>, who maintained his $300 price target on Reddit — more than 50% upside — the \"commanding\" performance emphasizes the social media company's \"attractive opportunity\" to drive increased advertisers' spending. </p>\n<p>This comes from platform enhancement, the introduction of new products, and designs that make the platform easier to use. Colantuoni believes that while Reddit's growth matches its peers, this state is not yet reflected in its stock market value.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/andrew-boone\">Citizens analyst Andrew Boone</a>, who maintains the same price target as Colantouni, hailed Reddit's advertising strategy and further emphasized that the social news aggregator remains \"increasingly important\" to the open web ecosystem as search engines and chatbots rely on its content. </p>\n<p>Among other factors, Boone, who is a five-star analyst, sees the addition of Answers — an&nbsp;AI-powered feature that collates and summarizes responses to users' queries — as Reddit's default search function to be \"a significant\" catalyst for next year. Boone also pointed out that the introduction of machine translation across international markets is helping Reddit gain more users. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Google a Threat to Reddit?</strong></h2>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/brad-erickson\"></a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/firms/rbc-capital\">RBC Capital</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.streetinsider.com/entities/Mark+Zuckerberg\"></a>analyst Brad Erickson, who maintained his $245 price target with a Sector Perform (Hold) rating, pointed out that slowing growth in the number of daily active users might amplify the arguments of bearish analysts.</p>\n<p>Skeptics have raised concerns about Reddit's future in the face of Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> Google generative <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> solutions. As a case study, Erickson pointed to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-earnings-alphabet-jumps-after-smashing-q3-estimates\">the strong adoption of Google's new AI Mode</a>, reported in its Q3 results released on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the five-star analyst said his team is still awaiting clarity on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/reddit-rddt-seeks-new-ai-content-deal-with-google\">whether Reddit will renew its AI deal with Google</a> and resolve wider industry concerns related to this partnership.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Reddit a Strong Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>While analysts have started to reassess their ratings and price targets on<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\"> Reddit's stock</a>, they are still early into this process. However, based on 24 ratings over the past three months, Reddit's shares currently have a Moderate Buy consensus recommendation. This breaks down to 16 Buys and eight Holds issued by analysts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt/forecast\">average RDDT price target</a> of $237.87 indicates more than 22% upside potential from the current level.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Indicators Hint at a Rebound</strong></h2>\n<p>On the 4-hour chart, XRP bounced off support at $2.39 and is testing resistance near $2.53. Both the Money Flow Index (MFI) and the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd/technical-analysis\">Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest</a> selling pressure is easing. The MFI sits near 30, a zone that often precedes fresh accumulation, while the RSI, now rising from 41, signals that bearish momentum is losing strength.</p>\n<p>This shift in tone could mark the early stages of a trend reversal. If buying volume holds, traders see a path toward the upper end of the current range, with $2.72 acting as the next key resistance level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>ETF Approval Hopes Boost Sentiment</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism is also being driven by the CanaryFunds XRP spot ETF, now expected to debut on Nov. 13. The recent removal of the SEC's delay amendment has lifted sentiment across the market and sparked renewed institutional interest.</p>\n<p>As <em><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">Crypto</a> In America</em> journalist Eleanor Terrett reported, \"CanaryFunds has filed an updated S-1 for its XRP spot ETF, removing the 'delaying amendment' that stops a registration from going auto-effective and gives the SEC control over timing.\"</p>\n<p>This procedural change clears the way for the ETF to move forward without further SEC holdups. If the fund launches as planned, it could channel new capital into the market right as XRP shows early signs of technical recovery, which is a mix that traders say could finally help the token retest the $3 mark.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Momentum Builds across Timeframes</strong></h2>\n<p>On the daily chart, the MACD has turned bullish, with the 12-day EMA crossing above the 20-day EMA and histogram bars turning green. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is also trending upward, pointing to strengthening inflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">At $2.50, XRP sits near a key Fibonacci level</a>. A confirmed breakout above $2.72 could open a path toward $3.26, while failure to hold above $2.22 would risk another pullback. At the current moment, imomentum appears to be shifting in the bulls' favor and after months of sideways trading, XRP may finally be ready to move again.</p>",

Impressed by the performance, the 5-star analyst called Q3 the \"AWS Unlock Quarter,\" adding that \"now the Amplification Catalysts can take over.\" Mahaney noted the Q3 beat and that Q4 revenue and operating income guidance bracketed the Street's estimates. He highlighted that fundamental trends were generally positive in Q3, with top-line growth consistent with the second quarter and operating margin at record highs.</p>\n<p>Among the key takeaways, Mahaney noted the 20% year-over-year AWS growth was the fastest in 11 quarters, with the quarter-over-quarter growth in dollars handily outpacing Azure for the first time since the third quarter of 2022. He also pointed out that the backlog reached $200 billion and that October deal volume was greater than all of Q3. Furthermore, Trainium2 revenue surged 150% quarter over quarter. \"The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> narrative has flipped positive for AWS,\" said Mahaney.</p>\n<p>Mahaney also mentioned the robust performance of Amazon's retail business, citing \"very consistent\" double-digit revenue growth in North America and International segments. Interestingly, Amazon stated that its shopping chatbot Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Finally, Mahaney highlighted the rapid growth in Amazon's advertising revenue.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Canaccord Analyst Sees More Upside in AMZN Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>Canaccord Genuity&nbsp;analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/maria-ripps\">Maria Ripps</a> increased the price target for Amazon stock to $300 from $280 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. The 5-star analyst stated that in what was a pivotal quarter for AWS amid rising investor concerns about its business lagging in AI-centric workloads, the cloud unit saw its growth accelerate about 270 basis points quarter-over-quarter to over 20%, representing the segment's largest growth rate in 11 quarters. Ripps noted the robust backlog at the end of Q3 and the addition of more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, with another gigawatt anticipated to come online in Q4, and management expecting to double power capacity by 2027.</p>\n<p>Ripps highlighted the surge in Trainum2 revenue and stated that it is now a \"fully subscribed, multibillion-dollar business.\" Further, Trainum3, which is expected to be 40% more cost-efficient, is on track to be previewed at the end of the year, with management expecting it to drive demand from medium-sized businesses.</p>\n<p>The top-rated analyst also noted the strength in online stores, with momentum in Everyday Essentials, and sequential acceleration in advertising revenue growth by 60 basis points amid momentum with Prime Video and Amazon DSP. Given greater visibility into further AWS acceleration in Q4 and 2026, Ripps expects AMZN stock to gain momentum as investor confidence rebuilds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>With 41 unanimous Buys, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock. The average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">AMZN stock price target</a> of $269.24 indicates 21% upside potential.</p>",

The firm said that while investors may watch consumer spending closely, Amazon's core e-commerce, cloud, and ad businesses remain strong.</p>\n<p>The firm highlighted that AWS should gain from rising demand for AI tools among large companies, while Amazon's retail and delivery network keeps getting more efficient and lowering costs. He added that Amazon's advertising unit is growing quickly with high profit margins, becoming a bigger source of earnings.</p>\n<p>Goldman expects Amazon to keep improving both sales and margins in the coming years, supported by its mix of strong businesses and steady investment in new technology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sees Multi-Year Growth Cycle Ahead for Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman raised the price target on Apple to $320 from $279 and kept a Buy rating.

He also pointed to Apple's plans for new designs, such as a potential foldable iPhone in 2026, and ongoing investment across its product line.</p>\n<p>On the services side, revenue rose 15% year over year, lifted by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.

Earlier this month, the startup announced a partnership with CoreWeave <a data-ticker=\"CRWV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv\">(CRWV)</a> to build <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-teams-up-with-nvidia-backed-poolside-to-build-massive-data-center\">one of the largest data centers in the U.S.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-nvda-rockets-to-historic-5-trillion-valuation-on-gtc-strength\">Nvidia briefly crossed the $5 trillion market valuation</a> mark, driven by new partnership announcements at its annual GTC Conference in Washington, D.C. However, on Thursday, NVDA shares fell more than 2% after the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/us-president-trump-china-president-xi-meeting-10232\">Trump–Xi summit</a> failed to deliver any updates on chip sales, dampening investor sentiment. Year-to-date, Nvidia stock remains up over 50%.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">NVDA stock</a>&nbsp;has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on&nbsp;36 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months.

MSFT expects the growth rate in Fiscal 2026 capex to exceed that in FY25.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>JPMorgan Expects Chip Stocks to Benefit from High AI Spending</strong></h2>\n<p>JPMorgan noted that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have each raised their 2025 capital expenditure budgets and indicated further increases in 2026. These tech giants have reinforced expectations for continued growth in AI-related investments in compute, networking, and storage. JPMorgan stated that the spending updates by tech giants \"corroborate\" its view that cloud and hyperscale data center spending will remain \"structurally elevated\" over the longer term as demand for AI computing continues to rise.</p>\n<p>In particular, analysts at JPMorgan see Nvidia, Broadcom <a data-ticker=\"AVGO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/avgo\">(AVGO)</a>, Marvell Technology <a data-ticker=\"MRVL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mrvl\">(MRVL)</a>, and Advanced Micro Devices <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a> as key beneficiaries from rising demand for AI servers and chips. They also expect memory makers Micron <a data-ticker=\"MU\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mu\">(MU)</a> and Western Digital <a data-ticker=\"WDC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wdc\">(WDC)</a>, as well as networking firms Allegro MicroSystems <a data-ticker=\"ALGM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/algm\">(ALGM)</a> and MACOM Technology <a data-ticker=\"MTSI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mtsi\">(MTSI)</a>, to gain from continued spending on AI infrastructure. Specifically, JPMorgan expects Nvidia to benefit from accelerating GPU (graphics processing unit) demand, while Broadcom and Marvell are well-positioned to address the demand for their custom AI processors developed with Google, Meta Platforms, and Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, JPMorgan expects AI-related capital expenditures to continue rising through 2027 as major tech companies compete to develop new models and deploy AI tools across their core businesses.</p>\n<p>Other Wall Street brokerages are also upbeat about continued AI spending. For instance, according to <em>CNBC</em>, Citi stated, \"AI party continues – good for&nbsp;AMD,&nbsp;AVGO,&nbsp;MU, and&nbsp;NVDA.\" Analysts at the bank added that the higher capex outlook from Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms supports their view that AI spending remains strong, positively impacting AI-exposed stocks such as AMD (19% of sales), Broadcom (33% of sales), Micron (18% of sales), and Nvidia (88% of sales).</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wall Street's Ratings for AI Chip Stocks</strong></h2>\n<p>Let's look at Wall Street's ratings for some of the chip stocks that are expected to gain from elevated AI spending.</p>\n<p>Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia, Broadcom, Micron, and Western Digital.
