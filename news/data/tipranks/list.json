Rosenblatt analyst John McPeake seems to think so. \"Yes, Palantir Really Is an 'N of 1'… With a \"rule of 40\" (4Q revenue growth of 70% plus adjusted operating margin of 57%) of 127% and 720bp of rev growth acceleration in 4Q, Palantir is indeed the 'N of 1' that CEO Alex Karp claims,\" the analyst said. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Palantir blends its proprietary infrastructure software with \"best-in-class technology practitioners\" to deliver fast, high-value solutions for enterprises and governments worldwide. McPeake says he has seen the company grow from a loss-making, services-focused startup in the early 2000s into a software leader with repeatable solutions, now generating 84% gross margins and 51% operating margins. \"In enterprise software, we think Palantir will add more free cash flow dollars in 2026 than any software company except for SAP,\" McPeake further added. \"We think Palantir is currently the only stack-agnostic company in technology that can provide an integrated enterprise platform for the rapid deployment of AI.\"</p>\n<p>Palantir's momentum has been driven by close partnerships with governments and defense agencies, along with fast, high-value deployments at major global enterprises, including the U.S. DoD, the CIA, BP, Merck, and General Mills. McPeake's conversations with several customers suggest there is still significant expansion potential within their existing base. The company's \"biggest moat\" lies in the synergy between its \"polymathic engineering team\" and its extensive, mission-critical, battle-tested infrastructure and integration software. With strong demand from both traditional IT modernization and emerging enterprise AI projects, McPeake sees Palantir as well-positioned to achieve double-digit top- and bottom-line growth over the next decade.</p>\n<p>Famously, Palantir's valuation is often mentioned as a turn-off for some. Indeed, a review of the biggest wealth-generating technology companies since 1981 shows that, even with its trailing twelve-month price-to-sales ratio dropping from a peak of 153x to 75x, Palantir remains an outlier.</p>\n<p>But McPeake thinks the valuation is justified. \"If one looks at the companies that have created the most value in technology when they were a similar size to Palantir, none of them was able to grow as fast as Palantir is forecasted to grow in year 8 (equivalent to Palantir's guidance in 2026),\" the analyst explained. Moreover, at least two of those companies – Facebook and Google – relied on major transformative acquisitions midway through that period, while Palantir's growth has been entirely organic.</p>\n<p>Given the stock has declined by 34.4% from last year's highs, McPeake thinks the shares now offer an \"attractive entry point.\" As such, McPeake initiated coverage of PLTR stock with a Buy rating, backed by a $150 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing returns of 10% a year from now. (To watch McPeake's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-mcpeake\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Street's average target is actually a more exuberant $188.82, a figure that points toward 12-month gains of 39%. On the rating front, based on a mix of 14 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

In a letter to shareholders, Dorsey said that over 4,000 employees are being asked to leave or enter into consultation. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said these layoffs will position the company for the next phase of its long-term growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bank of America Analyst Raises Price Target</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jason-kupferberg\">Jason Kupferberg</a> raised his price target for Block stock to $86 from $75 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted that the company expects to deliver 18% gross profit growth in 2026, while slashing headcount by 40%, powered by AI. He added that Block's margin expansion is \"dramatic,\" with adjusted operating income margin expected to increase to 26% in 2026 from 20% last year.</p>\n<p>Management attributed this margin improvement to the company's \"evolution\" as the business improves, rather than to cost-cutting in response to weakness. Kupferberg noted that the company's Q4 results reinforce this narrative, with Cash App's gross profit rising 33% and the lending business expanding rapidly.</p>\n<p>Kupferberg thinks that the \"key debate is whether a smaller, AI‑powered workforce will succeed\". He added that as of now, investors are optimistic, as reflected in the surge in XYZ stock on the news. The analyst thinks that investors are applauding Block's proactive AI stance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Block a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Block stock based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xyz/forecast\">XYZ stock price target</a> of $86.08 indicates 58% upside potential.</p>",
