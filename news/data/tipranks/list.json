Additionally, the drug treated more than 40% of patients' total tumor burden. Adding to that, 20% of patients in the less-than-40% group saw their tumors shrink. There were also no dose-limiting toxicities among 64 monotherapy patients, and only seven patients experienced a grade 3 adverse event.</p>\n<p>Intensity Therapeutics founder, President, and CEO Lewis Bender stated, \"Given the drug's mechanism of action and the data reported in this paper from over 20 types of metastatic solid cancers, such as breast, sarcoma, pancreatic, lung, and head and neck, we believe the study results show the potential of INT230-6 to achieve clinical benefit for metastatic patients of multiple cancer types with or without the use of radiation, systemic drugs or immunotherapy. As a result, we have initiated randomized controlled studies, including a Phase 3 study in sarcoma.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Intensity Therapeutics Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ints\">Intensity Therapeutics stock was up 193.74% in pre-market trading on Thursday</a>, following a 5.95% rally yesterday.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Big Tech moves are also leaning on sentiment. Meta <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> and Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> traded lower premarket after earnings, while Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> jumped. When the group wobbles, Tesla often trades with the pack because many investors view it as an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> beneficiary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pay-Plan Politics Adds Uncertainty</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Calpers will vote against Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation plan. This opposition adds drama ahead of the Nov. 6 shareholder meeting.</p>\n<p>Most analysts still expect the package to pass, but any doubt around leadership incentives can cloud the near-term outlook. If the plan failed, it would introduce a new question mark for holders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Recall Headlines Create Noise, Not Damage</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors should not pin today's stock price drop just on recalls. Tesla is recalling 6,197 model-year 2024 Cybertrucks to fix a light bar, according to the NHTSA. This is a minor, low-cost issue in the context of auto recalls.</p>\n<p>Year to date, Tesla has recalled roughly 750,000 vehicles, while the top dozen automakers have recalled about 26 million. Recalls are part of doing business and rarely move auto stocks unless safety risks or repair costs are severe.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Longer-Term Picture Is Still in Play for Tesla</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the dip, Tesla remains up about 14% in 2025 and roughly 79% over the past 12 months. The bull narrative continues to lean on software, autonomy, and robotics as future profit drivers.</p>\n<p>Near term, the stock will trade on market tone, the Nov. 6 vote, and how investors handicap AI optionality versus a premium valuation. Today's slide looks more like a risk-off day and governance headline than a recall problem.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">TSLA stock</a>&nbsp;has received a Hold consensus rating, with 14 Buys, 11 Holds, and 10 Sells assigned in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">average 12-month&nbsp;stock price target for Tesla</a>&nbsp;is $382.54, suggesting a potential downside of 17.1% from the current level.</p>",

            "title": "'Too Inexpensive to Ignore,' Says C.J. Muse About Nvidia Stock",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>That came off the back of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at GTC. The event featured a series of announcements, including new collaborations for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> infrastructure with CoreWeave, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, xAI, and others; partnerships in Physical AI with Siemens, Caterpillar, and Toyota; a joint effort with the DOE to construct seven new supercomputers; a collaboration with Nokia to push forward AI-driven telecommunications and 6G innovations; initiatives to expand robotaxi operations, with DRIVE AGX Hyperion standing out; an operational AI partnership with Palantir; and the launch of the NVQLink architecture for integrating GPUs and QPUs.</p>\n<p>Taking it all in, Cantor's C.J. Muse, an analyst ranked among the top 1% of Street stock experts, says that such was the volume of announcements, listing them all would probably exceed his word limit. In any case, to Muse, what is becoming \"abundantly clear is NVDA's ability to leverage its CUDA-X libraries (the crown jewels) to open new markets and enable AI's proliferation.\"</p>\n<p>For instance, Muse points out Nvidia is developing a new communications platform in collaboration with Nokia, leveraging its full-stack solution and Aerial library to introduce a new product line, the Aerial RAN Computer (ARC), aimed at positioning the U.S. at the forefront of the 6G revolution. NVIDIA is also rolling out NVQLink with the CUDA-Q library to accelerate advancements in quantum computing, allowing GPUs to be a \"key beneficiary.\" Additionally, Muse highlights the DRIVE Hyperion architecture, which will create ready-to-deploy robotaxis. </p>\n<p>\"Overall,\" the 5-star analyst went on to say, \"these are just a few of the exciting announcements highlighting the breadth of NVDA's reach across virtually every market today.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Muse thinks current Street estimates are \"WAY too low.\" Huang noted that Nvidia now has over $500 billion in business booked for Blackwell/Rubin through 2026, including networking via NVLink, Spectrum, and InfiniBand – equivalent to 20 million GPUs, compared with Hopper's lifetime shipments of 4 million GPUs, of which 6 million have already been delivered. This suggests roughly $350–400 billion in data center business is already secured for the next five quarters, well above the consensus forecast of $318 billion over the same period. When accounting for business yet to be booked, Muse's previously highlighted EPS upside of $8+ for CY26 (vs. consensus at $6.31) now seems \"very conservative,\" likely tracking closer to $9–10, with prior data center revenue forecasts of around $300 billion now appearing on track toward $400 billion.</p>\n<p>And while some market watchers have begun warning about a looming AI bubble, Muse tackles that concern head-on, arguing that NVDA is still \"too inexpensive to ignore.\" At just 21x his updated CY26 EPS estimate of $9–10, the stock's valuation hardly screams excess. The picture becomes even more compelling when looking ahead to CY27; Muse had previously modeled $11 in EPS, but given current booking trends, even that now appears conservative. </p>\n<p>\"So we have zero concerns around any type of frothy valuation here, and with a clear path for numbers tracking meaningfully higher, NVDA remains our hands down Top Pick with plenty of room for continued upside,\" the analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Muse rates NVDA shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy), backed by a $300 price target. If that target is reached, investors would be looking at returns of ~45% over the next year. (To watch Muse's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/c-j-muse\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the Street, NVDA stock claims an additional 33 Buys, 2 Holds, and a single Sell, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year returns of ~12%, considering the average price target stands at $231.34.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The U.S. agreed to lower <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-trade-u-s-to-impose-100-additional-tariff-on-chinese-goods-thefly\">some tariffs on Chinese goods.</a> The change includes cutting the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on items linked to fentanyl production from 20% to 10%. In return, China will tighten its control over the export of the chemicals used to make the drug. Trump said China is now taking \"very strong action\" on the issue. The cut will also bring the average tariff on Chinese <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> down to 47% from 57%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trade, Agriculture, and Rare Earths</strong></h2>\n<p>The two sides also found a path <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/rare-earth-stocks-surge-as-trump-revives-u-s-mining-push\">on rare-earth exports</a>. These materials are key in products from <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/electric-vehicles\">electric vehicle</a> motors to medical gear. China plans to delay new export limits for one year, which should ease pressure on U.S. manufacturers. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said the \"roadblock\" to rare-earth imports is now gone. Still, analysts expect China to keep some control measures in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-says-china-not-buying-u-s-soybeans-economically-hostile-act-thefly\">China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans</a>. The country purchased several large shipments this week, each holding about two million bushels. That move offers relief to American farmers who have struggled during the harvest season. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said the new purchases are a \"great start\" for producers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Next Steps and Market Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>Trump said a broader trade deal could come \"pretty soon.\" He also noted that the United States will delay plans for new port fees on Chinese-owned or Chinese-built vessels. The change follows <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/150-billion-south-korean-push-aims-to-rebuild-u-s-shipyards\">South Korea's pledge to invest $150 billion in U.S. shipbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>Both leaders described the meeting as friendly. Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi is expected to visit the United States after that.</p>\n<p>For investors, the meeting may bring short-term optimism across global markets. Lower tariffs could benefit logistics and retail firms that rely on imports, while renewed Chinese purchases may lift agricultural stocks such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company <a data-ticker=\"ADM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/adm\">(ADM)</a> and Bunge Global SA <a data-ticker=\"BG\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bg\">(BG)</a>. Companies that use rare-earth materials, such as Tesla Inc. <a data-ticker=\"TSLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">(TSLA)</a>, &nbsp;USA Rare Earth&nbsp;<a data-ticker=\"USAR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/usar\">(USAR)</a>, and Lynas Rare Earths <strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:lyc\">(AU:LYC)</a></strong>, could also see some supply relief if export rules stay loose.</p>\n<p>Overall, the Busan meeting showed that both governments are seeking a calmer trade path after years of tension. Markets will now watch for follow-through on the promises made and any sign of a broader trade deal in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>By using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=TSLA&amp;ticker=BG&amp;ticker=ADM&amp;ticker=USAR&amp;ticker=AU%3ALYC&amp;ticker=MP&amp;ticker=LAC\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>, we've lined up all the companies mentioned in this piece to make it easy for investors to review each stock and see how they stack up across the agricultural and mineral sectors.</p>",
