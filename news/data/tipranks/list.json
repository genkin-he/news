            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The company plans to go public through a merger with Armada Acquisition Corp II, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) designed to help private firms list quickly. If approved by regulators and shareholders, the combined entity will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker XRPN in the first quarter of 2026.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Evernorth Builds a Public XRP Treasury</strong></h2>\n<p>Under the plan, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-price-finds-its-pulse-again-after-ripples-evernorth-loads-its-arsenal-with-1-billion-xrp\">Evernorth will raise more than $1 billion</a>, with most of the proceeds used for open-market XRP purchases and a smaller portion reserved for operations. SBI Holdings has committed $200 million as an anchor investor, joined by Ripple, Rippleworks, Pantera Capital, Kraken, GSR and others.</p>\n<p>At the helm is Asheesh Birla, a former Ripple executive who has stepped down from Ripple's board to become Evernorth's CEO. The move is designed to give the company independence while keeping alignment with Ripple's ecosystem. If the merger closes as expected, Evernorth would become the largest publicly traded holder of XRP, offering investors an equity-based route to the asset without handling wallets or compliance themselves.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Evernorth Creates an Alternative to an XRP ETF</strong></h2>\n<p>Evernorth <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/heres-why-the-xrp-etf-delivered-more-shrug-than-surge\">isn't launching an ETF</a>. Instead, it plans to operate as a public company that buys and manages XRP directly on its balance sheet. Investors can buy Evernorth shares, and the company will use that money to purchase XRP and manage it over time.</p>\n<p>The goal is to increase \"XRP per share\" through basic treasury strategies like lending, providing liquidity, and earning limited DeFi yield within clear risk controls. Because the stock trades like any other equity, investors get transparency, regular reporting, and no need to deal with <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> wallets or custody.</p>\n<p>For finance teams, it's a straightforward way to get XRP exposure through a regulated company rather than holding the token themselves.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Evernorth Details How the Treasury Will Operate</strong></h2>\n<p>If the SPAC deal closes, Evernorth will begin buying XRP in stages to minimize price impact. Its balance sheet will be subject to SEC reporting standards and quarterly disclosure cycles.</p>\n<p>The company also plans to participate as an XRP validator and use Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin as an on-ramp for XRP-denominated activity. Management says these steps could help integrate Evernorth's operations with Ripple's network while maintaining independent governance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can $1 Billion Can Move the XRP Market?</strong></h2>\n<p>A billion dollars is significant but not overwhelming for XRP's global trading volume. Ripple's most recent data shows about $3.2 billion in average daily volume across exchanges. Evernorth is expected to spread purchases over several months to reduce volatility.</p>\n<p>Still, a steady institutional buyer can tighten spreads and strengthen market depth. If XRPN stock trades at a premium, Evernorth could raise more capital and buy additional XRP, reinforcing the feedback loop between public equity demand and on-chain liquidity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Evernorth Prepares for Nasdaq Listing</strong></h2>\n<p>Evernorth's next step is regulatory approval. The company will file an SEC Form S-4 detailing the merger and governance plans, followed by a shareholder vote at Armada II. If cleared, it expects to list on Nasdaq under \"XRPN\" in early 2026.</p>\n<p>The final funding mix will decide how much cash goes toward XRP purchases. SBI has committed $200 million, with Ripple, Pantera, Kraken, and GSR expected to join. Once trading starts, investors will be watching Evernorth's first XRP purchases and quarterly updates to see if it can turn its billion-dollar vision into reality.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP is sitting at $2.55</a>.</p>",

            "title": "Insiders Are Snapping Up These 2 Stocks â€” and Analysts Like What They See",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>We don't mean anything nefarious by 'insiders'; they're corporate officers whose positions make them responsible for ensuring company profits and shareholder returns â€“ and also give them a deep view into the inner workings of their companies, along with early knowledge of just what effect those workings will have on share prices.</p>\n<p>All of that is just to say that insiders could have a better idea than the rest how their own firms' stocks are likely to move â€“ and they do trade shares on that knowledge. To keep the playing field level, regulatory authorities require that insiders publish their trading activities, and investors can follow those published trades, using them for market signals.</p>\n<p>We've used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-insider-trading-stocks\">Insiders' Hot Stocks</a> tool at TipRanks to look up the details on two stocks that the insiders love right now. These are stocks that are seeing recent multi-million-dollar insider buys â€“ and they have also attracted upbeat ratings from the Street's analysts. So, let's give these names a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>Summit Therapeutics</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smmt/forecast\"><strong>SMMT</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we'll look at is Summit Therapeutics, a biopharma company operating at the late clinical stage. Summit is studying the drug candidate ivonescimab as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of various types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The company is working with ivonescimab under a license agreement with the Chinese drug company Akeso; under the agreement, Summit has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan.</p>\n<p>The drug candidate, ivonescimab, is a new tetravalent molecule that brings together two oncological mechanisms that have already been validated. The drug is a first-in-class agent, described as an advanced PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody. It is designed to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment while avoiding healthy tissue. NSCLC, the disease target of Summit's current clinical trials, is the most common type of lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Currently, Summit is studying ivonescimab in the HARMONi, HARMONi-3, and HARMONi-7 trials. These trials are investigating the drug, respectively, as a second-line treatment for advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC; as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; and as a first-line treatment for metastatic PD-L1 high (â‰¥50%) NSCLC. We should also note that, on October 17, Summit announced that it is starting the HARMONi-GI3 study, the first global Phase 3 trial of ivonescimab to look beyond NSCLC. The new study, planned to start in the US before the end of this year, will focus on using ivonescimab to treat colorectal cancer, and total enrollment is planned for approximately 600 patients.</p>\n<p>Summit has recently reported positive results for ivonescimab from the HARMONi trial, and based on those results, the company has plans to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA during 4Q25. The company has also announced an update to the HARMONi-3 trial, under which it will release split analyses of ivonescimab, evaluating the drug plus chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC and in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Summit states that enrollment in the HARMONi-3 and -7 trials remains ongoing.</p>\n<p>Turning to the company's insiders, we find that several top-level corporate officers have made recent stock buys. Co-CEOs Maky Zanganeh and Robert Duggan each purchased 26,680 shares of the stock, paying approximately $500,000 each, while Board member Xia Yu spent nearly $10 million to pick up 533,617 shares. All three of these purchases were made on October 21 and totaled just under $11 million.</p>\n<p>For Citizens JMP analyst Reni Benjamin, there are two key points for investors to consider regarding Summit: the company's extensive late-stage clinical trials and its deep pockets. Benjamin writes, \"Ivonescimab's efficacy across all subgroups, unconstrained by PD-L1 TPS, underscores its versatility in the first-line NSCLC setting. In our opinion, the superiority demonstrated over tisle&nbsp;is particularly meaningful given that one should be able to extrapolate across other checkpoint inhibitor approved indicationsâ€¦ With more than 40,000 patients treated with ivo (3,000 in clinical trials and the remainder commercially, based on our conversation with management), potential HARMONi-2 OS data by YE25/early 2026, multiple Phase 3 trials ongoing, an accomplished team at the helm, and a strong cash position of $297.9MM, we continue to view shares as attractively valued, and we would consider any near-term weakness as an additional buying opportunity.\"</p>\n<p>These comments back up the analyst's Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on SMMT shares, while his $40 price target suggests that the stock will gain 114% in the next 12 months. (To watch Benjamin's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/reni-benjamin\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Summit has a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street's stock experts, based on 14 reviews that include 10 to Buy, 1 to Hold, and 3 to Sell. The shares are priced at $18.66, and their $30.92 average price target implies a one-year gain of 66%. (See <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smmt/forecast\"><strong>SMMT stock forecast</strong></a>)</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The U.S. agreed to lower <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-trade-u-s-to-impose-100-additional-tariff-on-chinese-goods-thefly\">some tariffs on Chinese goods.</a> The change includes cutting the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on items linked to fentanyl production from 20% to 10%. In return, China will tighten its control over the export of the chemicals used to make the drug. Trump said China is now taking \"very strong action\" on the issue. The cut will also bring the average tariff on Chinese <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> down to 47% from 57%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trade, Agriculture, and Rare Earths</strong></h2>\n<p>The two sides also found a path <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/rare-earth-stocks-surge-as-trump-revives-u-s-mining-push\">on rare-earth exports</a>. These materials are key in products from <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/electric-vehicles\">electric vehicle</a> motors to medical gear. China plans to delay new export limits for one year, which should ease pressure on U.S. manufacturers. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said the \"roadblock\" to rare-earth imports is now gone. Still, analysts expect China to keep some control measures in place.</p>\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trump-says-china-not-buying-u-s-soybeans-economically-hostile-act-thefly\">China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans</a>. The country purchased several large shipments this week, each holding about two million bushels. That move offers relief to American farmers who have struggled during the harvest season. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said the new purchases are a \"great start\" for producers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Next Steps and Market Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>Trump said a broader trade deal could come \"pretty soon.\" He also noted that the United States will delay plans for new port fees on Chinese-owned or Chinese-built vessels. The change follows <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/150-billion-south-korean-push-aims-to-rebuild-u-s-shipyards\">South Korea's pledge to invest $150 billion in U.S. shipbuilding</a>.</p>\n<p>Both leaders described the meeting as friendly. Trump plans to visit China in April, and Xi is expected to visit the United States after that.</p>\n<p>For investors, the meeting may bring short-term optimism across global markets. Lower tariffs could benefit logistics and retail firms that rely on imports, while renewed Chinese purchases may lift agricultural stocks such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company <a data-ticker=\"ADM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/adm\">(ADM)</a> and Bunge Global SA <a data-ticker=\"BG\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bg\">(BG)</a>.
