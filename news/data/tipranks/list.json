Greg Abel, age 63, a longtime Berkshire executive, will become the new CEO of the diversified holding company.</p>\n<p>Abel will write Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letter in February 2026 after assuming the CEO role. He has been handling additional duties at Berkshire Hathaway since Buffett announced in May that he is stepping down from day-to-day leadership of the company he has run since 1965.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Letter to Shareholders</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-brk-b-separates-chairman-and-ceo-roles\">At next year's annual meeting</a>, Buffett plans to sit in the audience with other board members rather than on stage and answer shareholders' questions as he has done for decades, marking a major shift in his role as the face of Berkshire Hathaway.</p>\n<p>The contents of Buffett's upcoming Nov. 10 letter remain unclear. In similar letters issued in November 2023 and 2024, he discussed estate planning, expressed gratitude for opportunities provided by the U.S., and announced various charitable donations, including to organizations run by his children. The exact contents of the upcoming letter are not known. </p>\n<p>Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial results on Nov. 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is BRK.B Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Only a couple of analysts currently offer a rating and price target on Berkshire Hathaway's more affordable Class B stock. So instead, we'll look at the shares'&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/brk.b\">three-month performance</a>. As one can see in the chart below, shares of BRK.B have risen 0.99% in the last 12 weeks.</p>",

In a post on X, he wrote that \"Apple bears owe us an explanation,\" for punishing the stock. He added that bears were wrong about Apple's lead times, store demand, and estimates.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>iPhone and Services Power Q4 Strength</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple attributed its stellar results to strong demand for the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-sees-strongest-iphone-growth-since-the-pandemic\">iPhone 17 lineup</a> and continued growth in its high-margin Services business. iPhone sales grew 6.1% year-over-year to $49 billion, while Services revenue surged 15.1%. The quarter included only two weeks of iPhone 17 sales, but early demand was strong, with reports showing it outsold the iPhone 16 by more than 14% in the first 10 days.</p>\n<p>Additionally, CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/timothy-cook\">Tim Cook</a> said that Apple expects strong holiday period sales, forecasting double-digit growth in iPhone sales and a return to growth in China.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cramer Dismisses Tech Sector Downturn</strong></h2>\n<p>Cramer also weighed in on the broader tech sector's recent decline following Meta Platforms' <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> announcement of <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-meta-msft-big-tech-fuels-ai-boom-with-aggressive-capital-spending\">higher capital expenditures on artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Despite Meta's strong earnings and revenue, its stock fell 11.3%, triggering a broader tech sell-off.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Cramer believes this weakness may be temporary. He highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-earnings-amazon-soars-after-aws-growth-helps-smash-eps-estimates\">solid quarterly performances</a> of Apple, Meta, and Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>, predicting investor confidence will soon return and money will flow back into leading tech stocks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Apple a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain divided on Apple's long-term outlook.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>During the first quarter, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> initiated a 20% <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China, citing the country's involvement in exporting the drug. As part of a trade truce reached earlier this week, he agreed to halve the tariff to 10%. Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady. Schmid warned that even a 25 bps rate cut wouldn't meaningfully affect labor market conditions but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/are-stocks-overbought-naaim-exposure-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-july-2024\">National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index</a>, which measures the exposure active investment managers have to U.S. stocks, climbed above 100 for the first time since July 2024.

The IBM team believed that this problem fit a new category they called QXC, short for \"quantum approximate counting,\" where <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ibm-and-the-basque-government-open-europes-first-ibm-quantum-system-two\">quantum computers</a> can estimate how many valid solutions exist. By using a version of phase estimation (a quantum algorithm that helps find hidden values linked to how a quantum system behaves), the researchers designed an algorithm that can handle this task far more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the work caused Mathematician Greta Panova from USC to review the findings and challenge the initial claim of a super-polynomial speedup. She ultimately disproved that bold claim but confirmed a smaller, still meaningful advantage: the quantum algorithm outperforms classical ones by a large margin when scaled. As a result, IBM researcher Vojtěch Havlíček believes that this work not only pushes quantum research forward but could also lead to new breakthroughs across both fields.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is IBM a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on IBM stock based on six Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

However, Hims promotes it as a way to support overall \"metabolic health.\"</p>\n<p>The company further stated that while GLP-1 microdosing is still a new approach that needs more research, early studies indicate these treatments could offer benefits beyond just weight management.

Now, Ford is looking to get that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/this-time-its-windshield-related-ford-stock-nysef-slips-with-latest-multi-recall-burst\">factory back online</a>, and will put the roughly $370 million in question to work in aid of that. Located in Tamil Nadu, the Maraimalai Nagar site is looking to put out over 200,000 engines per year. Interestingly, the engines are not meant to come back to the United States, but it is unclear just where the engines will go.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Ford had an opportunity to set up a different deal back in 2020, when Jim Farley first became CEO of Ford. It was set to make a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd., which in turn would have kept Ford vehicles in play in India. But since India was then considered a \"marginal\" market, like Brazil, Ford decided to pull back and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/moonroof-defect-ford-stock-nysef-slips-on-new-power-company-plan\">keep its capital</a> instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>China Can \"Put Us All Out of Business\"</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jim Farley is also deeply concerned about the state of the global market, believing the very real possibility that China could put every American automaker out of business. Farley noted that China currently has enough production capacity to cover the entire North American market, which would render Ford and its contemporaries largely extraneous in their own backyard.</p>\n<p>Farley compared this development to the Japanese car market of the 1980s, which was significant, but even back then, much smaller. China's industrial potential is staggering, and this poses what Farley called \"…a completely different level of risk for our industry.\" This in turn prompted several changes at Ford, though it remains to be seen if these will be sufficient.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, nine Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 27.79% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f/forecast\">average F price target</a> of $12.14 per share implies 7.65% downside risk.</p>",
