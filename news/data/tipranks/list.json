            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/perplexity\">Perplexity</a> has launched a new product called Perplexity Computer, and it may signal a shift in how <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> firms aim to grow. The company says the tool can handle full projects from start to finish by using a group of AI models at the same time. For now, it is <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/private-companies/perplexity-launches-multi-model-ai-platform-for-subscription-users\">open to Max users who pay $200 per month</a>, with added usage fees based on how much they run it.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A New Kind of AI Setup</strong></h2>\n<p>Perplexity says the system runs 19 models in parallel, with each one assigned a clear role. As CEO, Aravind Srinivas wrote, \"One reason, another codes, another writes.\" He also said, \"Perplexity Computer orchestrates 19 models.\" In short, the product works like a manager that gives each AI model a task it does best.</p>\n<p>In addition, the system links to a file base, browser, and other tools. That means it can research, design, code, and deploy a project in one flow. The firm says the goal is to let AI run tasks in the cloud even while the user is offline. Srinivas framed it this way: \"AI essentially becomes the Computer.\"</p>\n<p>As a result, Perplexity is moving past search and into task control. Rather than just answer a prompt, the system aims to manage a full job. That could make it more useful for founders, coders, and firms that want AI to save time and cut costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing, Rivals, and Market Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>For now, Perplexity Computer is tied to the Max plan at $200 per month, plus usage fees. Srinivas said this is \"the right business model for AI instead of ads.\" That comment may hint at a push to avoid the ad model used by Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, and is destined for OpenAI users. Instead, Perplexity is leaning on direct user pay, much like other AI tools that target pro users.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the launch adds more pressure to the race among AI firms. Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> backs <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\">OpenAI</a> and has built AI tools into its cloud and Office suite. Alphabet is pushing Gemini across its search and Android base. Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-delivers-another-ai-fueled-beat-so-why-was-the-stock-reaction-so-modest\">powers much of the chip side of the AI boom</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/anthropic\">Anthropic</a> and other model labs are also building tools that can plan and run tasks.</p>\n<p>Perplexity's approach stands out because it does not rely on one model. Instead, it pulls in models from several labs and assigns each one a role. That could help it adjust cost and speed based on the task. However, it also means Perplexity depends on access to outside models.</p>\n<p>In parallel, the firm is set to gain more reach. Samsung <a data-ticker=\"SSNLF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">(SSNLF)</a> is expected to add the Perplexity assistant to its Galaxy S26 line, with the wake phrase \"Hey Plex.\" If that move takes hold in the U.S. and abroad, it could give Perplexity a wider base of users.</p>\n<p>Overall, Perplexity Computer shows how AI firms are trying to move from chat to action. Rather than just provide answers, they want AI to run projects and manage tools.</p>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=GOOGL&amp;ticker=META&amp;ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=BABA&amp;ticker=TCEHY&amp;ticker=GOOG\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare notable publicly traded companies that employ chatbots similar to ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude. It's an excellent tool to gain a broader perspective on each stock and the AI industry as a whole.</p>",

He pushed back on the idea that AI will cannibalize software firms. Instead, he argued that AI agents will use existing tools to get work done. \"That's the reason why we also say agents are tool users,\" Huang said.</p>\n<p>He pointed to products from Cadence Design Systems <a data-ticker=\"CDNS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cdns\">(CDNS)</a>, Synopsys <a data-ticker=\"SNPS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/snps\">(SNPS)</a>, ServiceNow <a data-ticker=\"NOW\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/now\">(NOW)</a>, and SAP <a data-ticker=\"SAP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sap\">(SAP)</a>. According to Huang, these tools exist for a good reason and will remain core to business work. \"These agentic AIs will be intelligent software that uses these tools on our behalf and helps us be more productive,\" he said.</p>\n<p>In other words, AI may sit on top of current systems rather than replace them. Agents could log into ServiceNow, update SAP, or run models in Cadence and Synopsys just like a human would, only faster.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, NVDA shares <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">rose 1.41% on Wednesday</a> and just under 1% in pre-market trading, despite the strong results. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",
