According to IDC, this would mark the biggest-ever decline for the smartphone market, <em>Reuters</em> reported. Nonetheless, IDC expects Apple <a data-ticker=\"AAPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">(AAPL)</a> and Samsung <a data-ticker=\"SSNLF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">(SSNLF)</a> to gain market share despite the ongoing challenges.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IDC Warns of Sharp Decline in Smartphone Shipments</strong></h2>\n<p>IDC believes that large players such as Apple and Samsung have solid balance sheets and premium positioning in the smartphone market. This would shield them from the ongoing memory crisis compared to smaller players. Notably, IDC expects low-end Android phone makers to be the most affected. Meanwhile, IDC projects that the average selling price of smartphones will rise by 14% to $523 in 2026, as smartphone makers move toward higher-margin models to mitigate rising costs.</p>\n<p>Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Mobile Phone Tracker, cautioned that the ongoing rise in memory chip prices will not just result in a temporary drop in smartphone shipments, but will lead to a \"structural reset\" of the entire market. Specifically, Popal expects the sub-$100 smartphone segment, which comprises 171 million devices, to become \"permanently uneconomical\" even after memory prices stabilize by mid-2027.</p>\n<p>Memory chip prices have been rising as tech giants like Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, and Meta Platforms <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> have been securing much of the supply as they invest aggressively to build <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AAPL Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Last month, Apple reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple-stock-rises-after-firm-smashes-estimates\">upbeat results for the December quarter</a>, reflecting resilience amid challenging business conditions and intense competition. The company generated a 23% surge in its iPhone revenue, driven by solid demand for the iPhone 17 models released in September 2025. While the company experienced minimal impact from memory prices in the December quarter, it expects a greater impact in the March quarter.</p>\n<p>Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock based on 17 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">AAPL stock price target</a> of $307.55 indicates 12.7% upside potential.</p>",

Traditional wet labs test roughly 2,000 molecular ideas per target annually, while LillyPod lets scientists explore billions of hypotheses in parallel in the \"dry lab.\"</p>\n<p>LillyPod uses nearly 5,000 fiber cable connections, weighing over 1,000 pounds, for its links.

LillyPod went live on day one, fueling applications in genomics, molecule and peptide design, single-cell biology, imaging, manufacturing, and enterprise operations. This builds on Lilly and Nvidia's recent co-innovation lab in South San Francisco, reflecting Lilly's push beyond pilots to enterprise-scale AI with robust talent, governance, and responsible AI frameworks.</p>\n<p>LillyPod signals pharma's AI arms race, where rivals like Pfizer <a data-ticker=\"PFE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pfe\">(PFE)</a> and Sanofi <a data-ticker=\"SNY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sny\">(SNY)</a> have also partnered with Nvidia, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/how-jnj-tem-and-lly-used-ai-to-redefine-healthcare-compounding\">potentially slashing drug discovery timelines</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is LLY Stock Worth Buying?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain highly optimistic about Eli Lilly's long-term prospects. On TipRanks, LLY stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys and three Hold ratings. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\">average Eli Lilly price target of $1,261</a> implies 23.4% upside potential from current levels.
