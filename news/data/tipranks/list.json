            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Harte said that during the Q3 2025 earnings call, Saylor described how Strategy is building what he called a \"credit factory,\" a set of products that let investors choose different levels of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> exposure. The company now has four preferred equity offerings, each giving investors a different balance of risk and return. Harte said this approach effectively builds a Bitcoin yield curve, letting investors pick how much exposure they want.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q3 Earnings Snapshot</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The company posted <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/mstr-earnings-strategys-financial-results-beat-on-top-and-bottom-lines\">better-than-expected Q3 results</a>, driven by strong gains from its Bitcoin holdings and higher revenue from its core business. It reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $8.42 per share</a>, beating estimates of $7.90, on revenue of $128.7 million, which topped forecasts of $116.35 million. Notably, the company now owns about 640,808 BTC, valued at roughly $70.9 billion at current prices, with an average purchase cost of $74,032 per coin.</p>\n<p>During the quarter, Strategy Inc. also increased its dividend rate to 10.5% for its Series A Preferred Stock to attract more investor demand. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor called this an \"inflection point\" for the company, as it continues to expand funding options tied to its growing Bitcoin strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Highlights Growth Potential</strong></h2>\n<p>The analyst noted that Strategy is widening its reach by developing new credit products and introducing international securities. The company's recent B- credit rating from S&amp;P Global will let it tap into the high-yield market, giving it more ways to raise capital beyond equity sales.</p>\n<p>Despite the stock being down 37% year to date, Harte said Strategy's valuation looks attractive, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/statistics\">trading at about 1.3 times its modified net asset value</a>, well below its long-term average of 2.1 times. He said this gives investors a good entry point into one of the purest public Bitcoin plays.</p>\n<p>Harte believes that while Bitcoin's price swings may keep short-term pressure on the stock, Strategy's growing funding options and product lineup make it better positioned for the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR Stock a&nbsp;Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr\">MSTR stock</a>&nbsp;has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buys and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\">average MSTR price target&nbsp;</a>of $532.84 implies a 109.31% upside from current levels.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>While those gains are fostering an optimistic mood on Wall Street, some voices are counseling caution. Writing from Bank of America, strategist Savita Subramanian notes that there are bearish signals out there, and that investors should take care.</p>\n<p>\"Our bear market signposts – the triggers that typically precede an S&amp;P 500 peak – suggest additional caution. Today, 60% of our signposts are triggered, just below the average of 70% before prior market peaks… Historical comparisons are problematic, as today's S&amp;P is higher quality, asset light, less levered, etc. But risks are mounting and the valuation floor for the S&amp;P 500 is likely lower than today's levels… Be selective,\" Subramanian opined.</p>\n<p>That last line might be the key. Bank of America's stock analysts are being selective – and they are selecting stocks where they still see value ahead. We've used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a> to look up the broader Wall Street view on two of these BofA picks. Let's dive in.</p>\n<p><strong>Doximity</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/docs/forecast\"><strong>DOCS</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>We'll start with a look at Doximity, a professional networking platform oriented toward the medical field and health-care industry. Doximity's core user base is physicians and other direct care providers, who can use the platform to connect with each other, follow medical news, communicate via a secure app that is considered HIPAA-compliant, and even contact patients via video call. The company points out that modern medicine is mobile – and it has designed its platform to facilitate mobility in ways that benefit clinicians and patients.</p>\n<p>Doximity bills itself as the largest online network for medical clinicians in the US healthcare sector. The company boasts that 80% of US physicians, as well as 50% of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are verified members of the network. By connecting them, with the ease and convenience of a mobile app, Doximity makes it easier for medical professionals to collaborate on patient care and to disseminate new developments in the field.</p>\n<p>The increase in demand for medical services over the past decade or more has forced providers to look for alternative ways to keep abreast of new developments, meet with patients, confer with specialists – and has expanded the field of telemedicine. The Doximity app, which allows providers to speak directly with patients via video link, streamlines the process. Providers can set online call appointments, tend to other work, and receive alerts as callers – patients or colleagues – enter the conversation.</p>\n<p>All of this requires a solid tech backing, and in August of this year Doximity announced that it had acquired Pathway Medical, a Canadian company that specializes in developing medical <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and evidence-based clinical reference systems. Doximity paid $36 million for Pathway, and the acquisition brings the Montreal-based firm's physician-centered AI and datasets into Doximity's suite of assets.</p>\n<p>On the financial side, Doximity reported results for fiscal 1Q26 this past August. The company kicked off its fiscal year with $145.9 million in revenue, a total that was up 15% year-over-year and came in $6.36 million ahead of the estimates. The company had a quarterly non-GAAP EPS of 36 cents, up from 28 cents one year earlier – and a nickel better than the forecast. Doximity also reported a 52% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, to $60.1 million.</p>\n<p>Bank of America analyst Allen Lutz sees a shift in the healthcare industry as a net gain for Doximity. He notes that regulatory reforms are promoting ad spending toward provider channels – and that Doximity is perfectly positioned to reap gains from that trend. Lutz says of the company, \"The FDA's recent reforms to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising are adding friction in that channel, and pharmaceutical manufacturers are beginning to shift spend away from the DTC channel and toward the healthcare provider (HCP) channel. The combination of recent manufacturer decisions (Alnylam) and this quarter's survey results gives us confidence that Doximity's 4Q'25 budget flush will be significantly above Street expectations and that revenue growth can potentially accelerate in CY26. We see substantial upside revision risk with the Street currently expecting a three year revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 11%/12%, respectively.\"</p>\n<p>These comments support Lutz's Buy rating on DOCS, while his $82 price target suggests that the stock will gain ~24.5% by this time next year. (To watch Lutz's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/allen-lutz\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, the Moderate Buy consensus rating on Doximity shares is based on 17 reviews that include 10 to Buy, 5 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The stock is currently trading for $65.82, and its $71.38 average target price implies a one-year gain of 8.5%. (See <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/docs/forecast\"><strong>DOCS stock forecast</strong></a>)</p>",

Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\" Burry also changed his profile name to \"Cassandra Unchained,\" referencing the Greek mythological figure cursed to make true predictions that no one would believe, a fitting parallel to Burry's history of issuing ignored but accurate warnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Michael Burry Shorting the Market?</strong></h2>\n<p>Burry rose to fame for shorting the U.S. housing market in the mid-2000s, earning billions for himself and his investors when the bubble burst in 2008. He analyzed the risky subprime mortgages and used credit default swaps to bet against the housing market. This contrarian bet was famously depicted in the book and film <em>The Big Short</em>.</p>\n<p>Although Burry has not specified which \"bubble\" he sees now, much speculation points to the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-meta-msft-big-tech-fuels-ai-boom-with-aggressive-capital-spending\">technology sector and its massive bets</a> on <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). His latest comments suggest that he is currently neither shorting nor buying the market, opting instead to remain on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>The surging demand for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chips has boosted Nvidia's <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-nvda-rockets-to-historic-5-trillion-valuation-on-gtc-strength\">market capitalization to over $5 trillion</a> as of October 29, greater than the GDPs of countries like India, Japan, and Germany. Several experts have warned that an \"AI bubble\" may be forming as companies pour billions into data centers and AI infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bulls vs. Bears</strong></h2>\n<p>Burry's warning comes amid heated <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/billionaire-ray-dalio-warns-that-a-bubble-is-forming-and-explains-why-it-wont-pop-yet\">debate over whether the big AI-driven boom</a> in tech stocks is real progress or just a risky bubble.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reddit Rises Above Wall Street</strong></h2>\n<p>RDDT stock <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\">backpedaled from a nearly 8% drop</a> from the previous day, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\">rising more than 11%</a> to $216.20 per share on Friday as of 6:37 a.m., as investors began to digest the latest financial results. </p>\n<p>In its third-quarter results, the California-based company <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt/earnings\">saw sales jump 68%</a> from the same period last year, hitting $585 million and surpassing analysts' forecast of $549.12 million. It also recorded total daily active uniques (DAUq) of 116 million, up 19% year-over-year. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wall Street Rains Praise on Reddit</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings, Wall Street analysts on Friday showered RDDT stock with price boosts and Buy ratings. According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-colantuoni\">Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni</a>, who maintained his $300 price target on Reddit — more than 50% upside — the \"commanding\" performance emphasizes the social media company's \"attractive opportunity\" to drive increased advertisers' spending. </p>\n<p>This comes from platform enhancement, the introduction of new products, and designs that make the platform easier to use. Colantuoni believes that while Reddit's growth matches its peers, this state is not yet reflected in its stock market value.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/andrew-boone\">Citizens analyst Andrew Boone</a>, who maintains the same price target as Colantouni, hailed Reddit's advertising strategy and further emphasized that the social news aggregator remains \"increasingly important\" to the open web ecosystem as search engines and chatbots rely on its content. </p>\n<p>Among other factors, Boone, who is a five-star analyst, sees the addition of Answers — an&nbsp;AI-powered feature that collates and summarizes responses to users' queries — as Reddit's default search function to be \"a significant\" catalyst for next year. Boone also pointed out that the introduction of machine translation across international markets is helping Reddit gain more users. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Google a Threat to Reddit?</strong></h2>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/brad-erickson\"></a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/firms/rbc-capital\">RBC Capital</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.streetinsider.com/entities/Mark+Zuckerberg\"></a>analyst Brad Erickson, who maintained his $245 price target with a Sector Perform (Hold) rating, pointed out that slowing growth in the number of daily active users might amplify the arguments of bearish analysts.</p>\n<p>Skeptics have raised concerns about Reddit's future in the face of Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> Google generative <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> solutions. As a case study, Erickson pointed to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-earnings-alphabet-jumps-after-smashing-q3-estimates\">the strong adoption of Google's new AI Mode</a>, reported in its Q3 results released on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the five-star analyst said his team is still awaiting clarity on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/reddit-rddt-seeks-new-ai-content-deal-with-google\">whether Reddit will renew its AI deal with Google</a> and resolve wider industry concerns related to this partnership.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Reddit a Strong Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>While analysts have started to reassess their ratings and price targets on<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rddt\"> Reddit's stock</a>, they are still early into this process. However, based on 24 ratings over the past three months, Reddit's shares currently have a Moderate Buy consensus recommendation.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Indicators Hint at a Rebound</strong></h2>\n<p>On the 4-hour chart, XRP bounced off support at $2.39 and is testing resistance near $2.53. Both the Money Flow Index (MFI) and the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd/technical-analysis\">Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest</a> selling pressure is easing. The MFI sits near 30, a zone that often precedes fresh accumulation, while the RSI, now rising from 41, signals that bearish momentum is losing strength.</p>\n<p>This shift in tone could mark the early stages of a trend reversal. If buying volume holds, traders see a path toward the upper end of the current range, with $2.72 acting as the next key resistance level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>ETF Approval Hopes Boost Sentiment</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Optimism is also being driven by the CanaryFunds XRP spot ETF, now expected to debut on Nov. 13. The recent removal of the SEC's delay amendment has lifted sentiment across the market and sparked renewed institutional interest.</p>\n<p>As <em><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">Crypto</a> In America</em> journalist Eleanor Terrett reported, \"CanaryFunds has filed an updated S-1 for its XRP spot ETF, removing the 'delaying amendment' that stops a registration from going auto-effective and gives the SEC control over timing.\"</p>\n<p>This procedural change clears the way for the ETF to move forward without further SEC holdups. If the fund launches as planned, it could channel new capital into the market right as XRP shows early signs of technical recovery, which is a mix that traders say could finally help the token retest the $3 mark.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Momentum Builds across Timeframes</strong></h2>\n<p>On the daily chart, the MACD has turned bullish, with the 12-day EMA crossing above the 20-day EMA and histogram bars turning green. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is also trending upward, pointing to strengthening inflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">At $2.50, XRP sits near a key Fibonacci level</a>. A confirmed breakout above $2.72 could open a path toward $3.26, while failure to hold above $2.22 would risk another pullback. At the current moment, imomentum appears to be shifting in the bulls' favor and after months of sideways trading, XRP may finally be ready to move again.</p>",

He highlighted that fundamental trends were generally positive in Q3, with top-line growth consistent with the second quarter and operating margin at record highs.</p>\n<p>Among the key takeaways, Mahaney noted the 20% year-over-year AWS growth was the fastest in 11 quarters, with the quarter-over-quarter growth in dollars handily outpacing Azure for the first time since the third quarter of 2022. He also pointed out that the backlog reached $200 billion and that October deal volume was greater than all of Q3. Furthermore, Trainium2 revenue surged 150% quarter over quarter. \"The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> narrative has flipped positive for AWS,\" said Mahaney.</p>\n<p>Mahaney also mentioned the robust performance of Amazon's retail business, citing \"very consistent\" double-digit revenue growth in North America and International segments. Interestingly, Amazon stated that its shopping chatbot Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Finally, Mahaney highlighted the rapid growth in Amazon's advertising revenue.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Canaccord Analyst Sees More Upside in AMZN Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>Canaccord Genuity&nbsp;analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/maria-ripps\">Maria Ripps</a> increased the price target for Amazon stock to $300 from $280 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. The 5-star analyst stated that in what was a pivotal quarter for AWS amid rising investor concerns about its business lagging in AI-centric workloads, the cloud unit saw its growth accelerate about 270 basis points quarter-over-quarter to over 20%, representing the segment's largest growth rate in 11 quarters. Ripps noted the robust backlog at the end of Q3 and the addition of more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, with another gigawatt anticipated to come online in Q4, and management expecting to double power capacity by 2027.</p>\n<p>Ripps highlighted the surge in Trainum2 revenue and stated that it is now a \"fully subscribed, multibillion-dollar business.\" Further, Trainum3, which is expected to be 40% more cost-efficient, is on track to be previewed at the end of the year, with management expecting it to drive demand from medium-sized businesses.</p>\n<p>The top-rated analyst also noted the strength in online stores, with momentum in Everyday Essentials, and sequential acceleration in advertising revenue growth by 60 basis points amid momentum with Prime Video and Amazon DSP. Given greater visibility into further AWS acceleration in Q4 and 2026, Ripps expects AMZN stock to gain momentum as investor confidence rebuilds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>With 41 unanimous Buys, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock. The average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">AMZN stock price target</a> of $269.24 indicates 21% upside potential.</p>",
