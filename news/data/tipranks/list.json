Warner executives did not rush to answer that question, but instead presented a look at what was likely to be coming in the near future. One of the big points was the future of the Warner cable channels. From CNN to TNT to Discovery and the rest, Warner declared that the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/graceful-exit-netflix-stock-nasdaqnflx-surges-as-deal-doubts-emerge\">spinoff was going well</a>. In fact, HBO was looking forward to around 10 years' worth of marketing coming up as the Harry Potter series started up.</p>\n<p>Gaming, meanwhile, would take a bit of a backseat for a while, Expensive flops like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> proved to be a problem. Warner's gaming got \"…distracted going after too many IP with too broad a set of studios.\" But the real win would be the film studios, which were poised for a \"stunning\" year going into 2027. Warner managed to land nine major hits in the last 14 months, reports noted.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>But Then The Numbers Hit</strong></h2>\n<p>Even as Warner made it clear its future looked great, its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/wbd-earnings-warner-bros-discovery-stock-slides-as-q4-eps-misses-estimates-revenue-drops\">fourth quarter of 2025</a> figures were a bit of a downer. Warner posted total revenue of $9.46 billion, and boasted 131.6 million subscribers on its HBO Max operations. Yet, despite all that, Warner still managed to post a quarterly loss of $252 million.</p>\n<p>Overall revenue was also down, about 6% against 2024's fourth quarter. Advertising revenue dropped 9%, and half of that loss went to the loss of the NBA broadcasts on its own. Global linear networks dropped another 12%, which makes it abundantly clear why Warner is looking to spin them off, and may also explain why valuing the linear channels has proven to be such a sticking point lately.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is WBD Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on four Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 162.73% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd/forecast\">average WBD price target</a> of $29.66 per share implies 2.9% upside potential.</p>",

Reports suggest that Uptime Assist has cut repair times by between 10% and 15%. This means time and money saved for customers, particularly those who own and manage fleets. Ford dealerships already carry out 35 million repairs a year as it is, so improvements of even seconds will save huge volumes of cumulative man-hours.</p>\n<p>Ford is still pushing toward a goal of same-day <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/very-exciting-plans-for-europe-ford-stock-nysef-lands-fractional-gain-on-passenger-car-plans\">customer repairs</a>. Though it is not there yet, reports note it is closing in. One key feature allows dealerships to call for help from Ford itself, seeking additional technical support or parts ordering assistance.

A frunk is now an optional feature on the Mach-E, which will cost customers $495 to have included.</p>\n<p>Ford decided to charge for it because, apparently, customers were not particularly interested in this block of empty space. Thus, Ford cut it as a standard feature, allowing it to stay as a paid option. Response to this notion has been mixed, with some wondering why they now need to pay to make a section of space that was really only <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-customer-has-spoken-ford-stock-nysef-slips-as-ford-promises-priority-shift\">usable for storage</a> actually usable for storage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, 12 Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

In fact, exploiting software vulnerabilities became the number-one way hackers break in, accounting for 40% of incidents in 2025. </p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Interestingly, IBM says that attackers are not inventing brand-new methods, but instead <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/hacker-jailbreaks-claude-ai-to-steal-150gb-of-mexican-government-data\">are using </a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> to speed up old tactics. At the same time, ransomware attacks, where criminals lock systems and demand payment, are becoming more common and more chaotic. IBM found that the number of active ransomware groups rose 49% from the previous year, while reported victims increased by about 12%. Much of this growth comes from smaller criminal groups using stolen hacking tools and step-by-step guides, which makes it easier for newcomers to launch attacks. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, AI services themselves are becoming targets. In 2025, malware exposed more than 300,000 ChatGPT login credentials, which could allow attackers to manipulate responses, steal sensitive data, or inject malicious instructions. In addition, attacks on supply chains and partner systems are rising sharply. Large breaches involving third-party software providers have nearly quadrupled since 2020. Experts also warn that poorly reviewed AI-assisted code may increase this risk if it makes its way into real systems. The report also found that manufacturing was the most targeted industry, making up 27.7% of incidents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is IBM a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on IBM stock based on 12 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm/forecast\">average IBM price target</a>&nbsp;of $334.18 per share implies 37.8% upside potential.</p>",

Sub-Saharan Africa is set to see its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/boeing-stock-nyseba-slips-as-737-max-delivery-count-emerges\">economic output</a> grow about 4.6%, as compared with the 3.3% expected by the rest of the world.

Other firms have tried to enter the market, but are basically niche firms at best.

The lower rates arrive just ahead of spring, a period that typically sees increased home-buying activity. \"With a sub-6% rate, we'll get reliable sales growth across the country,\" said Compass Chief Economist Mike Simonsen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Higher Costs May Limit Housing Demand</strong></h2>\n<p>Others aren't so sure that lower rates will lead to higher demand. Whelan Advisory CEO Margaret Whelan notes that consumer sentiment remains subdued alongside a labor market that has shown signs of weakening. In addition, both electricity and home insurance costs have risen, making it more expensive to own a home.</p>\n<p>Economists expect rates to stay in the high 5% to low 6% range for the remainder of the year. Fannie Mae (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fnma\">FNMA</a>) expects an average rate of 6%, while the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts a 6.1% rate.</p>",

The fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and was created in the 1990s to invest profits from Norway's oil and gas industry.

More specifically, these tools can flag potential risks within 24 hours of a new investment, such as links to forced labor, corruption, or fraud, even if major news outlets have not reported them yet. In some cases, the fund was able to sell investments before the broader market reacted, thereby helping it avoid losses. </p>\n<p>However, the fund's ethical decisions have also caused controversy. For example, last year it sold shares in companies such as Caterpillar <a data-ticker=\"CAT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cat\">(CAT)</a> and several Israeli banks, which drew criticism from U.S. officials who questioned the reasoning behind the move. Norway's finance minister insisted that the decision was not political, but the backlash led to temporary changes to how companies can be excluded while the ethical framework was reviewed. Nevertheless, NBIM claims that sustainability and governance risks are closely tied to long-term financial performance. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Claude Investors Have Seen Huge Gains</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/anthropic\">Anthropic investors have seen huge gains during the past few months</a>&nbsp;as the company's valuation has increased from $183 billion to $380 billion.
