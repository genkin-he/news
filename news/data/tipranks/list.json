Each stock currently has a dividend payout ratio of at least 50%, meaning that each company recently distributed at least half of its net earnings to shareholders as dividends. Furthermore, each company currently has a Buy rating based on consensus from top analysts or broader Wall Street agreement, with significant upside potential.</p>\n<p>Be sure to click on any ticker to thoroughly research the stock before you decide whether to add it to your portfolio. Here are today's top dividend aristocrat stock picks from TipRanks.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>International Business Machines</strong> <a data-ticker=\"IBM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm\">(IBM)</a> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">— IBM is a prominent American technology company known for its efforts in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/quantum-computing\">quantum computing</a>. The company also provides hybrid cloud, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>, and consulting services. </span>The New York-based company currently has a dividend payout ratio of 58.08%. IBM paid $1.68 per share in its last dividend issuance, with a dividend yield of 2.93%. Its shares currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating from 18 Wall Street analysts, with an average price target of $334.18, which implies about 38% upside.</li>\n<li><strong>Abbott Laboratories</strong> <a data-ticker=\"ABT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/abt\">(ABT)</a>&nbsp;— This is a long-running American healthcare company that produces and sells pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutritional products, as well as medical devices. The Illinois-based company currently has a dividend payout ratio of 142.45%. It paid 49 cents per share in its last dividend issuance, with a dividend yield of 2.09%.

This trait is especially attractive to investors who favor steadily rising cash distributions over reacting to near-term volatility in share prices.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, newly spun-off businesses are welcomed into this group when they are judged to have effectively inherited their former parent company's long-standing track record of consistent dividend growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interested in More Dividend Aristocrat Stocks?</strong></h2>\n<p>To find more stocks like these, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dividends/dividend-aristocrats\">TipRanks' Dividend Aristocrats tool</a>.</p>\n<p>The page provides an exhaustive list of all dividend aristocrats, including their most recent dividend yields, previous dividend amounts, payout ratios, and other details.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Tech giant Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> may not immediately <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-50-billion-in-openai\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-50-billion-in-openai\">invest the full $50 billion it has been discussing</a> with <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\"><strong>OpenAI</strong></a>. As reported by <em>The Information</em>, most of the funding would depend on whether OpenAI goes public or it reaches artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which refers to <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> systems that can handle many tasks at a level close to human reasoning.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Under the reported terms, Amazon would invest about $15 billion upfront, while the remaining $35 billion would be released if OpenAI either goes public or reaches the AGI milestone.</p>\n<p>The proposed investment is part of OpenAI's current funding round, which could exceed $100 billion and value the company at about $730 billion before financing. Other large investors are also preparing commitments. Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> and SoftBank <a data-ticker=\"SFTBY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sftby\">(SFTBY)</a> are each expected to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/softbank-to-invest-30b-more-in-openais-new-830b-funding-round\">invest roughly $30 billion in stages as part of the same round</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Amazon Set These Conditions</strong></h2>\n<p>The new structure shows that Amazon wants clear proof before committing most of its money. An IPO would give OpenAI a market value and tradable shares. Meanwhile, an AGI milestone would mean the company's systems can perform many tasks instead of only generating text, images, or code.</p>\n<p>The talks are also linked to a broader cloud deal between the companies. OpenAI is discussing expanding its earlier $38 billion cloud agreement with Amazon and may use Amazon's Trainium chips to train its AI models.</p>\n<p>Currently, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> has exclusive rights to host OpenAI's models on its Azure cloud platform. That exclusivity could change if OpenAI reaches AGI, which would allow the company to offer its models on other cloud providers, including Amazon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How the Agreement Could Help Amazon Compete with Rivals</strong></h2>\n<p>For Amazon, the deal is closely tied to its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services. Microsoft already benefits from its partnership with OpenAI through the Azure cloud platform. A stronger relationship with OpenAI could help Amazon draw more developers and business customers that are building AI tools and services.</p>\n<p>The payment structure also reduces risk. Amazon gains a position in the AI market now but commits most of its money only if OpenAI goes public or reaches the AGI milestone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 40 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">average AMZN price target</a>&nbsp;of $282.21 per share implies 33.98% upside potential.</p>",

Some love it. Some hate it. And some would rather the whole thing was never an issue to begin with. But it is here, and it even has a new feature some have been waiting for for a long time now: Active Noise Cancellation. This feature will be coming out soon, reports note, but that did little to help Tesla shares today. Shares dropped nearly 3% in Thursday afternoon's trading.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Tesla recently added Active Noise Cancellation to its feature list, This was a bit of a surprise as it turns out Cybertrucks have always had the necessary hardware to activate the feature, but it was simply never actually started. In fact, Tesla vehicles have been using noise cancellation since 2021, with the Model S and Model X.</p>\n<p>The Active Noise Cancellation system uses a combination of microphones and speakers to detect road noise and then generate a kind of \"anti-noise\" at a frequency appropriate to basically muffle the sound coming in. The result is a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/thats-not-investing-thats-speculation-tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-gains-despite-bearish-outlook-on-optimus\">quieter driving experience</a>, particularly for those in the front seats. Interestingly, the Model S and Model X had six microphones to do that job, but the Cybertruck only has four.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where Scrapped Cybertrucks Go</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, an unexpected wrinkle showed up, as Tesla revealed what happens to scrapped Cybertrucks. It turns out that the diner Tesla built out in Hollywood is actually built using \"…recycled stainless steel from <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-tsla-rolls-out-its-grok-ai-assistant-to-australia-and-new-zealand-drivers\">Cybertruck production</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The diner has proven a bit controversial—why is Tesla in the food service industry to begin with?—but considering that it also offers 80 V4 charging stalls, it is a welcome port in a storm. Diners can not only recharge their cars, but also get food, and view movies from screens in the parking lot or on the rooftop patio known as the Skypad. The fact that the diner is actually made with recycled materials certainly does not hurt matters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy, Hold or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 48.04% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">average TSLA price target</a> of $396.80 per share implies 1.85% downside risk.</p>",

Revenue is anticipated to increase by 101% to $1.5 billion.</p>\n<p>However, Evercore's Amit Daryanani, an analyst ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, believes the company can beat that figure given what he views as a \"de-risked setup.\" Recall that in the prior quarter management reduced its CY25 revenue guide to account for temporary delays in delivering powered-shell data center capacity in Q4.</p>\n<p>He also sees potential to outperform the Street's $138 million EBIT forecast, though EPS may be harder to model accurately as CRWV continues investing to scale operations.</p>\n<p>For the December quarter, Daryanani thinks investor attention will center on the schedule for powered-shell data center deliveries, progress in locking in incremental long-term capacity and the funding environment – with the broadened NVIDIA partnership viewed as a supportive factor – as well as the read-through for CY26 revenue.</p>\n<p>Recent reporting referencing internal memos about a \"chip delivery milestone\" at a facility in Denton, Texas, indicated that more than 16,000 GPUs were operational by late December and that total data center capacity could approach roughly 850 MW by year-end. Against that backdrop, the analyst thinks the Q1 Street revenue forecast of about $2.3 billion appears attainable. Daryanani sees the Q4 backlog landing in the mid-to-high $50 billion range, largely unchanged from Q3, as the company prioritizes securing additional data center capacity, with revenue primarily constrained by supply rather than demand.</p>\n<p>Additional topics investors will be monitoring include the transition from Blackwell to Rubin and how the ramp timing could affect revenue; availability of powered-shell data center capacity, including updates on self-built facilities; and the strategy to generate revenue from software offerings such as SUNK and Mission Control by selling them to other cloud providers. Overall, while strong demand and the debate over GPU useful life – with several data points suggesting GPUs can remain productive for more than 10 years – are well understood, the 5-star analyst thinks attention has increasingly shifted toward CRWV's ability to secure the capacity required to sustain future expansion.</p>\n<p>All told, Daryanani maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $160 price target that points toward 12-month returns of 65%. (To watch Daryanani's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/amit-daryanani\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The rest of the Street's ratings splits into an even 8 Buys and Holds, each, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $118.57, the average target implies shares will gain 22% over the one-year timeframe. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">See CRWV stock forecast</a>)</p>",

In addition, the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> leader provided fiscal first quarter revenue guidance of $78 billion, plus or minus 2%, which was above the estimate of $72.6 billion as well.</p>\n<p>However, the results weren't good enough for investors, with <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-is-the-stock-market-down-today-2-26-26\">NVDA selling off amid continued fears of a bubble in AI</a>.

            "title": "PayPal Stock Sinks after Report Says Stripe Isn't Interested in a Takeover",
            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Despite recent rumors, PayPal <a data-ticker=\"PYPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl\">(PYPL)</a> is not actively seeking a buyer and is not in <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-paypal-stock-pypl-soars-as-stripe-considers-a-potential-acquisition\">negotiations with Stripe</a> or any other company. Instead, insiders say that the fintech firm has been quietly preparing for months to defend itself against potential activist investors or hostile takeover attempts, according to <em>Semafor</em>. This precautionary move came after a sharp drop in PayPal's stock price raised concerns that the company could become vulnerable. Although <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that Stripe has explored acquiring PayPal, the company has declined to comment on the speculation.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>However, even if Stripe wanted to proceed, pulling off such a deal would be extremely challenging. Because Stripe is privately owned, it cannot use publicly traded shares as currency in a merger, which is how many large acquisitions are financed. Instead, it would need an enormous amount of debt financing to fund a cash purchase, especially if PayPal resisted. Deals of this scale between private buyers and public targets are rare and often require complex financial engineering. </p>\n<p>Still, the strategic logic behind the interest is easy to understand. PayPal controls a large network of users and payment infrastructure that is deeply embedded in global commerce, making it a highly attractive asset for any major fintech player. However, any meaningful discussions would likely have to wait until PayPal's leadership transition settles and the company clarifies its long-term strategy. For now, the firm appears focused on protecting its independence rather than entertaining offers, which caused its stock to drop in today's trading.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PYPL Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on PYPL stock based on five Buys, 26 Holds, and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl/forecast\">average PYPL price target</a> of $51.35 per share implies 13.5% upside potential.</p>",

In a bizarre kind of way, that kind of outstanding performance has become par for the course for the chip giant, and investors' reaction to the print has been a negative one, with shares down 5% in Thursday's trading as of writing. Right now, the market seems reluctant to reward anything <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-related, no matter the strength on display.</p>\n<p>The Street's biggest NVDA bull, however, has no such issues. \"We view the risk/reward positive post a beat/raise quarter,\" said Evercore's Mark Lipacis, an analyst ranked among the top 1% on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Lipacis thinks the stock will outperform eventually as investors gain clarity on two key concerns. The first is whether CapEx growth can continue beyond 2027. In short, Lipacis thinks it can. While many liken today's AI spending to the Internet bubble of 2000, Lipacis points out two crucial distinctions: first, the Internet was a medium \"looking for an app,\" whereas AI is the application in search of compute cycles; second, internet infrastructure spending happened before returns were realized, while AI investment is being funded by actual returns. For instance, AI spending has driven a 35%-90% rise in revenue per employee over the past three years at hyperscalers, reducing costs in both software and headcount. The analyst believes AI-driven savings on $60 trillion in global OpEx are already financing current AI investments. In other words, AI CapEx isn't entirely new spending – it's largely a reallocation, shifting money from enterprise OpEx to the CapEx of hyperscalers, neoclouds, model developers, and enterprises. With current hyperscale CapEx at $1 trillion, less than 2% of global OpEx, Lipacis thinks there is \"more to go.\"</p>\n<p>The second concern is whether demand for AI tokens can sustain its \"parabolic growth.\" Here, too, Lipacis believes it can. Agentic AI represents a \"change in the paradigm\" for compute demand. In prior computing eras, such as PCs or smartphones, demand was constrained by the number of people – 8 billion people can only purchase so many devices. With Agentic AI, multiple autonomous agents can operate simultaneously on behalf of individuals or businesses, interacting with other agents in parallel. This creates virtually unlimited demand for AI tokens. \"Agentic AI has only just started, we expect parabolic growth demand for tokens will continue,\" the 5-star analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Lipacis maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, alongside his Street-high price target of $352, implying the stock will gain 90% in the year ahead. (To watch Lipacis' track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-lipacis\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NVDA stock's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 36 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. At $272.65, the average target offers 12-month upside of 47%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast</a>)</p>",
