Separately, KeyBanc's five-star-rated <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-patterson\">Justin Patterson</a> reduced his target from $905 to $875, and other firms, including Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor Fitzgerald, followed with similar moves while mostly maintaining their Buy ratings. This shows that there is less confidence in Meta's near-term upside. </p>\n<p>However, a few remained optimistic. In fact, five-star Wedbush analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/scott-devitt\">Scott Devitt</a> kept his price target at $920 despite the cost concerns. Additionally, Zuckerberg tried to ease fears by noting that Meta's AI-powered ad tools are now generating $60 billion annually. He said that even if the company builds too much computing capacity now, it will likely need it later for internal tools or third-party services. Nonetheless, Meta's $4 billion quarterly loss from Reality Labs didn't help the narrative. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 39 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $857.91 per share implies 28.8% upside potential.</p>",

That's raised concerns about whether such large capital expenditures will pay off.</p>\n<p>META stock fell by 11% after the company raised its 2025 capex guidance to $70 billion from $66 billion. Microsoft said its 2026 capex would exceed its 2025 level, and Alphabet lifted its 2025 capex range to $91-$93 billion from $75-$85 billion. The sharp rise in spending and unclear payoff prospects have fueled worries about a renewed wave of tech exuberance.</p>\n<p>The spending woes overshadowed a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dow-jones-shrugs-off-trumps-truly-great-meeting-with-chinese-president-xi\">one-year trade truce reached between the U.S. and China</a> following a meeting between President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Under the agreement, the U.S. will cut its fentanyl <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall tariff rate to 47% from 57%. In return, China agreed to boost U.S. soybean <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> and lift restrictions on rare earth exports. Trump said he expects the deal to be renegotiated once it expires and confirmed plans to visit China in April 2026, with Xi set to make a U.S. visit \"sometime after that.\"</p>\n<p>\"I had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. \"There is enormous respect between our two Countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place.\"</p>\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-orders-nuclear-weapons-testing-to-counter-china-russia\">Trump ordered the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing</a> as a response to match developments by Russia and China, saying the U.S. must test \"on an equal basis.\" The order could break a voluntary nuclear testing moratorium in place since 1992, although the form and scope of the testing remain unclear.</p>\n<p>Finally, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution blocking the national emergency measure that enabled Trump to impose sweeping global tariffs in a 51-47 vote with four Republicans joining Democrats. Despite the vote, the resolution is expected to be symbolic because the House of Representatives and the White House are unlikely to pass it. Earlier this week, the Senate approved similar resolutions to block Trump's tariffs on Brazil and Canada, with a number of Republicans crossing party lines as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">S&amp;P 500</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">SPX</a>) closed with a 0.99% loss, while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">Nasdaq 100</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">NDX</a>) fell by 1.47%.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute </strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic\"><strong>Economic Calendar</strong></a><strong> — filter by impact, country, and more.</strong></p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, confirmed this on Thursday during an interview with <em>Fox Business Network</em>. Bessent noted that the agreement was finalized in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. </p>\n<p>It comes after U.S. President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Donald Trump</a> and China's President Xi Jinping met on Thursday in Busan, South Korea, where they also agreed to new trade terms, particularly regarding tariffs. However, the government official noted that he expects the resolution on the deal to be reached over the coming weeks and months. </p>\n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Bessent, during an interview on <em>CBS News</em>, said \"all the details\" on the deal were \"ironed out\" in Madrid, Spain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TikTok Transfer Deal Presses On</strong></h2>\n<p>The development comes over a month after <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/president-trump-set-to-sign-tiktok-deal-on-thursday\">signed an executive order </a>declaring the TikTok sale ready, with a new joint venture to run the business valued at $14 billion. </p>\n<p>Trump's executive order outlined a sale structure to meet the national security requirements of the bipartisan 2024 law, which mandated that ByteDance divest its U.S. TikTok operations. Under the law, TikTok faced a nationwide ban in January 2025 due to its failure to complete the sale.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the latest update follows months of uncertainty over the transfer process. Last month, Trump <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-extends-tiktok-ban-again-as-u-s-china-near-deal\">issued his fourth delay of the ban on</a> the platform, pushing it back by another 90 days to December 16. This is even as the U.S. leader, days later, said <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/president-trump-confirms-progress-on-tiktok-deal-after-call-with-chinas-xi\">the country \"made progress\"</a> on the deal after a phone call with Xi. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TikTok to Get New Control Structure in U.S.</strong></h2>\n<p>According to reports, ByteDance will have less than 20% control in the new joint-venture company, with the rest going to a consortium of American investors, including software giant Oracle <a data-ticker=\"ORCL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/orcl\">(ORCL)</a> and private equity firms Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake. The new company is to be overseen by a U.S.-dominated board, with one member appointed by the Trump administration. </p>\n<p>Oracle has been confirmed as an investor <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/oracle-stock-orcl-soars-as-it-gets-set-to-take-control-of-crucial-tiktok-algorithm\">to take control of the platform's U.S. user data</a> and recommendation algorithm. Yet questions remain about whether the algorithm for the American market will differ from those used in other regions. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Best Social Media Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>As the transfer process continues, investors are watching the social media space for opportunities. Using <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/social-media\">TipRanks' Stock Comparison tool</a>, the chart below shows that Meta Platforms <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> and Pinterest <a data-ticker=\"PINS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pins\">(PINS)</a> currently offer the highest upside potential.</p>",

The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis Nov. 17. Netflix shares added more than 2% in after-hours trading on news of the stock split. Shares currently trade at $1,125, having gained more than 40% this year.</p>\n<p>Netflix is currently one of only 10 stocks in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index that has a price above $1,000. After the split, the stock would trade at $112.50 based on the current share price. In a news release, Netflix said the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/stock-splits/upcoming\">stock split</a> is being executed to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the stock option program.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Previous Splits</strong></h2>\n<p>Netflix has split its stock twice before, in 2004 and again in 2015. A split simply gives each holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change. The company's fundamentals also remain the same. However, a lower share price makes the stock more accessible to investors. </p>\n<p>The stock split comes after Netflix reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/weekend-updates/netflixs-stock-tumbles-amid-earnings-miss-and-strategic-shifts\">disappointing third-quarter financial results</a>. Earlier in October, the company announced earnings per share (EPS) of $5.87, which was well below the $6.97 expected among analysts. Revenue of $11.51 billion matched the consensus expectation on Wall Street. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is NFLX Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Netflix has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 31 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 24 Buy, six Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx/forecast\">average NFLX price target </a>of $1,402.19 implies 28.76% upside from current levels. </p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Ives said Palantir has a \"golden path\" ahead and could become the next Oracle <a data-ticker=\"ORCL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/orcl\">(ORCL)</a> over the coming years. He noted that Palantir is improving its products, adding top talent, and expanding worldwide, strengthening its position as a major player in the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> space.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Highlights Growing AIP Demand</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives said Palantir remains \"at the forefront of the AI race\" as more companies and government agencies adopt its AIP tools. He noted that demand is strong because the platform helps users apply AI to make quicker and better decisions.</p>\n<p>Based on Wedbush's research, Ives said AIP is helping Palantir win new clients and expand deals with current ones. He believes Wall Street's forecasts for Q3 are too low and that Palantir could beat expectations as its commercial business keeps growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Partnerships Strengthen Palantir's AI Reach</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives pointed to Palantir's new partnerships as key growth drivers. The company's deal with Snowflake <a data-ticker=\"SNOW\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/snow\">(SNOW)</a> connects Snowflake's AI Data Cloud with Palantir's Foundry and AIP platforms, allowing customers to build AI models faster and more securely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-nvda-strengthens-ai-leadership-through-new-deals-with-uber-and-palantir-pltr\">Palantir also announced a new partnership with Nvidia</a> <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> to bring Nvidia's Blackwell architecture into its AIP system. This will help improve AI performance for both enterprise and government clients using Palantir's software.</p>\n<p>Ives said these alliances put Palantir in a strong position to win more enterprise AI deals. He expects U.S. commercial revenue to grow more than 85% in fiscal 2025, supported by steady AIP adoption and rising demand across industries.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Government Deals Boost PLTR's Federal Strength</strong></h2>\n<p>Ives has also underlined Palantir's ongoing strength in government contracts. The company recently expanded its work with the UK Armed Forces <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/palantir-and-hadean-announce-partnership-thefly\">through a partnership with Hadean</a>, using Foundry for advanced defense simulations. It also secured a $385 million contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and a new defense deal in Poland.</p>\n<p>To conclude, Ives believes Palantir could eventually become a trillion-dollar company, with AIP serving as the core of its future growth story in the global AI market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PLTR a Good Stock to Buy Now?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street is sidelined on PLTR stock, with a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, 13 Holds, and two Sell recommendations. The average&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pltr/forecast\">PLTR stock price target</a>&nbsp;of $158.41 implies 20.32% downside risk from current levels.</p>",
