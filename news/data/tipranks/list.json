However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-earnings-coreweave-stock-drops-on-wider-than-expected-q4-loss\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-earnings-coreweave-stock-drops-on-wider-than-expected-q4-loss\">the company posted a much larger loss of $0.89 per share</a>, which overshadowed the strong top-line growth.</p>\n<p>The report showed no slowdown in customer demand. CoreWeave's contracted backlog rose to about $67 billion, supported by long-term deals with large technology companies building AI products.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Losses and Debt Became the Main Concern</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the strong growth, investors were worried about profitability.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave is expanding rapidly and building data centers across the U.S. To finance that build-out, the company has taken on large borrowings. Its debt and lease obligations have climbed to roughly $30 billion, and interest payments are taking a significant share of revenue.</p>\n<p>Because of those costs, losses widened instead of narrowing. But the market had expected the opposite. Investors expected larger scale to improve margins, but the earnings report suggested profits may still be far away.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guidance Triggered the Selloff</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock reaction was driven more by the outlook than by the reported quarter.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave guided first-quarter revenue to a range of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion, well below Wall Street expectations of about $2.29 billion. The company also projected an operating margin near 8%, signaling profitability remains limited in the near term.</p>\n<p>For full-year 2026, CoreWeave forecast revenue of $12 billion to $13 billion, roughly in line with estimates, but spending is set to rise sharply. The company plans $30 billion to $35 billion in capital expenditures in 2026 as it continues building data-center capacity.</p>\n<p>Together, the outlook showed growth will continue, but heavy spending and low margins suggest profits remain far away.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Investors Will Watch Next</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors will now watch whether losses begin to narrow. They will look at margins, interest expense, and how much the company continues to spend as new data centers come online and start generating revenue.</p>\n<p>CoreWeave is building capacity first and recognizing revenue later, so costs appear immediately while income ramps over time. The next few quarters should show whether that gap starts to close.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CoreWeave a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, CRWV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buy and eight Hold ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave stock price target of $118.57</a>&nbsp;implies 20.72% upside potential. &nbsp;It's worth noting that estimates will likely change following today's earnings report.</p>",

He has a lot to fix right now at Disney, and some are already starting to wonder if the job is too big for any one CEO. Investors are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, and sent Disney shares up fractionally in Thursday afternoon's trading.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>So what is going on for D'Amaro right now?

That does not even factor in what may happen if the regular consumer starts using it instead. Marvel is losing steam. The <em>Star Wars</em> franchise has not had a hit in quite a while, with even the upcoming trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> getting what can be charitably described as mixed reactions.</p>\n<p>This is not one big task; this is several big tasks that are all coming due all at once. But D'Amaro has one thing working for him, a thing some call \"the Josh Effect.\" D'Amaro has a gift for eye contact and making other people feel seen and heard. That is certainly no small gift, but will it be enough to turn doddering franchises into <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/disney-stock-dis-in-focus-as-company-names-new-ceo\">fan favorites</a> and money-makers once more?</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building Goodwill</strong></h2>\n<p>However, Disney might have a bit of goodwill building going on, as it teams up with the Indianapolis Children's Museum to deliver \"Tiana's Joyful Celebration,\" an event that starts in March and runs through to just after New Year's Day 2027.</p>\n<p>The event is built around a narrative of Tiana from The Princess and the Frog—Disney's first Black princess—preparing for a special event in New Orleans. Along the way, the children who go through the exhibit will engage in a slate of hands-on activities designed to \"help out\" with the event. This is actually the third time the museum has collaborated with Disney, following events with <em>Doc McStuffins</em> and the <em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em>. Since this event uses a theatrical release for its basis, it might be considered the biggest such event yet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Disney Stock a Buy or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on DIS stock based on 17 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 5.62% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dis\">loss in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dis/forecast\">average DIS price target</a> of $135.41 per share implies 28.3% upside potential.</p>",
