The firm said the company is seeking growth outside its burgers and sausages, as demand in that category remains soft.</p>\n<p>Industry data showed that volumes in the U.S. plant-based meat market fell about 7% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Beyond Meat's own product volumes dropped roughly 13%, even though the company raised prices by about 5%, indicating customers are sensitive to higher prices amid slowing demand.</p>\n<p>The firm added that the shift into nutrition drinks introduces execution risk, since the beverage business relies on different marketing and distribution channels.</p>\n<p>Mizuho also pointed to Beyond Meat's earlier expansion into plant-based jerky in 2022, which failed to gain traction and highlighted how challenging new categories can be for the company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Investor Attention Turns to the March 11 Earnings Report</strong></h2>\n<p>With the company's Q4 2024 results due March 11, investors will be watching whether demand stabilizes and whether the company can slow its sales declines. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\">Wall Street expects sales to drop about 18% year over year</a>&nbsp;to around $63 million.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\">Analysts also see a loss of about $0.10 per share</a>, narrower than the $0.65 loss a year ago.</p>\n<p>Beyond Meat has yet to show that its core business can return to growth. Unless product volumes improve, analysts believe recent stock gains could be hard to sustain.</p>\n<p>For now, the rally reflects renewed trading interest, but Wall Street's cautious stance suggests the earnings report, rather than the drink launch, will likely determine the stock's next move.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Beyond Meat a Good Stock to Buy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/technical-analysis\">TipRanks' Technical Analysis Tool</a>&nbsp;to assess the outlook for BYND stock. The tool indicates a \"Neutral\" consensus, with eight indicators showing Bearish signals, four Neutral, and nine Bullish.</p>",

That was up from 117.1 miles per gallon in 2019.</p>\n<p>At the time, rules in place allowed automakers to get extra credit for every pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle they sold, which they could turn around and sell to other companies who were focused on gas-powered vehicles. Tesla managed to pull in $401 million worth of regulatory credits just in 2025, though there are signs the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-dives-despite-new-cybertruck-feature\">administration plans</a> to pull more of these credits going forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>This is What Elon Musk Actually Believes</strong></h2>\n<p>Even as Tesla continues to sell cars, and prepares to expand into robotics, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/teslas-megapack-will-power-400mw-ai-data-center-in-brazil\">artificial intelligence</a> (<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>), and beyond, CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a> has some very specific ideas about where humanity as a whole is going.

That's the future we're headed for,\" he noted back during a shareholder meeting last November. Given that, almost 10 years prior, Musk was calling for AI to ultimately wipe out the human race, it is sort of a heel-face turn. The exact mechanics of such a play, though, elude many, including business school professors who wonder who owns the capital in such an environment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy, Hold or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

With the deal drama removed, Netflix can return to its core growth formula, focus on pricing power, subscriber growth, and margin expansion, which Yoon says has fueled its long‑term success and should continue to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramount Skydance: </strong>Even if PSKY is paying a premium, Yoon argued that acquiring WBD is still a better strategic path than continuing a \"mediocre standalone trajectory.\" The deal gives PSKY a chance to reshape its future. Yoon does not expect the company to push the price much higher, but he sees strategic logic in the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Warner Bros. Discovery:</strong> WBD shareholders have already seen the stock more than double since PSKY first showed interest in September 2025. PSKY's $31‑per‑share all‑cash offer, backed by financing guarantees and a massive $7 billion termination fee, stands out as clearly superior to Netflix's bid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=WBD&amp;ticker=PSKY&amp;ticker=NFLX\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to line up all three companies in the takeover saga and see which stock analysts favor.

The companies said the new arrangement does not change their long-standing partnership. They added that \"nothing about today's announcements\" alters the previously shared terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has worked with OpenAI since 2019 and provides the Azure cloud systems used to train and operate many of its models. The statement said Microsoft keeps its exclusive license to OpenAI technology and that core services and developer access to the models continue to run on Azure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft Still the Main Partner?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Amazon news drew attention because Microsoft has been OpenAI's main infrastructure and product partner. OpenAI tools are built into Microsoft software and business services, and Azure hosts much of the computing behind the models.</p>\n<p>When OpenAI added another cloud provider, investors questioned whether Microsoft could lose that central role. The companies clarified that OpenAI is adding extra capacity to meet rising demand, not replacing Microsoft.</p>\n<p>They also said partnerships with other cloud providers were always allowed under their agreement and that Microsoft still shares revenue from those deals.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenAI may use more computing providers as usage grows, but Microsoft remains a key part of how the technology reaches customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare Amazon and Microsoft to see which one analysts favor.
