The drop wiped out more than $220 billion in market value and highlighted investor concern over rising expenses and slower short-term profits.</p>\n<p>Even so, Meta's financial health remains solid. The company has strong cash reserves and steady cash flow, giving it room to fund big projects without hurting daily operations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Next for Meta</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's $30 billion bond sale shows it is all-in on AI, even as costs mount. While some investors are uneasy, analysts like Crockett see it as a smart long-term bet.
