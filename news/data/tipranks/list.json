Segment-wise, Oncology revenue grew 31% to $184.4 million, driven by a 40% increase in test volume, while Shield screening revenue came in at $24.1 million, reflecting growing demand for early cancer detection.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the company achieved positive <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gh/financials/cash-flow\">free cash flow</a> in its core business one quarter ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>Coming to the bottom line, the company reported a net loss of $0.74 per share compared with analysts' expectations of a loss of $0.79.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guidance Raise Fuels Optimism</strong></h2>\n<p>Guardant Health lifted its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $965 million to $970 million, up from the prior range of $915 million to $925 million.

Because each state, and sometimes each city, has different rules for <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/teslas-vehicle-safety-report-shows-that-its-autopilot-tech-significantly-reduces-accidents\">self-driving cars</a>, Tesla has to deal with a wide range of regulations just to expand.</p>\n<p>As a result, Tesla's robotaxis still rely on human drivers, though Musk says they might remove them soon in parts of Austin. Moreover, the company is hiring for robotaxi-related roles in Florida and other cities, such as Denver and New York, even though some of these places still don't allow fully autonomous cars. Nevertheless, Tesla plans to eventually switch from using modified Model Ys to a new driverless vehicle called the Cybercab, which Musk says will go into production in 2026.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Prediction for Tesla Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on Tesla stock based on 14 Buys, 11 Holds, and 10 Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.&nbsp;Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">average Tesla price target</a>&nbsp;of $382.54 per share implies 13.2% downside risk.</p>",
