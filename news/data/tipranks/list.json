            "title": "'Still a Buy,' Says Top Analyst on Strategy Stock (MSTR) After Q3, Despite Price Target Cut",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Harte said that during the Q3 2025 earnings call, Saylor described how Strategy is building what he called a \"credit factory,\" a set of products that let investors choose different levels of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> exposure. The company now has four preferred equity offerings, each giving investors a different balance of risk and return. Harte said this approach effectively builds a Bitcoin yield curve, letting investors pick how much exposure they want.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q3 Earnings Snapshot</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The company posted <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/mstr-earnings-strategys-financial-results-beat-on-top-and-bottom-lines\">better-than-expected Q3 results</a>, driven by strong gains from its Bitcoin holdings and higher revenue from its core business. It reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $8.42 per share</a>, beating estimates of $7.90, on revenue of $128.7 million, which topped forecasts of $116.35 million. Notably, the company now owns about 640,808 BTC, valued at roughly $70.9 billion at current prices, with an average purchase cost of $74,032 per coin.</p>\n<p>During the quarter, Strategy Inc. also increased its dividend rate to 10.5% for its Series A Preferred Stock to attract more investor demand. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor called this an \"inflection point\" for the company, as it continues to expand funding options tied to its growing Bitcoin strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Highlights Growth Potential</strong></h2>\n<p>The analyst noted that Strategy is widening its reach by developing new credit products and introducing international securities. The company's recent B- credit rating from S&amp;P Global will let it tap into the high-yield market, giving it more ways to raise capital beyond equity sales.</p>\n<p>Despite the stock being down 37% year to date, Harte said Strategy's valuation looks attractive, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/statistics\">trading at about 1.3 times its modified net asset value</a>, well below its long-term average of 2.1 times. He said this gives investors a good entry point into one of the purest public Bitcoin plays.</p>\n<p>Harte believes that while Bitcoin's price swings may keep short-term pressure on the stock, Strategy's growing funding options and product lineup make it better positioned for the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR Stock a&nbsp;Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr\">MSTR stock</a>&nbsp;has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buys and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\">average MSTR price target&nbsp;</a>of $532.84 implies a 109.31% upside from current levels.</p>",

Revenue from this segment climbed 15% year-over-year, elevated by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The California-based company also saw its earnings per share rise 13% YoY to $1.85, beating Wall Street's projected $1.78. Overall revenue slightly surpassed analysts' expectations of $102.17 billion, coming in at $102.5 billion. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here's Why Wall Street Is Turning Bullish on Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings beat, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee\">JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee</a> raised his AAPL price target by more than 12% to $305 per share, up from $290. </p>\n<p>The five-star analyst, who maintained his Overweight rating on the stock, noted that iPhone sales traction has helped Apple polish its outlook for the new fiscal year better than expected. Goldman Sachs also <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-aapl-goldman-sachs-boosts-price-targets-on-these-2-magnificent-7-stocks-after-solid-earnings-beat\">echoed a similar sentiment</a>.</p>\n<p>Following its Q4 performance, Apple now expects to rake in 10% to 12% more in revenue by the second quarter of its Fiscal Year 2026 — that is, between January and March next year. Chatterjee noted that this will be the company's highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. </p>\n<p>Subsequently, JPMorgan \"materially\" lifted its revenue growth forecast for Apple, believing it will continue to sustain its product cycle momentum. </p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wamsi-mohan\">Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan</a> raised his price target from $320 to $325, noting that Apple surprised Wall Street's projections with its 47.2% gross profit margin, even after a $1.1 billion charge from tariffs during the quarter. </p>\n<p>Mohan believes the company will post even better margins in Q2, riding on expected easing of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> conditions and a shift in revenue composition, with a greater proportion emerging from its&nbsp;Services&nbsp;segment. The five-star analyst further pointed to the anticipated introduction of AI-enhanced Siri and the launch of a foldable iPhone smart device by September.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Will Apple Stock Reach $700 Again?</strong></h2>\n<p>Across the broader Wall Street, however, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">Apple's shares</a> currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, 12 Holds, and three Sells assigned by 35 analysts over the past three months. </p>\n<p>Moreover, at $266.24, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">the AAPL price target</a> suggests about 2% downside risk.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>During the first quarter, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> initiated a 20% <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China, citing the country's involvement in exporting the drug. As part of a trade truce reached earlier this week, he agreed to halve the tariff to 10%. Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady. Schmid warned that even a 25 bps rate cut wouldn't meaningfully affect labor market conditions but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/are-stocks-overbought-naaim-exposure-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-july-2024\">National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index</a>, which measures the exposure active investment managers have to U.S. stocks, climbed above 100 for the first time since July 2024.

He also pointed to Apple's plans for new designs, such as a potential foldable iPhone in 2026, and ongoing investment across its product line.</p>\n<p>On the services side, revenue rose 15% year over year, lifted by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.

Moskowitz expects more details on CRWV's financing and power plans when it reports third-quarter earnings on November 10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>M&amp;A Activity and Continued Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>After the merger fell apart, CoreWeave stated that it is staying focused on disciplined execution and building long-term shareholder value, including through selective and strategic acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company also announced the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-steps-out-with-marimo-acquisition-amid-failed-merger-bid\">acquisition of Marimo</a>, which develops an AI-based, interactive development environment for Python designed for AI and data tasks. This is one of several recent smaller acquisitions, and the company is expected to keep pursuing more deals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CoreWeave a Strong Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain divided on CoreWeave's long-term outlook. On TipRanks, CRWV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave price target of $156.87</a>&nbsp;implies 19.7% upside potential from current levels. Since its public listing on March 31, 2025, CRWV stock has surged nearly 253%.</p>",

However, on Thursday, NVDA shares fell more than 2% after the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/us-president-trump-china-president-xi-meeting-10232\">Trump–Xi summit</a> failed to deliver any updates on chip sales, dampening investor sentiment. Year-to-date, Nvidia stock remains up over 50%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia Bets Big on Poolside</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg News</em>, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/nvidia-to-invest-as-much-as-1b-in-ai-startup-poolside-bloomberg-reports-thefly\">Nvidia's planned investment of up to $1 billion in Poolside</a> could quadruple the startup's valuation, making it one of the largest recent bets in the AI space. For context, Poolside is a French AI company that develops powerful AI models to automate and enhance coding processes, helping users write and optimize software more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Poolside is reportedly in talks to raise $2 billion at a pre-money valuation of $12 billion. Nvidia's contribution is expected to begin at around $500 million and could rise to $1 billion if the startup reaches its fundraising goals. The reports further stated that Poolside has already secured over $1 billion in commitments, including about $700 million from existing investors.</p>\n<p>Nvidia earlier backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024. Both Poolside and Nvidia declined to comment on the recent reports.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Nvidia's Poolside Move Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia, which is already a major investor in AI startups, continues to diversify its portfolio across multiple sectors. The company's Poolside investment highlights how the world's most valuable company is helping build a growing network of AI startups that could also become key customers. One source said Poolside plans to use part of the new funding to buy Nvidia's GB300 chips.</p>\n<p>For Poolside, the deal supports its ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, the startup announced a partnership with CoreWeave <a data-ticker=\"CRWV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv\">(CRWV)</a> to build <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-teams-up-with-nvidia-backed-poolside-to-build-massive-data-center\">one of the largest data centers in the U.S.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Looking ahead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">NVDA stock</a>&nbsp;has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on&nbsp;36 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months.
