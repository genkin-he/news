The companies said the new arrangement does not change their long-standing partnership. They added that \"nothing about today's announcements\" alters the previously shared terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has worked with OpenAI since 2019 and provides the Azure cloud systems used to train and operate many of its models. The statement said Microsoft keeps its exclusive license to OpenAI technology and that core services and developer access to the models continue to run on Azure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft Still the Main Partner?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Amazon news drew attention because Microsoft has been OpenAI's main infrastructure and product partner. OpenAI tools are built into Microsoft software and business services, and Azure hosts much of the computing behind the models.</p>\n<p>When OpenAI added another cloud provider, investors questioned whether Microsoft could lose that central role. The companies clarified that OpenAI is adding extra capacity to meet rising demand, not replacing Microsoft.</p>\n<p>They also said partnerships with other cloud providers were always allowed under their agreement and that Microsoft still shares revenue from those deals.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenAI may use more computing providers as usage grows, but Microsoft remains a key part of how the technology reaches customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare Amazon and Microsoft to see which one analysts favor.

This also marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase. On a year-over-year basis, PPI climbed 2.9%, topping expectations of 2.6%. The index is closely watched by investors because several of its components flow into the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/pce-price-index-yoy-60\">Personal Consumption Expenditures</a> (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/core-ppi-yoy-144\">Core PPI</a>, which excludes food and energy items, grew 0.8% in January and increased 3.6% from the prior year, marking the fastest annual pace since March 2025. Both figures exceeded estimates of 0.3% and 3.0%, respectively.</p>\n<p>The rise in PPI was fueled by a 0.8% monthly increase in services prices, the largest since July 2025, while goods prices fell 0.3%. More than 20% of the services gain came from a 14.4% surge in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesalers.</p>\n<p>\"Retailers'&nbsp;<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a>&nbsp;bill has come down marginally in the last few months, but they have continued to lift their selling prices,\" wrote Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief U.S. Economist Samuel Tombs in a note to clients.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/tech\">tech sector continues to face weakness</a> as concerns about the impact of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spread across the industry.

However, demand is now moving toward running those models in everyday applications. As businesses deploy AI tools for coding, search, and customer service, they need chips that can deliver quick answers while using less power.</p>\n<p>The planned processor is intended to handle those requests more efficiently. Reports indicate OpenAI could become one of the major customers, using the system to improve the speed of its tools.</p>\n<p>The company hinted at this earlier when it said it would purchase \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia as part of a broader agreement. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazons-50b-openai-bet-hinges-on-key-conditions-what-investors-should-know\">OpenAI also signed a separate deal to use Amazon</a> <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> Trainium chips, showing customers are exploring multiple suppliers for AI computing needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia's New Chip Comes amid Rising Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>The new processor also comes as competition in AI hardware rises. Several large tech companies are building alternatives so they do not depend as much on Nvidia's systems. Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-eyes-in-house-chips-to-cut-ai-costs-a-challenge-to-nvidia-nvda\">Amazon have launched their own AI chips</a>, while smaller startups are creating processors made mainly for inference tasks.</p>\n<p>Nvidia still holds a large share of the AI chip market, but the move toward real-time AI services is pushing the company to broaden its product lineup. By launching a chip built for inference, Nvidia is trying to keep its lead as AI shifts from building models to actually running them in apps and services.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Price Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy Consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">average Nvidia price target of $273.38</a>&nbsp;implies 54.29% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA shares have surged nearly 42%.</p>",

Which means that the Department of Defense will likely not find much support for convincing Anthropic to change its rules. However, the Department of Defense might ultimately classify Anthropic as a \"supply-chain risk,\" or may turn to other laws in place to force Anthropic's hand. Anthropic may have little choice here, especially given that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/xai\">xAI</a> recently allowed the Pentagon to turn to Grok for some of its classified systems needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deliveries are On Track</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, good news came out of Virgin Airlines, which revealed that Boeing's deliveries were \"on track\" to meet targets. With Virgin on track to carry out <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/boeing-stock-nyseba-slips-despite-african-gains\">fleet modernization</a> efforts, that means modern Boeing aircraft need to arrive, and on schedule.</p>\n<p>Boeing is expected to deliver 13 737-8 aircraft over the 2026 fiscal year, reports note, and will land some 737-10 models as well. Nearly half the 737-8s are expected to arrive in the first half of the year, and Boeing is apparently right on track to deliver. Virgin reportedly wants the 737-8 aircraft to take over for the 737-800 NG models, as the 737-8s are more fuel-efficient.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Boeing a Good Stock to Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on BA stock based on 13 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 31.37% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ba/forecast\">average BA price target</a> of $278.17 per share implies 23.5% upside potential.</p>",

The firm said the company is seeking growth outside its burgers and sausages, as demand in that category remains soft.</p>\n<p>Industry data showed that volumes in the U.S. plant-based meat market fell about 7% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Beyond Meat's own product volumes dropped roughly 13%, even though the company raised prices by about 5%, indicating customers are sensitive to higher prices amid slowing demand.</p>\n<p>The firm added that the shift into nutrition drinks introduces execution risk, since the beverage business relies on different marketing and distribution channels.</p>\n<p>Mizuho also pointed to Beyond Meat's earlier expansion into plant-based jerky in 2022, which failed to gain traction and highlighted how challenging new categories can be for the company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Investor Attention Turns to the March 11 Earnings Report</strong></h2>\n<p>With the company's Q4 2024 results due March 11, investors will be watching whether demand stabilizes and whether the company can slow its sales declines. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\">Wall Street expects sales to drop about 18% year over year</a>&nbsp;to around $63 million.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\">Analysts also see a loss of about $0.10 per share</a>, narrower than the $0.65 loss a year ago.</p>\n<p>Beyond Meat has yet to show that its core business can return to growth. Unless product volumes improve, analysts believe recent stock gains could be hard to sustain.</p>\n<p>For now, the rally reflects renewed trading interest, but Wall Street's cautious stance suggests the earnings report, rather than the drink launch, will likely determine the stock's next move.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Beyond Meat a Good Stock to Buy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/technical-analysis\">TipRanks' Technical Analysis Tool</a>&nbsp;to assess the outlook for BYND stock. The tool indicates a \"Neutral\" consensus, with eight indicators showing Bearish signals, four Neutral, and nine Bullish.</p>",

That was up from 117.1 miles per gallon in 2019.</p>\n<p>At the time, rules in place allowed automakers to get extra credit for every pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle they sold, which they could turn around and sell to other companies who were focused on gas-powered vehicles.
