The company also stated that YouTube TV is using its growing power in the market to demand tougher terms during negotiations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, YouTube TV argued that Disney's proposed terms would drive up prices for consumers and unfairly benefit Disney's own live TV platforms, including Hulu + Live TV.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>YouTube TV Stands Its Ground</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>YouTube TV is among the biggest pay-TV services in the U.S. This year, it has been busy securing new content deals with major media companies.

Core Scientific operates data centers for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrency</a> mining.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strategic Impact from the Rejection</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz noted that both companies will continue operating independently and CoreWeave's commercial partnership with Core Scientific will remain intact. He believes that the leasing deal with Core Scientific remains an important part of CoreWeave's AI journey.</p>\n<p>He highlighted that CoreWeave and Core Scientific have close ties with over $10 billion in future lease commitments and about 840 megawatts (MW) of contracted capacity. CoreWeave had aimed to save $500 million annually by 2027 through the merger, mainly by consolidating lease costs, but these savings are now off the table.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CoreWeave Can Capture Meaningful Share Alone</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz sees <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/top-analyst-sees-5-billion-boost-to-coreweaves-crwv-backlog-from-new-ai-deal\">CoreWeave as capturing a meaningful share of the AI cloud</a> provider market, although he had downgraded CRWV to a Hold rating in July due to the \"outsized returns\" since its IPO.</p>\n<p>While the merger rejection closed off opportunities to lower its cost of capital and access infrastructure-focused financing, CoreWeave remains committed to executing on its growth strategy. Moskowitz expects more details on CRWV's financing and power plans when it reports third-quarter earnings on November 10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>M&amp;A Activity and Continued Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>After the merger fell apart, CoreWeave stated that it is staying focused on disciplined execution and building long-term shareholder value, including through selective and strategic acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company also announced the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-steps-out-with-marimo-acquisition-amid-failed-merger-bid\">acquisition of Marimo</a>, which develops an AI-based, interactive development environment for Python designed for AI and data tasks.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave price target of $156.87</a>&nbsp;implies 19.7% upside potential from current levels.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The bond plan came a day after Zuckerberg told investors that <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spending will climb sharply next year, with capital costs in 2026 expected to be \"notably higher\" than in 2025. Meta aims to use these funds to boost its AI-driven ads, content tools, and recommendations across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Sees Big Upside in Meta's AI Push</strong></h2>\n<p>Some investors remain cautious about Meta's high spending, but <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\">Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett</a> believes the company is on the right track. Crockett, who recently set a Street-high price target of $1,117 for the stock, said Meta's heavy AI investment could bring faster revenue growth and stronger user engagement.</p>\n<p>He praised Meta's Q3 results as \"great\" and said the company's focus on AI positions it ahead of other tech players in digital advertising.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meta Shares Slide but Finances Stay Strong</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the optimism, Meta shares fell 13% on Thursday to $650.25 after <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-stock-falls-8-despite-strong-financial-results\">the company reported a $16 billion one-time tax charge in its quarterly results</a>. The drop wiped out more than $220 billion in market value and highlighted investor concern over rising expenses and slower short-term profits.</p>\n<p>Even so, Meta's financial health remains solid. The company has strong cash reserves and steady cash flow, giving it room to fund big projects without hurting daily operations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Next for Meta</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's $30 billion bond sale shows it is all-in on AI, even as costs mount. While some investors are uneasy, analysts like Crockett see it as a smart long-term bet. The key question now is whether this record fundraising will help Meta turn its massive AI spending into faster growth — or if these rising bills will test Wall Street's patience once again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 33 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $847.26 per share implies 27.13% upside potential.</p>",

In a post on X, he wrote that \"Apple bears owe us an explanation,\" for punishing the stock. He added that bears were wrong about Apple's lead times, store demand, and estimates.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>iPhone and Services Power Q4 Strength</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple attributed its stellar results to strong demand for the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-sees-strongest-iphone-growth-since-the-pandemic\">iPhone 17 lineup</a> and continued growth in its high-margin Services business. iPhone sales grew 6.1% year-over-year to $49 billion, while Services revenue surged 15.1%. The quarter included only two weeks of iPhone 17 sales, but early demand was strong, with reports showing it outsold the iPhone 16 by more than 14% in the first 10 days.</p>\n<p>Additionally, CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/timothy-cook\">Tim Cook</a> said that Apple expects strong holiday period sales, forecasting double-digit growth in iPhone sales and a return to growth in China.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cramer Dismisses Tech Sector Downturn</strong></h2>\n<p>Cramer also weighed in on the broader tech sector's recent decline following Meta Platforms' <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> announcement of <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-meta-msft-big-tech-fuels-ai-boom-with-aggressive-capital-spending\">higher capital expenditures on artificial intelligence</a> (AI).

Microsoft said its 2026 capex would exceed its 2025 level, and Alphabet lifted its 2025 capex range to $91-$93 billion from $75-$85 billion.

Earlier this week, the Senate approved similar resolutions to block Trump's tariffs on Brazil and Canada, with a number of Republicans crossing party lines as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">S&amp;P 500</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">SPX</a>) closed with a 0.99% loss, while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">Nasdaq 100</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">NDX</a>) fell by 1.47%.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute </strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic\"><strong>Economic Calendar</strong></a><strong> — filter by impact, country, and more.</strong></p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Highlights Sales Growth but Sees Little Near-Term Upside</strong></h2>\n<p>Hou said NIO plans to launch two more models, the L80 and ES9, along with an updated ES7 in 2026. These new models should help keep sales momentum strong if they perform as well as the company's recent launches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio/financials\">She increased her 2026–2030 sales forecast by 6%–11%</a>, expecting higher demand and better margins as NIO's production scale improves. Hou now sees gross margins 2%–3% higher than before and expects NIO to reach break-even by 2028, a year earlier than her previous estimate.</p>\n<p>Goldman also raised its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio/financials/cash-flow\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio/financials/cash-flow\">free cash flow forecast for 2026–2030 to RMB 22 billion</a>, up from RMB 11 billion earlier.</p>\n<p>While Hou expects higher sales and stronger cash flow in the coming years, she kept a Neutral rating, noting that the stock has limited upside in the short term.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is NIO a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio\">NIO stock</a>&nbsp;based on seven Buys, five Holds, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. The average&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nio/forecast\">NIO stock price target</a>&nbsp;of $6.72 implies 5.88% upside potential from current levels.</p>",

            "title": "Unexpected Change of Plans: Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) May Keep Zaslav",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>There is a new offer on the table for Warner from Paramount Skydance: $58 billion in cash and stock. And, should he decide to stay, David Zaslav would take over the top slot of the combined operation. This is likely welcome news for Zaslav, who has been eager to prove that he could turn Warner around after three years of hard times and cost cutting.</p>\n<p>The board, meanwhile, is backing Zaslav, as all offers from Paramount so far have been passed over, and plans to split the company into two parts—Warner Bros., for the studio and streaming arms, and Discovery Global for the linear television components. But the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-smoking-gunn-the-risk-warner-bros-discoverys-nasdaqwbd-sale-does-not-talk-much-about\">sheer amount of content</a> Warner controls, along with the studio and distribution arms, makes it a highly valuable prize for virtually any media operation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Paramount's Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>Reports also emerged about what Paramount has in mind for Warner, should it take over. Interestingly, reports note, Paramount wants to keep \"…most of Warner Bros. Discovery intact if an acquisition happens.\" This is something of a surprise, as it is likely to make an acquisition much tougher to get past regulators. The plans even include the possibility of having CNN share resources with CBS News.</p>\n<p>That makes for a much more dangerous proposition as far as regulation will go. The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration famously took Paramount to task back when it was merely Paramount over its handling of news. The idea that Paramount would be allowed to buy another news organization, particularly one the size of CNN, is staggering. It also seems like the kind of thing several regulatory groups would land on with both feet. Already, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/writers-guild-calls-paramount-wbd-merger-a-disaster-pledges-to-oppose-deal\">Writers Guild of America</a> has announced plans to fight such a merger, should it go through.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is WBD Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on seven Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 162.48% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd/forecast\">average WBD price target</a> of $20.27 per share implies 6.76% downside risk.</p>",
