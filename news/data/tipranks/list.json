Separately, KeyBanc's five-star-rated <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-patterson\">Justin Patterson</a> reduced his target from $905 to $875, and other firms, including Goldman Sachs, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Cantor Fitzgerald, followed with similar moves while mostly maintaining their Buy ratings. This shows that there is less confidence in Meta's near-term upside. </p>\n<p>However, a few remained optimistic. In fact, five-star Wedbush analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/scott-devitt\">Scott Devitt</a> kept his price target at $920 despite the cost concerns. Additionally, Zuckerberg tried to ease fears by noting that Meta's AI-powered ad tools are now generating $60 billion annually. He said that even if the company builds too much computing capacity now, it will likely need it later for internal tools or third-party services. Nonetheless, Meta's $4 billion quarterly loss from Reality Labs didn't help the narrative. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Overall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 39 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
