            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Management at Eli Lilly says the pill called Orforglipron meets most of the criteria to qualify for the FDA's national priority voucher, an accelerated approval review of new medications. The company plans to submit its review package for <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-invests-1-2-billion-in-puerto-rico-manufacturing-plant\">the weight-loss pill</a> to the FDA by year's end and seek an expedited review.</p>\n<p>In June of this year, the FDA launched a new program under which its commissioner can award vouchers to national‑priority drugs, shortening review times to one or two months from about 10 to 12. Priority criteria include innovative medicines, addressing unmet health needs, and boosting domestic U.S. manufacturing. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Production Underway</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly is <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/lly-earnings-eli-lilly-stock-soars-thanks-to-massive-year-over-year-growth\">gearing up for a big launch</a> of Orforglipron in the second half of 2026. The Indianapolis-based drug maker is already manufacturing the weight-loss pill and storing it at company warehouses, ready to ship as soon as it receives the expected regulatory approval from the FDA.</p>\n<p>The weight-loss pill was shown to help patients lose 12% of their body weight in a late-stage clinical trial, and the company has spent billions of dollars on new U.S. plants and facilities to produce the medication. Orforglipron is expected to be a gamechanger for weight-loss drugs, which are currently taken by injection. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is LLY Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Eli Lilly has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 22 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 18 Buy and four Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\">average LLY price target&nbsp;</a>of $909.44 implies 5.40% upside from current levels.</p>",

In fact, the $91 billion spent on stock buybacks in its most recent fiscal year was a deceleration from the $106 billion spent the previous year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hotly Debated</strong></h2>\n<p>Stock buybacks remain a hotly debated subject among investors. Critics claim that share repurchases artificially boost a company's stock, and that the money would be better spent reinvested in the company or providing dividend payments to shareholders. </p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apples-aapl-iphone-air-is-available-for-pre-order-in-china-starting-oct-17\">fans of stock buybacks</a>, including famed investor Warren Buffett, say that there's nothing wrong with companies such as Apple repurchasing their shares. According to Buffett, who owns roughly 2% of Apple and is among the company's largest stockholders, share repurchases give investors a larger percentage ownership in a business without requiring them to spend more money.</p>\n<p>\"If a management wishes to further intensify our ownership by repurchasing shares, we applaud,\" Buffett has said in the past. However, critics would also like to see Apple invest more of its free cash flow, notably in AI.
