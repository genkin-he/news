Platforms such as Amazon Web Services <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> and Google Cloud <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> still dominate the market, but price volatility and capacity limits during peak demand periods have become recurring challenges. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-vs-nbis-which-ai-infrastructure-stock-will-outperform-in-2026\">surge in GPU demand from AI workloads</a> has only deepened that strain.</p>\n<p>Render addresses this gap by aggregating unused GPU capacity from a global network of node operators and matching it with buyers through a decentralized system. Instead of relying on centralized data centers, the protocol creates a marketplace where underutilized hardware can be activated on demand. Industry research suggests a meaningful share of installed GPU capacity worldwide sits idle for long periods, creating an opening for networks that can mobilize that excess supply efficiently.</p>\n<p>The timing favors this model. The global artificial intelligence market was valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 and is projected to approach the trillion dollar range before the end of the decade, according to Statista. Render has already processed workloads for visual effects studios, gaming firms, and machine learning teams. That blend of creative and technical users supports the case that the network is serving production grade use cases rather than experimental traffic.</p>\n<p>However, in line with other crypto prices in recent months, RNDR-USD has dropped 25% in the past three months. </p>",

However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci\">Super Micro stock has declined 34% in the past 12 months</a> as this initial interest waned.

I am also bullish on Super Micro as I believe the market is mispricing its growth potential at a forward P/E multiple of just 20.4x.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Super Micro's DLC Investments Will Accelerate Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the main reasons behind my bullish stance on Super Micro is how the company has transformed itself from an individual server deployer to focus on fully integrated AI factories with built-in liquid cooling infrastructure. These AI factories consist of Datacenter Building Block Solutions and Direct Liquid Cooling infrastructure. Super Micro is aggressively investing to expand its rack-scale capacity to cater to the growing demand for Direct Liquid Cooling racks. The goal is to reach a capacity of 6,000 racks per month by the end of FY 2026 (Fiscal year ending June 2026), out of which 3,000 would be DLC racks. The company's investments in its plants in Silicon Valley, Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Middle East are expected to help this production capacity growth.</p>\n<p>According to Dell'Oro Group, the data center DLC market is projected to grow exponentially to reach $63 billion by 2029 from just $1.1 billion in 2024. Within the next few years, DLC technology is expected to become the dominant heat technology in data centers amid growing rack density. Modern AI processors are now using 700 to 1,000 watts per chip, which has already pushed server rack densities beyond the 100kW threshold. This has given rise to an urgent need for liquid cooling systems. </p>\n<p>This is where Super Micro comes in with its unmatched DLC manufacturing scale. The company's aggressive investments highlighted earlier should help it emerge as the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/super-micro-vast-data-launch-new-enterprise-ai-data-platform-solution-thefly-news\">partner of choice</a> for hyperscalers. The company's recent contract wins with the likes of xAI, DataVolt, and CoreWeave, Inc. <a data-ticker=\"CRWV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv\">(CRWV)</a> highlight the early progress it has made.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The India Expansion is Timely</strong></h2>\n<p>My bullish stance on Super Micro is strengthened by the company's ambitious international expansion plans. The potential expansion to India, which was first reported by ANI last week, is the latest global expansion move by the company. According to Super Micro's EMEA Managing Director Vik Malyala, the company is evaluating its options to start manufacturing in India to serve the growing demand for servers in India. </p>\n<p>Although many investors focus on data center growth in the U.S., India has been firing on all cylinders as well. According to KPMG, data center capacity in India is expected to surpass 2GW by the end of this year, more than doubling year-over-year. By 2030, capacity is expected to exceed 8GW. This exponential growth in capacity is expected to come on the back of investments worth more than $30 billion.</p>\n<p>Super Micro, by expanding into India, will benefit in two ways. First, this move will help the company diversify its revenue sources, which is much needed given that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/financials\">~63% of its revenue</a> came from just one customer in the most recent quarter. One of the reasons behind Super Micro's cheap valuation is its reliance on a single customer to drive revenue growth. By expanding to India, Super Micro will be in a strong position to lure new multi-billion-dollar customers such as Reliance Industries <a data-ticker=\"IN:RELIANCE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/in:reliance\">(IN:RELIANCE)</a>, The Adani Group, and Tata Group, which have collectively pledged to invest more than $300 billion through 2030 in AI data centers. </p>\n<p>Second, an India expansion will help Super Micro make the most of the favorable regulatory environment in India. Policymakers in India have shown a strong tendency to support international tech giants expanding their manufacturing footprint in India through tax concessions and hassle-free financing solutions. Coupled with cheap access to high-quality labor, this favorable policy framework should boost Super Micro's operating margins in the long run.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Super Micro a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?</strong></h2>\n<p>Based on the ratings of 10 Wall Street analysts, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast\">average Super Micro price target</a> is $38.89, which implies upside of 27% from the current market price. Its analyst consensus rating is a Hold, with 2 Buy, 6 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings.</p>",
