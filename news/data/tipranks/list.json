The lower rates arrive just ahead of spring, a period that typically sees increased home-buying activity. \"With a sub-6% rate, we'll get reliable sales growth across the country,\" said Compass Chief Economist Mike Simonsen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Higher Costs May Limit Housing Demand</strong></h2>\n<p>Others aren't so sure that lower rates will lead to higher demand. Whelan Advisory CEO Margaret Whelan notes that consumer sentiment remains subdued alongside a labor market that has shown signs of weakening. In addition, both electricity and home insurance costs have risen, making it more expensive to own a home.</p>\n<p>Economists expect rates to stay in the high 5% to low 6% range for the remainder of the year. Fannie Mae (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fnma\">FNMA</a>) expects an average rate of 6%, while the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts a 6.1% rate.</p>",

The fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and was created in the 1990s to invest profits from Norway's oil and gas industry. Today, it owns stakes in more than 7,200 companies across 60 countries, equal to roughly 1.5% of all publicly traded stocks worldwide. </p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Interestingly, it now uses <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/anthropic\">Anthropic</a>'s <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools to scan <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/hacker-jailbreaks-claude-ai-to-steal-150gb-of-mexican-government-data\">large volumes of public information</a> and deliver governance and sustainability insights to portfolio managers. More specifically, these tools can flag potential risks within 24 hours of a new investment, such as links to forced labor, corruption, or fraud, even if major news outlets have not reported them yet. In some cases, the fund was able to sell investments before the broader market reacted, thereby helping it avoid losses. </p>\n<p>However, the fund's ethical decisions have also caused controversy. For example, last year it sold shares in companies such as Caterpillar <a data-ticker=\"CAT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cat\">(CAT)</a> and several Israeli banks, which drew criticism from U.S. officials who questioned the reasoning behind the move. Norway's finance minister insisted that the decision was not political, but the backlash led to temporary changes to how companies can be excluded while the ethical framework was reviewed. Nevertheless, NBIM claims that sustainability and governance risks are closely tied to long-term financial performance. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Claude Investors Have Seen Huge Gains</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/anthropic\">Anthropic investors have seen huge gains during the past few months</a>&nbsp;as the company's valuation has increased from $183 billion to $380 billion.

It is one of detractors' favorite pejoratives in describing the output of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>, though, so it is little surprise Nadella has been avoiding the term.

While Nadella was referring to AI assistants, agents, and augmenting human work, the potential user base sees it a bit more broadly than that. Still, for Nadella to actually use the word \"slop\" himself, after not so long ago insisting that we avoid that word, is something of a big step.</p>\n<p>Nadella found himself perched between the horns of a dilemma. Microsoft has put a lot into building AI, and will likely continue to do so for some time. But there is a growing backlash around it, as users find themselves wondering when this program will replace their own work outright. And for every example of time savings or cost savings Microsoft can bring up, it has to deal with reports of AI hallucinating, like West Midlands Police and its unexpected Copilot mishap featuring a football game that did not exist.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Still Trying</strong></h2>\n<p>But indeed, Microsoft will continue to stick to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ai-demand-is-real-nvidia-ceo-huang-signals-after-earnings-what-nvda-investors-should-know\">AI development</a>. In fact, Microsoft released a blog post about using AI in education. Microsoft's Allyson Knox, senior director of education and workforce police, testified before the House Education and Workforce Subcommittee about AI use in schools.</p>\n<p>Knox revealed that Microsoft is particularly interested in three key areas of AI in schools. First is AI literacy, the nuts and bolts of being able to handle AI in the first place. Second is guardrails, or how to use AI without simply using it to generate assignments. Finally, tools, or setting up offerings that are directly ready to be put in place in schools. And Microsoft has already been working in these veins for some time now, bringing out some concrete developments that Knox also shared with the subcommittee.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft a Buy, Hold or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MSFT stock based on 33 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 2.06% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">loss in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast\">average MSFT price target</a> of $594.02 per share implies 48.39% upside potential.</p>",

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Tech giant Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> may not immediately <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-50-billion-in-openai\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-in-talks-to-invest-50-billion-in-openai\">invest the full $50 billion it has been discussing</a> with <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/openai\"><strong>OpenAI</strong></a>. As reported by <em>The Information</em>, most of the funding would depend on whether OpenAI goes public or it reaches artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which refers to <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> systems that can handle many tasks at a level close to human reasoning.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Under the reported terms, Amazon would invest about $15 billion upfront, while the remaining $35 billion would be released if OpenAI either goes public or reaches the AGI milestone.</p>\n<p>The proposed investment is part of OpenAI's current funding round, which could exceed $100 billion and value the company at about $730 billion before financing. Other large investors are also preparing commitments. Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> and SoftBank <a data-ticker=\"SFTBY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sftby\">(SFTBY)</a> are each expected to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/softbank-to-invest-30b-more-in-openais-new-830b-funding-round\">invest roughly $30 billion in stages as part of the same round</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Amazon Set These Conditions</strong></h2>\n<p>The new structure shows that Amazon wants clear proof before committing most of its money. An IPO would give OpenAI a market value and tradable shares. Meanwhile, an AGI milestone would mean the company's systems can perform many tasks instead of only generating text, images, or code.</p>\n<p>The talks are also linked to a broader cloud deal between the companies. OpenAI is discussing expanding its earlier $38 billion cloud agreement with Amazon and may use Amazon's Trainium chips to train its AI models.</p>\n<p>Currently, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> has exclusive rights to host OpenAI's models on its Azure cloud platform. That exclusivity could change if OpenAI reaches AGI, which would allow the company to offer its models on other cloud providers, including Amazon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How the Agreement Could Help Amazon Compete with Rivals</strong></h2>\n<p>For Amazon, the deal is closely tied to its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services. Microsoft already benefits from its partnership with OpenAI through the Azure cloud platform. A stronger relationship with OpenAI could help Amazon draw more developers and business customers that are building AI tools and services.</p>\n<p>The payment structure also reduces risk. Amazon gains a position in the AI market now but commits most of its money only if OpenAI goes public or reaches the AGI milestone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 40 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">average AMZN price target</a>&nbsp;of $282.21 per share implies 33.98% upside potential.</p>",

Some love it. Some hate it. And some would rather the whole thing was never an issue to begin with. But it is here, and it even has a new feature some have been waiting for for a long time now: Active Noise Cancellation. This feature will be coming out soon, reports note, but that did little to help Tesla shares today. Shares dropped nearly 3% in Thursday afternoon's trading.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Tesla recently added Active Noise Cancellation to its feature list, This was a bit of a surprise as it turns out Cybertrucks have always had the necessary hardware to activate the feature, but it was simply never actually started. In fact, Tesla vehicles have been using noise cancellation since 2021, with the Model S and Model X.</p>\n<p>The Active Noise Cancellation system uses a combination of microphones and speakers to detect road noise and then generate a kind of \"anti-noise\" at a frequency appropriate to basically muffle the sound coming in. The result is a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/thats-not-investing-thats-speculation-tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-gains-despite-bearish-outlook-on-optimus\">quieter driving experience</a>, particularly for those in the front seats. Interestingly, the Model S and Model X had six microphones to do that job, but the Cybertruck only has four.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where Scrapped Cybertrucks Go</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, an unexpected wrinkle showed up, as Tesla revealed what happens to scrapped Cybertrucks. It turns out that the diner Tesla built out in Hollywood is actually built using \"…recycled stainless steel from <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-tsla-rolls-out-its-grok-ai-assistant-to-australia-and-new-zealand-drivers\">Cybertruck production</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The diner has proven a bit controversial—why is Tesla in the food service industry to begin with?—but considering that it also offers 80 V4 charging stalls, it is a welcome port in a storm. Diners can not only recharge their cars, but also get food, and view movies from screens in the parking lot or on the rooftop patio known as the Skypad. The fact that the diner is actually made with recycled materials certainly does not hurt matters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy, Hold or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 48.04% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">average TSLA price target</a> of $396.80 per share implies 1.85% downside risk.</p>",

Revenue is anticipated to increase by 101% to $1.5 billion.</p>\n<p>However, Evercore's Amit Daryanani, an analyst ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, believes the company can beat that figure given what he views as a \"de-risked setup.\" Recall that in the prior quarter management reduced its CY25 revenue guide to account for temporary delays in delivering powered-shell data center capacity in Q4.</p>\n<p>He also sees potential to outperform the Street's $138 million EBIT forecast, though EPS may be harder to model accurately as CRWV continues investing to scale operations.</p>\n<p>For the December quarter, Daryanani thinks investor attention will center on the schedule for powered-shell data center deliveries, progress in locking in incremental long-term capacity and the funding environment – with the broadened NVIDIA partnership viewed as a supportive factor – as well as the read-through for CY26 revenue.</p>\n<p>Recent reporting referencing internal memos about a \"chip delivery milestone\" at a facility in Denton, Texas, indicated that more than 16,000 GPUs were operational by late December and that total data center capacity could approach roughly 850 MW by year-end. Against that backdrop, the analyst thinks the Q1 Street revenue forecast of about $2.3 billion appears attainable. Daryanani sees the Q4 backlog landing in the mid-to-high $50 billion range, largely unchanged from Q3, as the company prioritizes securing additional data center capacity, with revenue primarily constrained by supply rather than demand.</p>\n<p>Additional topics investors will be monitoring include the transition from Blackwell to Rubin and how the ramp timing could affect revenue; availability of powered-shell data center capacity, including updates on self-built facilities; and the strategy to generate revenue from software offerings such as SUNK and Mission Control by selling them to other cloud providers. Overall, while strong demand and the debate over GPU useful life – with several data points suggesting GPUs can remain productive for more than 10 years – are well understood, the 5-star analyst thinks attention has increasingly shifted toward CRWV's ability to secure the capacity required to sustain future expansion.</p>\n<p>All told, Daryanani maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $160 price target that points toward 12-month returns of 65%. (To watch Daryanani's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/amit-daryanani\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The rest of the Street's ratings splits into an even 8 Buys and Holds, each, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $118.57, the average target implies shares will gain 22% over the one-year timeframe. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">See CRWV stock forecast</a>)</p>",

In addition, the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> leader provided fiscal first quarter revenue guidance of $78 billion, plus or minus 2%, which was above the estimate of $72.6 billion as well.</p>\n<p>However, the results weren't good enough for investors, with <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-is-the-stock-market-down-today-2-26-26\">NVDA selling off amid continued fears of a bubble in AI</a>.
