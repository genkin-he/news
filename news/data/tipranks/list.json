            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>A key point that Cavanagh pointed out was that finding ways to add value is part of the job at Comcast, so if it did make a deal for Warner, it would be particularly interested in streaming and studio assets, especially with the Versant spinoff coming. That is reasonable enough, of course; some of Warner's biggest assets are streaming and studio assets, leaving aside the Discovery Global content that is likely to get spun off either way.</p>\n<p>But Cavanagh also pointed out that Comcast is busily adding value regardless of any Warner deal. It has the NBA on its side now. It has been expanding Peacock, though Peacock is a shadow of HBO Max. The new theme park <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/pre-earnings/cmcsa-earnings-report-this-week-is-it-a-buy-ahead-of-earnings-pre-earnings\">does not hurt matters</a>. Oh, and then, Cavanagh pointed out almost smugly, there's the matter of Taylor Sheridan.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Matter of Taylor Sheridan</strong></h2>\n<p>In case you had not heard about this, the guy who made <em>Yellowstone</em> happen, as well as its various spin-offs, is now part of the Comcast ecosystem. Taylor Sheridan jumped ship, at least in part; his current contract with Paramount Skydance <a data-ticker=\"PSKY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/psky\">(PSKY)</a> keeps him in the fold until 2028, when he can also move his television skills over to Comcast.</p>\n<p>For now, though, Comcast has a film deal in the works with Sheridan. While Paramount plans to extract as much value out of Sheridan as possible before he can completely leave, Comcast will still be in line for plenty of content. Paramount will keep a ton of properties, including <em>The Dutton Ranch</em>, <em>The Madison</em>, and several others.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Comcast Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on CMCSA stock based on nine Buys, nine Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 34.67% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cmcsa\">loss in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cmcsa/forecast\">average CMCSA price target</a> of $40.36 per share implies 44.84% upside potential.</p>",

On the other hand, Core Scientific's shares <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/corz/forecast\">are rising by about the same measure</a>. </p>\n<p>The rejection comes as CoreWeave's offer, put forward in July, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-core-scientific-corz-shareholders-likely-to-reject-coreweaves-acquisition-offer\">faced staunch criticism</a> from Core Scientific's shareholders, who believe the deal undervalues the company. However, the company, which is backed by Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a>, refused to raise its bid, emphasizing that the proposal is fair and reflects the Bitcoin miner's market value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does CoreWeave Need Core Scientific?</strong></h2>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/michael-n-intrator\">Michael Intrator</a>, CoreWeave's chief executive, recently pointed out that while Core Scientific would make a great addition to the company, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-ceo-says-the-firm-doesnt-need-core-scientific-if-acquisition-offer-is-rejected\">the business is not critical </a>to the company's plan. Reacting to the rejection, Intrator noted that his company \"respects the views\" of Core Scientific's shareholders and will continue collaborating with Core Scientific on \"shared opportunities\" by leveraging each company's strengths. </p>\n<p>According to Evercore ISI analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/amit-daryanani\">Amit Daryanani</a>, while merging with Core Scientific will help CoreWeave improve operational efficiency and expand power capacity, the New Jersey-based AI cloud computing company <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-can-thrive-without-core-scientific-says-top-analyst\">will flourish without it</a>.

The Xbox Series X|S has been a historical failure for Microsoft as well, only slightly outselling the original Xbox. That's saying something, as the original Xbox had to compete against the PlayStation 2, the best-selling console in history.</p>\n<p>The lackluster performance of Xbox might help explain recent changes at the video game maker. That includes price increases for the Xbox Series X|S, a higher subscription price for Xbox Game Pass, and the company's decision to go multiplatform instead of keeping first-party games exclusive to its console.</p>\n<p>This has some worried that Xbox is going the way of Sega <a data-ticker=\"SGAMY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sgamy\">(SGAMY)</a>, which exited the console market in March 2001 following the failure of the Sega Dreamcast. Ironically, that failure is part of what helped Microsoft enter the video game market later that year, when the original Xbox launched in November 2001.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Microsoft Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">Microsoft stock was down 3.28% on Thursday</a> but remained up 24.95% year-to-date.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alphabet Beats on Both Lines</strong></h2>\n<p>Earnings per share came in at $2.87, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/earnings\">crushing the $2.26 consensus</a> and rising from $2.12 a year ago. Revenue reached $102.3 billion, ahead of the $99.9 billion estimate and up 16% year over year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/financials\">Operating margin landed at 30.5%</a>. If you strip out a $3.5 billion European Commission fine, margin would have been 33.9%, a healthy step up from reported levels. GOOGL shares were up more than 5% around $289 in early trade.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google's Cloud Growth Rebuilds Confidence</strong></h2>\n<p>Google Cloud sales rose 34%, a clear acceleration story the Street wanted to see. Profitability improved too, with operating margin moving to 24% from 17% last year.</p>\n<p>This combination of faster growth and better margin is what investors have been waiting for from Google's AI stack. It suggests the platform is scaling, not just spending.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Capex Plan Grows to Fund AI</strong></h2>\n<p>Management lifted its 2025 capital-spending outlook for AI data centers to $92 billion, up from $85 billion. The company also guided to a \"significant increase\" in 2026.</p>\n<p>Alphabet has the balance-sheet strength to support it. The company sold $12.5 billion in bonds in May and still holds about $98 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google Ads Still Pay the Bills</strong></h2>\n<p>About 85% of revenue still comes from high-margin ads and services. Search and YouTube posted double-digit growth, and Android-related businesses showed strong momentum.</p>\n<p>One soft spot remains Google's third-party ad network, where sales continue to slide amid weaker open-web traffic and antitrust scrutiny. This unit could face changes if the U.S. case advances.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why the \"AI Loser\" Label Is Fading</strong></h2>\n<p>Cloud is winning more deals and throwing off margin. Core ads keep funding the heavy lifting in data centers. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/financials/cash-flow\">Cash flow from operations</a> topped $150 billion over the past 12 months, giving Alphabet fuel to invest without losing financial discipline.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Google is shifting from defending share to monetizing AI across products. The latest quarter shows that turn happening in the numbers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Look Out for Next</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, investors will be watching several key indicators. The first is how cloud bookings and margins trend through 2026 as Alphabet brings new capacity online. The second is whether there are any developments in the U.S. v. Google antitrust case, which could reshape the company's third-party ad network. Finally, attention will stay on free cash flow, especially as capital expenditures ramp up again next year.</p>\n<p>Overall, Alphabet delivered where it mattered most, showing that its cloud business can grow profitably while funding an even larger AI build-out. That's how Google is shedding its image as an AI underdog and positioning itself as a serious front-runner.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Google a Good Stock to Buy Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Alphabet holds a Strong Buy consensus based on 36 analyst ratings, with 28 Buys, eight Holds, and no Sells in the mix. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/forecast\">average 12-month GOOGL price target</a> is $293.43, suggesting a modest 1.85% upside from the recent close.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Earnings per share came in at $1.05, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/earnings\">far below analyst expectations</a> due to a one-time charge, while revenue hit $51.2 billion, up 26% from last year and ahead of estimates. But investors focused on what's next, and the numbers show a company spending faster than it's growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI Expansion Drives Expenses Higher</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's operating margin fell to 40%, down from 43% last year, as costs tied to its AI push surged. Research and development expenses jumped 28%, largely due to aggressive hiring across Meta's <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> unit.</p>\n<p>The company also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast once again, now expecting around $71 billion, up from $69 billion, with an even steeper increase expected in 2026. This figure cements Meta's position as one of the largest corporate spenders in the world, fueled by a race to expand its AI data centers and in-house compute infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that the spending is already showing results. \"It's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business,\" he said. \"That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more.\"</p>\n<p>Still, investors appear skeptical. Unlike Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, or Google <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, which rent out their AI infrastructure through cloud platforms, Meta's massive data centers are built for its own internal use. This is a strategy that could take longer to pay off.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balance Sheet Pressure Mounts</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's aggressive capital plan is reshaping its financial profile. For the second straight quarter, the company reported more debt, tax, and lease liabilities than cash and short-term investments, deepening its shift toward a more asset-heavy model.</p>\n<p>Even though operational cash flow rose 21% year over year, free cash flow fell by 35% once capital spending was deducted. To offset some of that strain, Meta recently announced a $27 billion joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, moving its Hyperion data center off the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Meta wants AI woven through all its platforms, from ad targeting to its Meta AI assistant. But for now, investors seem to be asking how much longer the company can keep spending at this pace before returns catch up.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite its post-earnings pullback, analysts remain broadly bullish on Meta Platforms (META). Out of 46 Wall Street analysts, 40 rate the stock a Buy and six a Hold, giving it a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average 12-month META price target</a> is $875.90, implying an upside of about 33.7% from the current price.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Going forward, FMC said it will <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fmc-falls-42-4-thefly\">pay a quarterly dividend </a>of $0.08, down from $0.48 previously. The dividend cut has sent FMC stock spiraling downward. The dividend cut was announced by management alongside the company's latest financial results. </p>\n<p>FMC, which specializes in chemicals designed to protect farmers' crops, reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89, which topped the $0.85 forecast among analysts. However, the company announced revenue of $961 million, which was short of the $1.1 billion expected on Wall Street.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Debt and Dividend</strong></h2>\n<p>FMC, which is headquartered in Philadelphia, ended the year's third quarter with $4.5 billion of debt. Management guided for earnings of $850 million in 2025, below Wall Street's projection of $911 million. The combination of slowing growth and hefty debt led to the dramatic divided cut, said senior executives. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fmc-downgraded-to-equal-weight-from-overweight-at-barclays-thefly\">Before the dividend cut</a>, FMC stock was yielding about 6.6%. Going forward, the stock's dividend yield will be about 1.6%, depending on the share price. Even before the dividend cut, FMC stock had struggled, falling 40% on the year, hurt by falling farm income and weak agriculture prices.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is FMC Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>FMC Corp.'s stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 13 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on five Buy and eight Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fmc/forecast\">average FMC price target </a>of $40.08 implies 144% upside from current levels. These ratings might change on news of the dividend cut. </p>",
