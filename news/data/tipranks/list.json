            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Hougan argues that the key to success isn't winning over crypto insiders, but <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-wakes-up-from-its-slump-with-eyes-on-3-and-a-new-etf-catalyst\">rather tapping into real investor enthusiasm</a>. \"What drives flows? A group of people that buys the asset — and the XRP Army is incredibly bullish and loves XRP,\" he said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>XRP ETF Filings Multiply as Whales Move In</strong></h2>\n<p>At the moment, there are roughly 20 XRP ETF applications pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That puts it just behind <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> and Solana, each with about 23 filings, and ahead of Ethereum's 16, according to <em>Bloomberg</em> Intelligence's Eric Balchunas.</p>\n<p>Balchunas expects the number of crypto-based ETFs, currently fewer than five, to exceed 200 within the next year, as institutional appetite continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, big investors are already positioning themselves. Data from Santiment shows that whales have scooped up nearly $560 million in XRP over the past week. The buying spree coincides with several <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-price-fumbles-as-lawyer-says-there-seems-to-always-be-unexpected-delays-with-xrp\">XRP ETF approval deadlines approaching at the SEC</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Then There's the XRP Army Factor</strong></h2>\n<p>For Hougan, the XRP story is more about the community. This conviction stems from what he calls the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/how-the-xrp-army-tilted-the-scales-in-ripples-fight-with-the-sec\">\"XRP Army,\" a loyal group of retail investors</a> who have stood by Ripple's token through years of controversy, including its drawn-out legal battle with the SEC.</p>\n<p>\"Flows will dramatically exceed what people are expecting,\" Hougan said. \"<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf\">ETFs</a> die in apathy, and that won't be the case here.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike many altcoins praised for their technical promise but ignored by traders, XRP's power lies in its people. Despite criticism of its centralized structure and corporate ties to Ripple, the token has retained one of crypto's most passionate followings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Critics May Be Missing the Main Point</strong></h2>\n<p>Skeptics often highlight Ripple's control over XRP's supply and its focus on institutional payments rather than decentralization. But Hougan thinks that critique misses the point entirely.</p>\n<p>Institutional adoption, he argues, doesn't require crypto purists' approval; it requires buyers. He points to Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted $107 billion in their first year, despite widespread doubt before launch. And just this week, a new staked Solana ETF posted the biggest debut of any ETF in 2025.</p>\n<p>Both examples, Hougan says, prove that real demand outweighs ideology. At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP is sitting at $2.5219</a>.</p>",

The weakness comes as traders lose faith that Swell will deliver the kind of excitement or announcements that once triggered pre-event rallies.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Different This Time</strong></h2>\n<p>Ripple's Swell conference has a strong lineup this year, featuring White House <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> adviser Patrick Witt and executives from BlackRock <a data-ticker=\"BLK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/blk\">(BLK)</a>, Nasdaq <a data-ticker=\"NDAQ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ndaq\">(NDAQ)</a>, Citi <a data-ticker=\"C\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/c\">(C)</a>, and BNY Mellon <a data-ticker=\"BNY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/mutual-funds/bny\">(BNY)</a>. Key sessions will focus on tokenized assets, cross-border payments, and stablecoin settlements on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Nasdaq's Adena Friedman will headline the event.</p>\n<p>On paper, that is the kind of agenda that used to move markets. In the past, Swell weeks brought big short-term surges for XRP, like in 2017, when the price doubled ahead of the San Francisco event, or 2018, when it spiked 50% before Toronto.</p>\n<p>This year, investor sentiment feels different. The market seems tired of waiting for new partnerships or adoption stories to show up in the charts. Even with improved regulatory clarity after Ripple's courtroom wins, traders appear more cautious than excited.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technicals Tell a Bearish Story</strong></h2>\n<p>On the charts, things do not look great either. XRP has formed a rounded top pattern since late October, suggesting more downside ahead. The price recently tested $2.37, a key neckline level, and a confirmed drop below it could open the door to $2.09, a 16% fall from current levels.</p>\n<p>Volume has also dipped about 8% in the past 24 hours, showing weaker buyer interest. Both the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd/technical-analysis\">RSI and MACD indicators are flashing bearish signals</a>, while XRP remains capped under its 50-day SMA at $2.55 and 200-day SMA at $2.84.</p>\n<p>In short, the bulls seem exhausted.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Next for XRP</strong></h2>\n<p>If Ripple's Swell delivers real news, such as new institutional partnerships or clear progress on tokenized finance, the price could bounce again. If not, XRP may keep sliding toward the lower $2 range as traders sell early and wait on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>Either way, all eyes will be on New York next week to see whether Ripple can bring back some of its old momentum or if Swell ends up being another quiet chapter for XRP.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP is sitting at $2.5393</a>.</p>",

Further, gross margin came in at 47.2%, slightly above forecasts, even after accounting for a $1.1 billion <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> impact.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Apple guided for 10% to 12% revenue growth in the December quarter, which is 6% above consensus. However, Lee said that his forecast rose only slightly as he expects a $100 price hike for the iPhone 18 (meant to cover higher costs) might hurt sales and profit margins due to a weaker product mix.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the analyst sees a strong start to Fiscal 2026 and potential upside from a rumored iPhone 18 Fold, which could help offset any downside. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Ahead for AAPL?</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple's biggest hurdles in 2025 stem from rising component costs, slower iPhone volume growth, and global supply chain disruptions. Also, the tech giant faces tough competition, especially as rivals ramp up innovation in foldables, AI, and wearables.</p>\n<p>Further, regulatory pressures and tariff uncertainty remain key concerns. Though <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-ramps-up-india-production-amid-rising-u-s-india-trade-rift\">Apple has shifted some production to India</a>, recent U.S. tariffs targeting Indian <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> have raised concerns about future cost structures.</p>\n<p>Despite these headwinds, Apple's long-term outlook seems encouraging. Its high-margin Services segment, spanning iCloud, App Store, Apple Music, and more, continues to grow rapidly and helps offset hardware volatility. Moreover, the rumored iPhone 18 Fold could be a game-changer, potentially leading to a new upgrade cycle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AAPL Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, Apple stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">average AAPL price target</a>&nbsp;of $264.07 implies 2.43% downside risk from current levels.</p>",
