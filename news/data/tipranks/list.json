            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Wall Street banking heavyweight JPMorgan <a data-ticker=\"JPM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jpm\">(JPM)</a> boosted its price target for Apple's stock, pointing to a \"higher than usual level of confidence from management.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apple Earnings Beat Wall Street</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple on Thursday released its fourth-quarter results, showing <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple\">sales jumped 8% year-over-year</a>, driven by solid performance in its Services segment and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-sees-strongest-iphone-growth-since-the-pandemic\">strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 series</a>. Revenue from this segment climbed 15% year-over-year, elevated by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The California-based company also saw its earnings per share rise 13% YoY to $1.85, beating Wall Street's projected $1.78. Overall revenue slightly surpassed analysts' expectations of $102.17 billion, coming in at $102.5 billion. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here's Why Wall Street Is Turning Bullish on Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings beat, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee\">JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee</a> raised his AAPL price target by more than 12% to $305 per share, up from $290. </p>\n<p>The five-star analyst, who maintained his Overweight rating on the stock, noted that iPhone sales traction has helped Apple polish its outlook for the new fiscal year better than expected. Goldman Sachs also <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-aapl-goldman-sachs-boosts-price-targets-on-these-2-magnificent-7-stocks-after-solid-earnings-beat\">echoed a similar sentiment</a>.</p>\n<p>Following its Q4 performance, Apple now expects to rake in 10% to 12% more in revenue by the second quarter of its Fiscal Year 2026 — that is, between January and March next year. Chatterjee noted that this will be the company's highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. </p>\n<p>Subsequently, JPMorgan \"materially\" lifted its revenue growth forecast for Apple, believing it will continue to sustain its product cycle momentum. </p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wamsi-mohan\">Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan</a> raised his price target from $320 to $325, noting that Apple surprised Wall Street's projections with its 47.2% gross profit margin, even after a $1.1 billion charge from tariffs during the quarter. </p>\n<p>Mohan believes the company will post even better margins in Q2, riding on expected easing of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> conditions and a shift in revenue composition, with a greater proportion emerging from its&nbsp;Services&nbsp;segment. The five-star analyst further pointed to the anticipated introduction of AI-enhanced Siri and the launch of a foldable iPhone smart device by September.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Will Apple Stock Reach $700 Again?</strong></h2>\n<p>Across the broader Wall Street, however, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">Apple's shares</a> currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, 12 Holds, and three Sells assigned by 35 analysts over the past three months. </p>\n<p>Moreover, at $266.24, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">the AAPL price target</a> suggests about 2% downside risk.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/financials\">Profit fell to $7.55 billion</a> from $8.61 billion a year ago as crude prices slid and costs rose. The stock was down about 2% premarket. It is still up 6.6% year to date.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lower Oil Prices Pressure Margins and Cash</strong></h2>\n<p>Declining benchmarks continue to bite. Oil futures are down roughly 16% this year, squeezing upstream margins and tempering cash generation. This explains why a clean EPS beat did not translate into a stronger tape.</p>\n<p>Management highlighted relative performance against that backdrop. As CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/darren-woods\">Darren Woods</a> put it, \"We delivered the highest earnings per share we've had compared to other quarters in a similar oil-price environment.\" Investors, however, are focused on where margins go next if crude stays in the mid-60s.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exxon Ramps Up Production</strong></h2>\n<p>Exxon increases barrels while others pull back. Daily production rose to 4.77 million barrels of oil equivalent from 4.58 million last year, ahead of the 4.7 million many on the Street expected.</p>\n<p>More barrels help offset weak prices, but they also raise the question of capital discipline if the macro softens further. The long-term plan still targets growth to 2030; near-term returns hinge on price, mix, and refining strength.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exxon <strong>Guidance and Peers Shape the Trade</strong></h2>\n<p>Exxon frames expectations around steady execution. Investors will watch any color on fourth-quarter run-rates, refining margins, and capital spend if crude drifts toward $60. These inputs will drive the next move in free cash flow and buybacks.</p>\n<p>Peers matter too. Chevron's <a data-ticker=\"CVX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cvx\">(CVX)</a> stronger print gives the group a reference point, but dispersion is likely as product cracks, chemicals, and project timing differ by company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>What Could Move the Stock Next</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Three things drive the next leg: the path of crude, the pace of cost control, and how much upside refining can still deliver. If oil stabilizes and downstream stays firm, today's weakness can fade. If prices slip again, the market will demand tighter capex and clearer return targets.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Exxon beat on EPS but the revenue miss and softer profit reminded investors that the macro still calls the tune. Shares can find their footing if cash flow trends improve into year-end; until then, the bias stays cautious</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Exxon Mobil a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Wall Street's consensus rating for XOM stock is a Moderate Buy, with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">average analyst price target</a>&nbsp;of $127.58, implying upside potential of 11.2% from current levels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom\">XOM shares have gained about 9.6% year-to-date</a>.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fourth Site</strong></h2>\n<p>Uber, which reports Q3 earnings next week, said it was investing $200 million over five years in the new software and technology center in Istanbul, making it the company's fourth major hub outside of the U.S.  It has similar sites in Brazil, the Netherlands and India. </p>\n<p>It is expected that the investment will be spent on areas such as developing <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> in the form of ride-matching and pricing algorithms, mapping and routing. According to a report in <em>Meyka</em>, it will also invest in back-end infrastructure for delivery and logistics as well as hiring software engineers, data scientists and building laboratories.</p>\n<p>For example, Uber has previously hailed development work in India on its Uber Bus and micromobility products.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Focus</strong></h2>\n<p>It marks Uber out as no longer just a ride-hailing firm but one focused on delivery, freight and mobility technologies. </p>\n<p>Uber already has a presence in Turkey with the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/uber-acquires-majority-stake-in-trendyol-go\">acquisition earlier this year of an 85% controlling stake</a> in Trendyol GO, a leading online meal and grocery delivery service for approximately $700 million. The aim was to enhance Uber's growth and strengthen its delivery sector presence in Turkey benefiting consumers, couriers, and small businesses.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",
