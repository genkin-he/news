The other report reaffirmed earlier reports that although Tesla's robotaxi rides are cheaper than Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> Waymo, they come with longer waiting times and largely have human drivers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>No Robotaxi Test Driving in California?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, records from California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) showed that Tesla logged no miles of autonomous test driving in the state in 2025. Tesla already has an entry-level permit from the state authority, but requires additional permits to operate fully driverless in the state.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Jefferies <a data-ticker=\"JEF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jef\">(JEF)</a> analysts took several rides in Tesla and Waymo's ride-hailing robotaxi services and found that booking a Tesla failed more than 25% of the time. This is even though Tesla rides turned out to be cheaper due to higher discounts provided.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Eyes Robotaxi Rollout</strong></h2>\n<p>Tesla started to test its robotaxi service in Austin in June last year, rolling out with human safety operators, and later in December kicked off unsupervised and driverless rides in the state. The company later launched a human-supervised service in the San Francisco Bay Area of California in late July and plans to expand to other U.S. states this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has drummed up its robotaxi rollout growth strategy, recently moving <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/elon-musk-ends-fsd-buyouts-what-the-subscription-push-means-for-tesla-stock\">to a monthly subscription model</a> for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. This comes as the automaker's vehicle sales <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-tsla-jumps-despite-missing-q4-delivery-expectations\">fell for the second consecutive year</a> in 2025. </p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Tesla <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/wrongfully-and-baselessly-tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-gains-as-tesla-pursues-california\">sued California auto authorities</a> over an earlier ruling that concluded that it falsely promoted its vehicles as self-driving. The California DMV had contended that Tesla in 2022 marketed its Autopilot and FSD systems to suggest they were autonomously operated when they required a safety driver.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">Tesla's shares</a>&nbsp;remain a Hold based on analysts' consensus rating. This breaks down to 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned by 30 analysts over the past three months.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">the average TSLA price target</a> of $396.80 implies about 5%&nbsp;downside risk from current trading levels.</p>",

Adjusted <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trade-desk-reports-q4-eps-59c-consensus-58c-thefly-news\">EPS came in at $0.59, beating the $0.58 consensus</a>. For the full year, TTD posted $2.9 billion in revenue, up 18% from 2024.</p>\n<p>While profitability remained solid, net income margins slipped, falling to 22% in Q4 from 25% a year earlier and declining to 15% for the full year from 16%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wells Fargo Lowers TTD Target on Market Concerns</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the results, analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/alec-brondolo\">Alec Brondolo</a> at Wells Fargo lowered the price target on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trade-desk-price-target-lowered-to-25-from-42-at-wells-fargo-thefly-news\">TTD stock to $25 from $42</a>, maintaining a Hold rating. He noted that Q4 results came in line with expectations, but Q1 revenue and EBITDA guidance came in 2% and 12% below estimates, respectively.</p>\n<p>While management cited macro weakness in the Auto and CPG sectors, Brondolo noted that ongoing competitive pressures and take-rate concerns likely leave investor worries unresolved.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BofA Cuts TTD Target</strong> <strong>on Weak Margins</strong></h2>\n<p>BofA five-star analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jessica-reif-ehrlich\">Jessica Reif Ehrlich</a> cut the price target on TTD stock from $40 to $20 while maintaining a Sell rating. She noted that guidance for the upcoming quarter points to slower revenue growth and significantly weaker margins, driven by softer demand in key advertising categories and higher planned investments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ratings/underperform-initiation-on-the-trade-desk-slowing-growth-margin-pressure-and-rising-competition-undermine-premium-valuation-ratings-news\">Ehrlich also highlighted rising competition</a> from well-funded rivals, which pressures pricing and makes near-term performance less predictable. While long-term growth drivers remain, she believes reduced earnings estimates, a lower margin profile, and a growth trajectory more in line with adtech peers no longer justify the stock's historical premium.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Trade Desk a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttd\">Trade Desk's stock</a> has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 28 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buys, 13 Holds, and two Sells issued in the last three months.

            "title": "SanDisk Stock (SNDK) Is on a Tear, But Does Upside Remain?",
            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>SanDisk <a data-ticker=\"SNDK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk\">(SNDK)</a> stock has been on a tear, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk\">up 1,258% in the past 12 months</a>. However, there are probably only about six to nine months of upside left, so I rate the stock a Hold right now. The company is a NAND flash memory and storage supplier that's critical in the datacenter boom. With consensus modeling earnings growth normalization in Fiscal 2028, and markets pricing about 12 months in advance, around mid-to-late 2026 appears the most likely window when SNDK stock will start to drop (the company's financial year ends in June).&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Consensus Upside Points to Further Growth Ahead</strong></h2>\n<p>Consensus points to a sharp earnings ramp into June 2026, whereby EPS will rise by nearly 1,230% year-over-year, followed by a 103% gain in Fiscal 2027. Based on my analysis, this means that we have probably 50% upside left at most in SNDK before the rally begins to break. This is just an estimate, but the equity is one I prefer to avoid, given it's highly cyclical and we are late in the bull run.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If SNDK stock delivers EPS of $80 in Fiscal 2027, aligning with consensus, and trades at a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/statistics\">forward P/E of just 12</a>, which is much lower than the present 16.75 but would reflect deteriorating sentiment as growth slows, the stock price would peak at $960 per share by the end of Fiscal 2026. This would be the bull case, and reflects ongoing confidence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps more likely is that the P/E compresses further. Fiscal 2027 EPS of $80 and a forward P/E in June 2026 of 9 would reflect a $720 per share stock price. The current stock price is $650, so the implied upside in the base and bull outcomes is 11% to 48%. Obviously, a higher rally could occur, but I am not a buyer at the current position and risk-reward dynamics and maintain a neutral rating.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NAND Flash Offers a Cyclical Boom and Bust</strong></h2>\n<p>The core driver of this <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-sandisk-stock-sndk-is-crushing-the-sp-500-in-2026\">strong and short growth is NAND cyclicality</a>. Peak margins in Fiscal 2026 to Fiscal 2027 show tight supply and strong pricing, conditions that historically incentivize incremental capacity. As supply is ramped up in response, pricing typically shifts from rising to flat and then lower, which compresses earnings eventually. Even modest average selling price normalization can lead to outsized earnings stagnation in NAND markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We should also remember that if hyperscale or enterprise demand is partially front-loaded into Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027, a digestion phase can reduce growth in Fiscal 2028. This is not entirely unlikely, especially with the potential for energy bottlenecks to cause such a slowdown in demand. Clearly, the two-pronged impact of lower demand and higher prepared supply would not be good for SNDK investors. This is a primary reason why I remain neutral on the stock.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Datacenter Buildout Has Been the Center of SanDisk's Rise</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/earnings\">SanDisk's recent Q2 operating results</a> show revenue up 31% sequentially, with GAAP gross margin expanding to 50.9% from 29.8% in the prior quarter. Datacenter revenue specifically was up 64% sequentially, underscoring strong hyperscale demand. In Q3, gross margin is expected to be 64.9% to 66.9%, indicating powerful near-term momentum. However, we must remember that this is largely already priced in.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/financials\">balance sheet also supports the valuation throughout this cycle</a>, as it has $1.539 billion in cash versus $603 million in total debt. Net cash is therefore about $0.94 billion while Q2 free cash flow was $980 million. However, the company does have a joint venture with Kioxia Flash Ventures, where SanDisk pays variable costs plus half fixed costs regardless of output, meaning utilization swings can pressure margins significantly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is SanDisk Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, SanDisk has a consensus Moderate Buy rating, based on 11 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sells. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sndk/forecast?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">average SNDK price target</a> of $637.33 indicates a -0.19% downside potential over the next 12 months. The high target is $1,000 per share, but the low target is $235. This indicates a risky stock that is likely only worthwhile as a small, targeted allocation for the bulls out there.&nbsp;</p>",
