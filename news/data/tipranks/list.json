            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cybercab Debut</strong></h2>\n<p>The Elon Musk-led firm, whose sales have struggled in China in recent months, will debut its Cybercab robotaxi at the China International Import Expo (CIIE).</p>\n<p>\"The trade fair will help Tesla show how it is actively integrating <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> into the real world,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are redefining the labour, transportation, and new energy industries.\"</p>\n<p>According to the <em>South China Morning Post</em>, Tesla's appearance at the show marks a return to the Chinese stage after it \"skipped\" two major events in Shanghai, China's commercial hub, over the past two years. These were the Shanghai Auto Show in April and last year's CIIE.</p>\n<p>Tesla offered no explanation for the no-show at these events but perhaps the company had been left a little embarrassed by its recent sales performance in China.</p>\n<p>Its mainland sales fell 6% year on year in the first nine months of 2025, facing intense competition from domestic players such as Xpeng <a data-ticker=\"XPEV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xpev\">(XPEV)</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Brave Face</strong></h2>\n<p>However, it did <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-china-ev-sales-bounce-back-up-2-8-in-september\">record a 2.8% year-over-year sales hike in China-made EVs </a>in September, suggesting a corner may have been turned. It was helped by the launch of the six-seater Model Y SUV in the Chinese market as well as a host of incentives such as 0% APR financing on several models, paint credits, and free Full Self-Driving (FSD) transfer for new purchases.</p>\n<p>It is no doubt hoping the Cybercab showing will spark off more interest and demand.</p>\n<p>The company unveiled the Cybercab in the U.S. last year. Musk said then that Tesla aimed to produce more than 2 million units every year, with mass production expected to start next year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>During the first quarter, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> initiated a 20% <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China, citing the country's involvement in exporting the drug. As part of a trade truce reached earlier this week, he agreed to halve the tariff to 10%. Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady. Schmid warned that even a 25 bps rate cut wouldn't meaningfully affect labor market conditions but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/are-stocks-overbought-naaim-exposure-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-july-2024\">National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index</a>, which measures the exposure active investment managers have to U.S. stocks, climbed above 100 for the first time since July 2024.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In their latest results, Amazon reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $1.95 per share</a>, beating analysts' estimates of $1.57 per share, as revenue rose to $180.2 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-earnings-amazon-soars-after-aws-growth-helps-smash-eps-estimates\">driven by strong growth in its AWS</a> cloud division and advertising business. Meanwhile, Apple posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.85 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 8% to $102.5 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple\">supported by steady iPhone demand</a> and robust services growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sachs Stays Bullish on Amazon</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $290 from $275. The firm said that while investors may watch consumer spending closely, Amazon's core e-commerce, cloud, and ad businesses remain strong.</p>\n<p>The firm highlighted that AWS should gain from rising demand for AI tools among large companies, while Amazon's retail and delivery network keeps getting more efficient and lowering costs. He added that Amazon's advertising unit is growing quickly with high profit margins, becoming a bigger source of earnings.</p>\n<p>Goldman expects Amazon to keep improving both sales and margins in the coming years, supported by its mix of strong businesses and steady investment in new technology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sees Multi-Year Growth Cycle Ahead for Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman raised the price target on Apple to $320 from $279 and kept a Buy rating. He said Apple's latest results showed solid underlying demand, with the iPhone revenue miss tied to supply limits rather than weaker sales.</p>\n<p>Ng expects Apple to enter a multi-year product upgrade cycle, supported by new AI features, including a more advanced version of Siri and fresh AI partnerships. He also pointed to Apple's plans for new designs, such as a potential foldable iPhone in 2026, and ongoing investment across its product line.</p>\n<p>On the services side, revenue rose 15% year over year, lifted by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne. The firm added that Apple's margins remain strong, helped by a richer product mix and greater use of in-house technology.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Is the Best Tech Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=AAPL&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool</a> to see which of these 'Magnificent 7' names analysts favor more. Amazon holds a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating, supported by a 20.8% upside potential over the next 12 months. In comparison, Apple carries a \"Moderate Buy\" rating, with analysts expecting a modest 2.7% downside from current levels.</p>",

CoreWeave had aimed to save $500 million annually by 2027 through the merger, mainly by consolidating lease costs, but these savings are now off the table.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CoreWeave Can Capture Meaningful Share Alone</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz sees <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/top-analyst-sees-5-billion-boost-to-coreweaves-crwv-backlog-from-new-ai-deal\">CoreWeave as capturing a meaningful share of the AI cloud</a> provider market, although he had downgraded CRWV to a Hold rating in July due to the \"outsized returns\" since its IPO.</p>\n<p>While the merger rejection closed off opportunities to lower its cost of capital and access infrastructure-focused financing, CoreWeave remains committed to executing on its growth strategy.

Nvidia's contribution is expected to begin at around $500 million and could rise to $1 billion if the startup reaches its fundraising goals.

            "title": "Affirm Lands $750M Deal with New York Life despite Shaky Lending Environment",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>So far, New York Life has invested nearly $2 billion into Affirm's loan pools. Interestingly, this is part of a growing trend in which insurers and private-credit firms are investing more in consumer finance, as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> make these loans more profitable. For instance, Klarna <a data-ticker=\"KLAR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/klar\">(KLAR)</a> has collaborated with Nelnet <a data-ticker=\"NNI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nni\">(NNI)</a> and Pagaya <a data-ticker=\"PGY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pgy\">(PGY)</a>, while PayPal <a data-ticker=\"PYPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl\">(PYPL)</a> signed a $7 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital <a data-ticker=\"OWL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/owl\">(OWL)</a>.</p>\n<p>However, this new deal with New York Life comes at a time when the lending environment is uncertain. While consumer spending remains steady and late payments are easing, investors are still cautious after recent bankruptcies in subprime auto and consumer credit. Nevertheless, the continued support from major financial partners suggests that many still believe in Affirm's long-term potential, as it has financed over $100 billion in purchases and says that more than 90% of its borrowers return for repeat loans.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AFRM Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Affirm stock based on 14 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/afrm/forecast\">average Affirm price target</a> of $384 per share implies 17% upside potential.</p>",

Greg Abel, age 63, a longtime Berkshire executive, will become the new CEO of the diversified holding company.</p>\n<p>Abel will write Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letter in February 2026 after assuming the CEO role. He has been handling additional duties at Berkshire Hathaway since Buffett announced in May that he is stepping down from day-to-day leadership of the company he has run since 1965.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Letter to Shareholders</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-brk-b-separates-chairman-and-ceo-roles\">At next year's annual meeting</a>, Buffett plans to sit in the audience with other board members rather than on stage and answer shareholders' questions as he has done for decades, marking a major shift in his role as the face of Berkshire Hathaway.</p>\n<p>The contents of Buffett's upcoming Nov. 10 letter remain unclear. In similar letters issued in November 2023 and 2024, he discussed estate planning, expressed gratitude for opportunities provided by the U.S., and announced various charitable donations, including to organizations run by his children. The exact contents of the upcoming letter are not known. </p>\n<p>Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial results on Nov. 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is BRK.B Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Only a couple of analysts currently offer a rating and price target on Berkshire Hathaway's more affordable Class B stock.

As one can see in the chart below, shares of BRK.B have risen 0.99% in the last 12 weeks.</p>",
