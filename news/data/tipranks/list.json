            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>The stock market had a surprise for investors today. MARA Holdings <a data-ticker=\"MARA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara\">(MARA)</a>, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings, stock skyrocketed by over 16% in a single day. This happened even though the company told everyone it lost $1.71 billion in the last three months of 2025. Usually, a big loss like that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/mara-holdings-price-target-lowered-to-11-from-15-at-rosenblatt-thefly-news\">makes a stock go down</a>. However, the company also shared a new plan to move into the world of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>. Investors liked that news so much that they started buying the stock immediately.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bitcoin Dip Creates a Paper Loss</strong></h2>\n<p>The giant loss did not come from the company spending too much cash on its offices or workers. Instead, it was mostly a paper loss. Because the price of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">BTC-USD</a></strong>) fell from about $114,000 in September to $88,000 in December, MARA Holdings had to lower the value of the 53,822 Bitcoin it owns on its books.</p>\n<p>MARA Holdings reports this loss in order to follow accounting rules. About $1.5 billion of the total loss came from this change in Bitcoin's price. Even though the company mined 6% fewer Bitcoin this quarter, they still have a massive pile of digital coins worth roughly $4.7 billion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Partnership Creates AI Data Centers</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors ignored the bad financial numbers because of a new deal with a group called Starwood Digital Ventures. MARA Holdings is changing from just being a Bitcoin miner into a company that builds digital infrastructure. This partnership will turn some of the company's power sites into big data centers for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and computing.</p>\n<p>The Starwood deal builds enough power capacity to run 750,000 homes in its first phase. CEO Fred Thiel says this plan allows the company to turn power certainty into capacity certainty. This means MARA Holdings will use its access to electricity to help tech companies run their AI tools. This is a very big move that could help the company make more steady money in the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hybrid Model Makes MARA Less Dependent on BTC Prices</strong></h2>\n<p>Wall Street likes this new hybrid plan because it makes the company less dependent on Bitcoin prices. By building these data centers, MARA Holdings can get paid rent by big companies like they are a landlord. At the same time, they can still mine Bitcoin whenever it is profitable to do so.</p>\n<p>This new direction shifts the company toward a market that is growing very fast. Experts think the demand for AI power will grow by over 250% by the year 2030. MARA Holdings owns the land and the power lines already, so they can build these centers faster than other companies. Investors are betting that owning the electricity is just as valuable as owning the Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MARA Holdings a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, MARA stock (MARA) commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on one Buy, six Hold, and five Sell ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara/forecast\">average 12-month MARA price target</a>&nbsp;of $12&nbsp;implies 42% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara\">MARA shares have fallen 35.6%</a>.</p>",

Fortunately, there are plenty of such signals to choose from.</p>\n<p>One of the best comes from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a>, an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-powered data tool from TipRanks. The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a> gathers and collates the volumes of raw information put out by the markets every day – and puts that information to work. It uses that data to rate every stock in the public markets – and give each one a score, based on a set of factors that is known to correlate with future outperformance. The score is set on a simple, intuitive scale of 1 to 10 – with the 'Perfect 10' indicating stocks that the data says are solid.</p>\n<p>It's a good signal. And when Wall Street's analysts are in-line with it, putting their own 'Buy' recommendations on Perfect 10 stocks, that is a dual signal that should definitely be more compelling to discerning investors.</p>\n<p>So let's do just this. We've used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on two 'Perfect 10' stocks that are also getting high ratings from the analysts. Here they are.</p>\n<p><strong>Accenture</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acn/forecast\"><strong>ACN</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>The first 'Perfect 10' on today's list is Accenture, an IT services and consulting company with a global footprint and a strong bent toward AI and data sciences. Accenture offers business and enterprise clients the services they need to reinvent the ways they remain relevant to customers. From cloud and cybersecurity to AI and data, to marketing, learning, and finance – Accenture can build all of these, and more.</p>\n<p>To do this, Accenture brings together the combined expertise of a large, worldwide workforce, over 780,000 strong, and matches it with proprietary tech platforms and assets, and deep knowledge of the full ecosystem in today's corporate world and its combination of digital tech and business.</p>\n<p>Accenture, with its $121 billion market cap and global reach, has the resources to become the 'reinvention partner of choice' for some of today's biggest business players. The company's partners include such major names as SAP, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, and Salesforce.</p>\n<p>The company has found great success in this approach, and that can be seen from its fiscal 2025 results. In that fiscal year, the last with full data on record, Accenture devoted $3.3 billion to ventures &amp; acquisitions, research &amp; development, and learning &amp; development; in all, it was a large investment in the company's own future. In addition, Accenture brought in $69.7 billion in annual revenue and returned $8.3 billion in cash to shareholders, mainly through its common-stock dividend.</p>\n<p>In December, Accenture reported its results for fiscal 1Q26. The company generated $18.7 billion in revenue, for a 6% year-over-year increase, and beat the forecast by over $210 million. At the bottom line, the company's non-GAAP EPS of $3.94 was up 10% year-over-year and was 22 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley's James Faucette, in covering this stock, notes that most of any headwinds are already accounted for – and that Accenture has a sound path forward. He writes, \"We think 1) market fears around potential Gen AI disruption and 2) DOGE impact are now largely baked into ACN's current valuation at 19x FY27 EPS; further, we think M&amp;A and ecosystem partnerships are growth levers. We believe estimates have likely bottomed and that future revisions are skewed to the upside, driven by lower <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> and more industry clarity on AI investment path. Our growth estimates (FY26: +5%; FY27: +7% ) sit well above consensus growth figures… With a 4.5:1 Bull-Bear skew, we find ACN compelling at current valuation levels (~13% discount to S&amp;P 500).\"</p>\n<p>Faucette's Overweight (Buy) rating comes with a $320 price target that points to a one-year gain for the stock of 54%. (To watch Faucette's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/james-faucette\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Overall, these shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the Street's analyst consensus, based on 17 reviews that include 12 Buys and 5 Holds. The stock is selling for $207.38 right now, and its $293.60 average target price implies a 41.5% upside by this time next year. (See <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acn/forecast\"><strong>ACN stock forecast</strong></a>.)</p>",

Similarly, quarterly revenue fell by 95% from the year-ago quarter to $1.8 million, vastly falling short of the consensus of about $7.2 million.</p>\n<p>In the third quarter of the year, the revenue <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nuscale-power-stock-smr-sells-off-in-2025-can-it-rebound-135-in-2026\">came in at $8.2 million</a>. For the full year, revenue declined by 15% year-over-year to $31.5 million, with net loss also widening by 92% to $664.12 million. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why NuScale Power's Revenue Fell in 2025</strong></h2>\n<p>NuScale blamed the decline in yearly revenue on lower earnings from its technology license agreement entered into in 2024 with RoPower, a venture jointly owned by Nuclearelectrica, Romania's state nuclear operator, and Nova Power &amp; Gas, a private Romanian energy company. In Q3 2025, services provided to RoPower helped the company <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nuscale-power-stock-smr-sells-off-in-2025-can-it-rebound-135-in-2026\">grow its revenue massively</a> to $8.2 million.</p>\n<p>However, NuScale noted that the decline was offset by earnings generated from providing engineering services to its major shareholder, Fluor <a data-ticker=\"FLR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/flr\">(FLR)</a>, for phase 2 of the latter's Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study for RoPower's power plant in Doicești, Romania.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NuScale Eyes Commercialization in 2026</strong></h2>\n<p>Explaining the \"breakthrough\" statement, Hopkins noted that it worked with energy developer ENTRA1 — which is the company's global commercialization partner — to enter a nonbinding collaborative agreement with the U.S. public utility, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). </p>\n<p>Under the arrangement, both companies will work together to deploy NuScale's small modular reactors (SMR) to deliver up to six gigawatts of nuclear energy capacity to the TVA.</p>\n<p>\"As we move into 2026, our primary focus will be on the commercialization of our SMR technology, including ensuring full readiness for the manufacturing of our first NuScale Power ModuleTM,\" Hopkins added.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is SMR a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street, analysts currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smr\">NuScale Power's shares</a> based on four Buys, five Holds, and one Sell recommended over the past three months. However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smr/forecast\">the average SMR price target</a> of $21.19 implies about 59% upside.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that analyst ratings may change following the latest earnings report.</p>",

Nonetheless, IDC expects Apple <a data-ticker=\"AAPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">(AAPL)</a> and Samsung <a data-ticker=\"SSNLF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">(SSNLF)</a> to gain market share despite the ongoing challenges.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IDC Warns of Sharp Decline in Smartphone Shipments</strong></h2>\n<p>IDC believes that large players such as Apple and Samsung have solid balance sheets and premium positioning in the smartphone market. This would shield them from the ongoing memory crisis compared to smaller players. Notably, IDC expects low-end Android phone makers to be the most affected. Meanwhile, IDC projects that the average selling price of smartphones will rise by 14% to $523 in 2026, as smartphone makers move toward higher-margin models to mitigate rising costs.</p>\n<p>Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC's Mobile Phone Tracker, cautioned that the ongoing rise in memory chip prices will not just result in a temporary drop in smartphone shipments, but will lead to a \"structural reset\" of the entire market. Specifically, Popal expects the sub-$100 smartphone segment, which comprises 171 million devices, to become \"permanently uneconomical\" even after memory prices stabilize by mid-2027.</p>\n<p>Memory chip prices have been rising as tech giants like Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, and Meta Platforms <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a> have been securing much of the supply as they invest aggressively to build <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AAPL Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Last month, Apple reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple-stock-rises-after-firm-smashes-estimates\">upbeat results for the December quarter</a>, reflecting resilience amid challenging business conditions and intense competition. The company generated a 23% surge in its iPhone revenue, driven by solid demand for the iPhone 17 models released in September 2025. While the company experienced minimal impact from memory prices in the December quarter, it expects a greater impact in the March quarter.</p>\n<p>Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Apple stock based on 17 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">AAPL stock price target</a> of $307.55 indicates 12.7% upside potential.</p>",

It is a first of its kind AI Factory, wholly owned and operated by a pharmaceutical company. Lilly positions LillyPod not as mere IT infrastructure, but as a revolutionary scientific instrument, like a telescope or microscope, that transforms drug discovery.</p>\n<p>LillyPod handles the full AI lifecycle, from large-scale model training to high-volume inference. Traditional wet labs test roughly 2,000 molecular ideas per target annually, while LillyPod lets scientists explore billions of hypotheses in parallel in the \"dry lab.\"</p>\n<p>LillyPod uses nearly 5,000 fiber cable connections, weighing over 1,000 pounds, for its links.

LillyPod went live on day one, fueling applications in genomics, molecule and peptide design, single-cell biology, imaging, manufacturing, and enterprise operations. This builds on Lilly and Nvidia's recent co-innovation lab in South San Francisco, reflecting Lilly's push beyond pilots to enterprise-scale AI with robust talent, governance, and responsible AI frameworks.</p>\n<p>LillyPod signals pharma's AI arms race, where rivals like Pfizer <a data-ticker=\"PFE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pfe\">(PFE)</a> and Sanofi <a data-ticker=\"SNY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sny\">(SNY)</a> have also partnered with Nvidia, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/how-jnj-tem-and-lly-used-ai-to-redefine-healthcare-compounding\">potentially slashing drug discovery timelines</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is LLY Stock Worth Buying?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain highly optimistic about Eli Lilly's long-term prospects.
