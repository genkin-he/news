Prices have now increased for a fourth consecutive month. Year over year, the index rose 2.9%, also above the forecast of 2.6%. PPI is closely watched because several of its components feed into the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/pce-price-index-yoy-60\">Personal Consumption Expenditures</a> (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/core-ppi-mom-142\">Core PPI</a>, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.8% in January and increased 3.6% year over year, marking its highest annual rate since March 2025. Both readings came in well above expectations of 0.3% and 3.0%, respectively.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dow-jones-slumps-on-concerning-ppi-inflation-data\">PPI growth was largely driven by a 0.8% monthly rise in services</a>, the highest since July 2025, while goods prices declined 0.3%. More than 20% of the services gain stemmed from a 14.4% jump in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling.</p>\n<p>\"Retailers' <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> bill has come down marginally in the last few months, but they have continued to lift their selling prices,\" wrote Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief U.S. Economist Samuel Tombs.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ubs-downgrades-u-s-stock-market-on-dollar-risks-slowing-buybacks\">UBS downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\"</a> in a fully invested global equity portfolio, citing factors including stretched valuations, weakness in the dollar, fewer corporate buybacks, and global diversification outside of the U.S. The firm noted that a 10% drop in the dollar's trade-weighted index typically leads U.S. equities to underperform by about 4% on an unhedged basis. Additionally, U.S. buybacks have slowed and now closely match the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" wrote UBS Head of Global Equity Strategy <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/andrew-garthwaite\">Andrew Garthwaite</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/dow-jones\">Dow Jones</a> is down by 1.45% at the time of writing.</p>",

It plans to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/these-are-the-stocks-reporting-earnings-today-february-24-2026\">continue shutting</a> down theaters, open comparatively fewer theaters, and abandon original construction, instead working to acquire in-place theaters. AMC CEO Adam Aron noted, \"New build theaters are considerably more expensive than what we call spot acquisitions,\" surprising absolutely no one.</p>\n<p>Apparently, there are substantial numbers of empty theaters floating around out there. Aron noted that, back in 2021, it acquired a 14-screen theater at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles. And the pace of closures is on the rise; AMC closed 213 theaters last year, but only opened 65 new ones. This represented a 15% reduction in global portfolio operations, reports noted.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Purchased Seating</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, AMC plans to continue a plan that rewards long-term loyalty, by planning to \"block and reserve best seats\" for Stubs Premiere and A-List members. Those who are willing to pay the monthly membership fees get access to prime seating. Oddly, AMC did not actually define what it considers to be the \"best\" seats; some believe that sitting as close to the screen as possible is best. I personally have always favored the seat farthest back, directly underneath the projector port.</p>\n<p>But with AMC reporting a 10% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amc-earnings-movie-giant-hopes-spider-man-can-save-the-day-after-q4-revenues-slump\">decline in attendance</a> during the end of 2025, it was clear that AMC needed to do something to get people back in the theaters by any means available, and get the fewer attendees to spend more. With new blockbusters set to emerge—summer movie season is just a few months away—this may be the catalyst that helps get AMC back up and running.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AMC Stock a Buy or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on AMC stock based on one Buy, three Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 65.45% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amc\">loss in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amc/forecast\">average AMC price target</a> of $1.78 per share implies 54.78% upside potential.</p>",

At the same time, Autodesk has finished a major overhaul of its sales strategy, known as its go-to-market optimization.

Despite these headwinds, Autodesk continues to invest heavily in artificial intelligence by using its specialized industry data and software expertise to build advanced <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools designed for engineering and construction workflows. As a result, J.P. Morgan reaffirmed its Buy rating on the stock and raised its price target to $336 from $319.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, BTIG's <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/nick-altmann\">Nick Altmann</a> kept his Buy rating but lowered their price target to $300 from $365, due to the conservative outlook. Still, they highlighted that recent results were stronger than expected, with revenue growth of 14% and billings growth of 32%, both well above their forecasts. This performance was supported by strong contract renewals and steady sales patterns, as well as solid growth in future contracted revenue. Looking ahead, Autodesk expects Fiscal 2027 revenue of about $8.1 billion to $8.17 billion, which equates to roughly 12% to 13% growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is ADSK Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on ADSK stock based on 19 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
