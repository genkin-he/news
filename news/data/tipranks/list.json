            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Earnings per share came in at $1.05, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/earnings\">far below analyst expectations</a> due to a one-time charge, while revenue hit $51.2 billion, up 26% from last year and ahead of estimates. But investors focused on what's next, and the numbers show a company spending faster than it's growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI Expansion Drives Expenses Higher</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's operating margin fell to 40%, down from 43% last year, as costs tied to its AI push surged. Research and development expenses jumped 28%, largely due to aggressive hiring across Meta's <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> unit.</p>\n<p>The company also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast once again, now expecting around $71 billion, up from $69 billion, with an even steeper increase expected in 2026. This figure cements Meta's position as one of the largest corporate spenders in the world, fueled by a race to expand its AI data centers and in-house compute infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that the spending is already showing results. \"It's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business,\" he said. \"That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more.\"</p>\n<p>Still, investors appear skeptical. Unlike Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, or Google <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, which rent out their AI infrastructure through cloud platforms, Meta's massive data centers are built for its own internal use. This is a strategy that could take longer to pay off.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balance Sheet Pressure Mounts</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's aggressive capital plan is reshaping its financial profile. For the second straight quarter, the company reported more debt, tax, and lease liabilities than cash and short-term investments, deepening its shift toward a more asset-heavy model.</p>\n<p>Even though operational cash flow rose 21% year over year, free cash flow fell by 35% once capital spending was deducted. To offset some of that strain, Meta recently announced a $27 billion joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, moving its Hyperion data center off the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Meta wants AI woven through all its platforms, from ad targeting to its Meta AI assistant. But for now, investors seem to be asking how much longer the company can keep spending at this pace before returns catch up.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite its post-earnings pullback, analysts remain broadly bullish on Meta Platforms (META). Out of 46 Wall Street analysts, 40 rate the stock a Buy and six a Hold, giving it a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average 12-month META price target</a> is $875.90, implying an upside of about 33.7% from the current price.</p>",

The dividend cut has sent FMC stock spiraling downward. The dividend cut was announced by management alongside the company's latest financial results. </p>\n<p>FMC, which specializes in chemicals designed to protect farmers' crops, reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89, which topped the $0.85 forecast among analysts. However, the company announced revenue of $961 million, which was short of the $1.1 billion expected on Wall Street.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Debt and Dividend</strong></h2>\n<p>FMC, which is headquartered in Philadelphia, ended the year's third quarter with $4.5 billion of debt. Management guided for earnings of $850 million in 2025, below Wall Street's projection of $911 million. The combination of slowing growth and hefty debt led to the dramatic divided cut, said senior executives. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fmc-downgraded-to-equal-weight-from-overweight-at-barclays-thefly\">Before the dividend cut</a>, FMC stock was yielding about 6.6%. Going forward, the stock's dividend yield will be about 1.6%, depending on the share price. Even before the dividend cut, FMC stock had struggled, falling 40% on the year, hurt by falling farm income and weak agriculture prices.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is FMC Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>FMC Corp.'s stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 13 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on five Buy and eight Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fmc/forecast\">average FMC price target </a>of $40.08 implies 144% upside from current levels. These ratings might change on news of the dividend cut. </p>",

Nabhan said that while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fiserv-downgraded-to-equal-weight-from-overweight-at-stephens-thefly\">company's baseline has been \"appropriately reset,\"</a> he doesn't expect the stock to re-rate until the second half of 2026, when growth acceleration may become clearer. Stephens added that although recent management and board changes show a \"commitment to change,\" it will likely take several quarters for Fiserv to regain market confidence in its strategy.</p>\n<p>At the same time, J.P. Morgan's <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/tien-tsin-huang\">Tien Tsin Huang</a> at J.P. Morgan cut his <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fiserv-price-target-lowered-to-85-from-155-at-jpmorgan-thefly\">price target from $155 to $85 but kept his Buy rating on FI.</a> The four-star-rated analyst expected the company's Q3 report to be a \"clearing event,\" but says the quarter \"felt more like a necessary washout for Fiserv to cleanse itself, return to its roots, and be a high-quality compounder.\" Meanwhile, he believes that yesterday's selloff likely already accounts for the earnings revisions and lower valuation. Nonetheless, Huang added that Fiserv's new, more realistic targets could help the company deliver clearer and more consistent results going forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Fiserv a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fi\">FI stock</a> has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 22 Wall Street analysts.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Lantheus develops, manufactures, and commercializes diagnostic medical imaging agents and radiopharmaceutical products primarily for the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry.</p>\n<p>The company's claims about possessing reliable information to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/class-action/lantheus-faces-legal-heat-over-misleading-projections\">project revenue and growth of its Pylarify product</a> are at the heart of the current complaint. Pylarify is a radioactive diagnostic agent developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, especially used for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lantheus' Misleading Claims</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, Lantheus and four of its senior executives (the Defendants) repeatedly made false and misleading public statements throughout the Class Period. In particular, they are accused of omitting truthful information about the company's ability to properly evaluate pricing and competition for Pylarify, its most important product in the Radiopharmaceutical Oncology category, from SEC filings and related material.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth/earnings\">earnings call</a> held at the beginning of the Class Period, the President stated that Pylarify has been very successful, achieving over $1 billion in sales and being the leading PSMA PET imaging agent in the market. The company planned to increase both the number of units sold and overall sales revenue in 2025. Despite competition, Lantheus was confident it would keep the top market position and maintain a higher price compared to competitors.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, during a May 7, 2025, conference call, the company's Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) said Lantheus expects to keep benefiting from Pylarify's unique clinical and commercial advantages to support its clear position as the market leader. They expected to keep expanding their contracts and maintain Pylarify's higher price, despite competition.</p>\n<p>During the same call, the CFO said they were lowering their growth expectations for Pylarify in 2025. Instead of expecting low to mid-single-digit percentage growth, they now expect flat to low single-digit growth for the full year.</p>\n<p>However, subsequent events (detailed below) revealed that the defendants had failed to inform investors that the company did not have an accurate understanding of the pricing and competitive dynamics of Pylarify's market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plaintiffs' Arguments</strong></h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs maintain that the defendants deceived investors by lying and withholding critical information about the company's business and prospects during the Class Period. Importantly, the defendants failed to accurately evaluate Pylarify's pricing and competition in forecasting the company's revenue and growth estimates.</p>\n<p>After partial disclosures in May, the information became clear on August 6, 2025, when Lantheus released <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/lantheus-holdings-reports-q2-2025-results-and-strategic-moves\">disappointing results for the second quarter</a> of fiscal 2025 and slashed growth expectations for fiscal 2025.</p>\n<p>In Q2, Pylarify revenue fell 8.3% year-over-year due to losses from ongoing competition, impacting Pylarify's pricing dynamics. The company also lowered its growth expectations significantly for Pylarify. Following the news, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth/historical-prices\">LNTH stock fell 28.6%</a>.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the defendants failed to inform investors that the company did not have an accurate understanding of the pricing and competitive dynamics of Pylarify's market. Due to these issues, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth\">LNTH stock has lost 37.5%</a> year-to-date.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>CERo Therapeutics has had on-and-off trouble maintaining a listing on the Nasdaq. It was granted an extension in January 2025 to give it time to address the issue, and it did so. However, it ran into trouble again in August when it sold marketable securities at a substantial discount. This caught the interest of a Nasdaq panel, which sent another delisting notice to the company.</p>\n<p>While CERo Therapeutics intends to appeal the delisting decision, trading of the company's shares is set to be suspended tomorrow. CERo Therapeutics also noted that it's in the process of preparing for a switch from the Nasdaq to an OTC market listing. However, the company said that there's no guarantee it will succeed and warned such a move could negatively affect the price of CERO stock.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CERo Therapeutics Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cero\">CERo Therapeutics stock was down 81.28% in pre-market trading on Thursday</a>, following a 4.79% fall on Wednesday. This extends a 98.51% drop year-to-date and a 90.96% decline over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>Today's delisting news resulted in some 5 million shares trading hands, compared to a three-month daily average of about 241,000 units.</p>",
