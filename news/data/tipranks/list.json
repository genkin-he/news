            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>The wall between your <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> wallet and your morning coffee has finally crumbled. Mastercard <a data-ticker=\"MA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">(MA)</a> and MetaMask announced the official U.S. launch of their joint crypto debit card. This rollout is a massive win for the industry because it includes New York, a state known for having the toughest crypto rules in the country. Now, almost any American can use their digital assets to pay for groceries, gas, or even a Netflix subscription. The news sent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">Mastercard's stock up by 1.2% in early trading on Thursday</a>.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mastercard Integration Provides Global Reach</strong></h2>\n<p>The secret to this card's success is the massive network provided by Mastercard. Instead of trying to build a new payment system from scratch, MetaMask is plugging directly into Mastercard's existing ecosystem. This means you can use the card at over 150 million stores and websites worldwide.</p>\n<p>Partnering with a giant like Mastercard gives crypto the stamp of approval it needs for everyday use. When you tap your phone to pay, the Mastercard network handles the heavy lifting, turning your crypto into dollars in the blink of an eye. This integration allows users to keep their money in the digital world while still being able to spend it in the physical one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-Custody Tech Keeps You in Control</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike traditional crypto cards, which act like a bank account where the company holds your money, the MetaMask Card is different. It uses self-custody technology, which means the tokens stay in your private wallet until the exact second you make a purchase. You are the only person with the keys to your funds.</p>\n<p>Retaining full control of your assets is a huge selling point for people who don't trust big exchanges. Most other cards require you to pre-load money onto an exchange, which can be slow and risky. With this new setup, the money only leaves your wallet when you say so. This creates a much safer and faster experience for everyone involved.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoin Support Reduces Market Risk</strong></h2>\n<p>To make spending more predictable, the card focuses on stablecoins like <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/usdc/forecast\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/usdt-usd\">USDT</a>. Because these tokens are pegged to the U.S. dollar, you don't have to worry about the price of your coffee money crashing while you are standing in line. The card also supports <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">ETH-USD</a></strong>) for those who want to spend their gains directly.</p>\n<p>Focusing on stablecoins <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-stock-reloads-its-crypto-gun-as-zuckerberg-eyes-stablecoin-dominance\">is a smart move for mainstream adoption</a>. It makes crypto feel more like a regular checking account and less like a gamble. As more people move their paychecks into stablecoins to earn higher interest, having a Mastercard that can spend those funds instantly makes the bankless lifestyle a very real option for millions of Americans.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Mastercard Still a Good Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buy and three Hold ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma/forecast\">average 12-month MA price target</a> of $660&nbsp;implies 28.3% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">MA shares have fallen 9.24%</a>.</p>",

The other report reaffirmed earlier reports that although Tesla's robotaxi rides are cheaper than Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> Waymo, they come with longer waiting times and largely have human drivers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>No Robotaxi Test Driving in California?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, records from California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) showed that Tesla logged no miles of autonomous test driving in the state in 2025. Tesla already has an entry-level permit from the state authority, but requires additional permits to operate fully driverless in the state.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Jefferies <a data-ticker=\"JEF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jef\">(JEF)</a> analysts took several rides in Tesla and Waymo's ride-hailing robotaxi services and found that booking a Tesla failed more than 25% of the time. This is even though Tesla rides turned out to be cheaper due to higher discounts provided.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Eyes Robotaxi Rollout</strong></h2>\n<p>Tesla started to test its robotaxi service in Austin in June last year, rolling out with human safety operators, and later in December kicked off unsupervised and driverless rides in the state. The company later launched a human-supervised service in the San Francisco Bay Area of California in late July and plans to expand to other U.S. states this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has drummed up its robotaxi rollout growth strategy, recently moving <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/elon-musk-ends-fsd-buyouts-what-the-subscription-push-means-for-tesla-stock\">to a monthly subscription model</a> for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. This comes as the automaker's vehicle sales <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-tsla-jumps-despite-missing-q4-delivery-expectations\">fell for the second consecutive year</a> in 2025. </p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Tesla <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/wrongfully-and-baselessly-tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-gains-as-tesla-pursues-california\">sued California auto authorities</a> over an earlier ruling that concluded that it falsely promoted its vehicles as self-driving. The California DMV had contended that Tesla in 2022 marketed its Autopilot and FSD systems to suggest they were autonomously operated when they required a safety driver.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">Tesla's shares</a>&nbsp;remain a Hold based on analysts' consensus rating.

Adjusted <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trade-desk-reports-q4-eps-59c-consensus-58c-thefly-news\">EPS came in at $0.59, beating the $0.58 consensus</a>. For the full year, TTD posted $2.9 billion in revenue, up 18% from 2024.</p>\n<p>While profitability remained solid, net income margins slipped, falling to 22% in Q4 from 25% a year earlier and declining to 15% for the full year from 16%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wells Fargo Lowers TTD Target on Market Concerns</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the results, analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/alec-brondolo\">Alec Brondolo</a> at Wells Fargo lowered the price target on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/trade-desk-price-target-lowered-to-25-from-42-at-wells-fargo-thefly-news\">TTD stock to $25 from $42</a>, maintaining a Hold rating. He noted that Q4 results came in line with expectations, but Q1 revenue and EBITDA guidance came in 2% and 12% below estimates, respectively.</p>\n<p>While management cited macro weakness in the Auto and CPG sectors, Brondolo noted that ongoing competitive pressures and take-rate concerns likely leave investor worries unresolved.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BofA Cuts TTD Target</strong> <strong>on Weak Margins</strong></h2>\n<p>BofA five-star analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jessica-reif-ehrlich\">Jessica Reif Ehrlich</a> cut the price target on TTD stock from $40 to $20 while maintaining a Sell rating. She noted that guidance for the upcoming quarter points to slower revenue growth and significantly weaker margins, driven by softer demand in key advertising categories and higher planned investments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ratings/underperform-initiation-on-the-trade-desk-slowing-growth-margin-pressure-and-rising-competition-undermine-premium-valuation-ratings-news\">Ehrlich also highlighted rising competition</a> from well-funded rivals, which pressures pricing and makes near-term performance less predictable. While long-term growth drivers remain, she believes reduced earnings estimates, a lower margin profile, and a growth trajectory more in line with adtech peers no longer justify the stock's historical premium.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Trade Desk a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttd\">Trade Desk's stock</a> has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 28 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buys, 13 Holds, and two Sells issued in the last three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ttd/forecast\">average TTD price target</a>&nbsp;of $38.17 implies a 51.7% upside from current levels.</p>",
