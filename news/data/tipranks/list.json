            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Out with the old bodywork and leather interiors, cheerio to the frayed reigns and hello to SDR – (Self Drive Reindeers).</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Revving Stocks</strong></h2>\n<p>If he does, Santa could be laying out the path for his more earth-bound companions as they also consider ditching their old vehicles for new spangled models.</p>\n<p>\"U.S. vehicles have quietly aged in the background,\" said David Russell, Global Head of Market Strategy at online brokerage <a href=\"https://www.tradestation.com/promo/tipranks/?utm_source=TipRanks&amp;utm_medium=articles&amp;utm_campaign=tipranks&amp;utm_content=article_santa-chevy\">TradeStation</a>. \"But now could be a tipping point when Americans need to stop putting bandaids on old cars and just get a new one.\"</p>\n<p>America's recent love affair with used cars dates back to the pandemic. Following the impact of lockdowns on auto supply chains and key components like semi-conductors, there was a drop in the number of new cars being built in the U.S. and a surge in demand for used cars.</p>\n<p>This squeeze led to an increase in prices with, according to car shopping website Edmunds, a 3-year-old used vehicle climbing from around $20,000 in early 2020 to just over $30,000 in early 2025.</p>\n<p>The growth was so strong that commentators warned a 'used car bubble' had been formed. But there are signs that this bubble is finally about to break.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Used Bubble Bursts</strong></h2>\n<p>Figures from Cox Automotive show that nationwide, dealers – both franchised and independent – had a total supply of 2.26 million used vehicles on their lots at the beginning of October. That figure was 3% higher than the 2.21 million in early September and is 10% higher than the same time last year.</p>\n<p>In addition, the average days to turn — the number of days a vehicle sits on a dealer lot before a sale — for used vehicles is now around 38 days, four more days than a year ago.</p>\n<p>Adding to the gloom, used retail sales&nbsp;were at 1.42 million vehicles&nbsp;in September, down from the 1.50 million reported in August.</p>\n<p>Despite <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> uncertainty, in contrast, Cox Automotive has forecast that there will be 1.30 million sales of new cars in October, up from 1.26 million in September.</p>\n<p>That's been helped by sales of EVs which accelerated before the $7,500 tax credits expired at the end of September. Indeed, EV sales volumes in the U.S. hit an all-time high&nbsp;in Q3 2025, reaching 438,487 units sold.</p>\n<p>Other factors behind the new car resurgence include supply chains now back into gear post-Covid and more driver incentives on offer.</p>\n<p>Figures from Edmunds show that value is another factor with the gap between used and new car prices moving to under $17,000 for the first time since 2022.</p>\n<p>The recent Consumer Price Index figures also show the demand trend with used car prices down 0.4% and new cars up 0.2% in September.</p>\n<p>As Russell pointed out America's existing fleet of cars are also beginning to show their age. The average age of vehicles in the US continues to climb, reaching 12.8 years in 2025, according to analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility.</p>\n<p>Despite the resurgence in new car sales, a relatively stable 4.5% scrappage rate means that older vehicles are staying on the road longer, steadily increasing the average age of the fleet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That reduces their value and increases maintenance and wear and tear costs for drivers spluttering from their home down to the shopping mall.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stocks Impact</strong></h2>\n<p>The shift in gears back to new vehicles is expected to keep some U.S. auto stocks humming but leaving others rusting in the side road.</p>\n<p>General Motors <a data-ticker=\"GM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gm\">(GM)</a>, whose brands include Cadillac and GMC, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gm\">is up</a> over 50% in the last 6 months, with Ford <a data-ticker=\"F\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f\">(F)</a> up 32%, and Stellantis <a data-ticker=\"STLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stla\">(STLA)</a>, home to Chrysler and Dodge, up 7%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Hougan argues that the key to success isn't winning over crypto insiders, but <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-wakes-up-from-its-slump-with-eyes-on-3-and-a-new-etf-catalyst\">rather tapping into real investor enthusiasm</a>. \"What drives flows? A group of people that buys the asset — and the XRP Army is incredibly bullish and loves XRP,\" he said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>XRP ETF Filings Multiply as Whales Move In</strong></h2>\n<p>At the moment, there are roughly 20 XRP ETF applications pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That puts it just behind <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> and Solana, each with about 23 filings, and ahead of Ethereum's 16, according to <em>Bloomberg</em> Intelligence's Eric Balchunas.</p>\n<p>Balchunas expects the number of crypto-based ETFs, currently fewer than five, to exceed 200 within the next year, as institutional appetite continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, big investors are already positioning themselves. Data from Santiment shows that whales have scooped up nearly $560 million in XRP over the past week. The buying spree coincides with several <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-price-fumbles-as-lawyer-says-there-seems-to-always-be-unexpected-delays-with-xrp\">XRP ETF approval deadlines approaching at the SEC</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Then There's the XRP Army Factor</strong></h2>\n<p>For Hougan, the XRP story is more about the community. This conviction stems from what he calls the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/how-the-xrp-army-tilted-the-scales-in-ripples-fight-with-the-sec\">\"XRP Army,\" a loyal group of retail investors</a> who have stood by Ripple's token through years of controversy, including its drawn-out legal battle with the SEC.</p>\n<p>\"Flows will dramatically exceed what people are expecting,\" Hougan said. \"<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf\">ETFs</a> die in apathy, and that won't be the case here.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike many altcoins praised for their technical promise but ignored by traders, XRP's power lies in its people. Despite criticism of its centralized structure and corporate ties to Ripple, the token has retained one of crypto's most passionate followings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Critics May Be Missing the Main Point</strong></h2>\n<p>Skeptics often highlight Ripple's control over XRP's supply and its focus on institutional payments rather than decentralization. But Hougan thinks that critique misses the point entirely.</p>\n<p>Institutional adoption, he argues, doesn't require crypto purists' approval; it requires buyers. He points to Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted $107 billion in their first year, despite widespread doubt before launch. And just this week, a new staked Solana ETF posted the biggest debut of any ETF in 2025.</p>\n<p>Both examples, Hougan says, prove that real demand outweighs ideology. At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP is sitting at $2.5219</a>.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Notably, CEO Andy Jassy said that Amazon's AI products are gaining traction across multiple business segments. More precisely, he shared that Rufus—the AI shopping assistant built into Amazon's retail app—could generate $10 billion in extra annual sales. At the same time, AWS Connect, the company's cloud-based call center service, is projected to bring in $1 billion yearly, while Bedrock—Amazon's AI platform for businesses—could eventually match EC2, one of AWS's top services. </p>\n<p>The company also revealed that it's betting big on Anthropic <a data-ticker=\"PC:ANTPQ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/pc:antpq\">(PC:ANTPQ)</a>, the AI startup behind Claude, with an $8 billion investment and custom-built infrastructure. In addition, Amazon stated that its Trainium2 chips are already \"fully subscribed,\" which indicates that there is strong demand for them. Jassy also said that Amazon plans to double AWS' power capacity by 2027.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Amazon a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMZN stock based on 40 Buys assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
