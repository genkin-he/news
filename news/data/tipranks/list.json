            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Alphabet Beats on Both Lines</strong></h2>\n<p>Earnings per share came in at $2.87, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/earnings\">crushing the $2.26 consensus</a> and rising from $2.12 a year ago. Revenue reached $102.3 billion, ahead of the $99.9 billion estimate and up 16% year over year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/financials\">Operating margin landed at 30.5%</a>. If you strip out a $3.5 billion European Commission fine, margin would have been 33.9%, a healthy step up from reported levels. GOOGL shares were up more than 5% around $289 in early trade.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google's Cloud Growth Rebuilds Confidence</strong></h2>\n<p>Google Cloud sales rose 34%, a clear acceleration story the Street wanted to see. Profitability improved too, with operating margin moving to 24% from 17% last year.</p>\n<p>This combination of faster growth and better margin is what investors have been waiting for from Google's AI stack. It suggests the platform is scaling, not just spending.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Capex Plan Grows to Fund AI</strong></h2>\n<p>Management lifted its 2025 capital-spending outlook for AI data centers to $92 billion, up from $85 billion. The company also guided to a \"significant increase\" in 2026.</p>\n<p>Alphabet has the balance-sheet strength to support it. The company sold $12.5 billion in bonds in May and still holds about $98 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google Ads Still Pay the Bills</strong></h2>\n<p>About 85% of revenue still comes from high-margin ads and services. Search and YouTube posted double-digit growth, and Android-related businesses showed strong momentum.</p>\n<p>One soft spot remains Google's third-party ad network, where sales continue to slide amid weaker open-web traffic and antitrust scrutiny. This unit could face changes if the U.S. case advances.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why the \"AI Loser\" Label Is Fading</strong></h2>\n<p>Cloud is winning more deals and throwing off margin. Core ads keep funding the heavy lifting in data centers. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/financials/cash-flow\">Cash flow from operations</a> topped $150 billion over the past 12 months, giving Alphabet fuel to invest without losing financial discipline.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Google is shifting from defending share to monetizing AI across products. The latest quarter shows that turn happening in the numbers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Look Out for Next</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, investors will be watching several key indicators. The first is how cloud bookings and margins trend through 2026 as Alphabet brings new capacity online. The second is whether there are any developments in the U.S. v. Google antitrust case, which could reshape the company's third-party ad network. Finally, attention will stay on free cash flow, especially as capital expenditures ramp up again next year.</p>\n<p>Overall, Alphabet delivered where it mattered most, showing that its cloud business can grow profitably while funding an even larger AI build-out. That's how Google is shedding its image as an AI underdog and positioning itself as a serious front-runner.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Google a Good Stock to Buy Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Alphabet holds a Strong Buy consensus based on 36 analyst ratings, with 28 Buys, eight Holds, and no Sells in the mix. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl/forecast\">average 12-month GOOGL price target</a> is $293.43, suggesting a modest 1.85% upside from the recent close.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Wall Street analysts expect Alibaba to report <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/baba/earnings\">earnings of $0.85 per share for Q2</a> on revenues of $34.36 billion, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/baba/forecast\">TipRanks Analyst Forecasts Page</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analysts Remain Optimistic </strong><strong>Ahead of </strong><strong>BABA's Q2</strong><strong> Earnings</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Ahead of the Q2 earnings report, Top Jefferies analyst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/thomas-chong\">Thomas Chong</a>&nbsp;reiterated a Buy rating on Alibaba stock with a price target of $230, calling the stock a \"Top Pick for 2026.\" The 5-star analyst said Alibaba's growth remains strong, backed by rising demand for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>&nbsp;and cloud services and improving performance in e-commerce and quick commerce.</p>\n<p>The analyst expects cloud revenue to rise about 30% year-over-year, driven by wider use of GPU chips, more <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> training needs, and higher demand for custom data models across industries.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wei-fang\">Mizuho analyst Wei Fang</a> raised his price target on Alibaba to $195 from $159 and kept an Outperform rating on the stock. The firm said its checks show strong delivery order growth in the summer quarter, helped by higher incentives. Mizuho added that Alibaba is likely to gain more share in the banking sector through its full-stack AI tools and open-source strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Alibaba Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Analysts remain highly bullish about Alibaba's stock trajectory. With 19 Buy ratings and two Hold ratings, BABA stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. Also, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/baba/forecast\">average Alibaba price target</a>&nbsp;of $198.21 implies about 12.94% upside potential from current levels.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Earnings per share came in at $1.05, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/earnings\">far below analyst expectations</a> due to a one-time charge, while revenue hit $51.2 billion, up 26% from last year and ahead of estimates. But investors focused on what's next, and the numbers show a company spending faster than it's growing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI Expansion Drives Expenses Higher</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's operating margin fell to 40%, down from 43% last year, as costs tied to its AI push surged. Research and development expenses jumped 28%, largely due to aggressive hiring across Meta's <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> unit.</p>\n<p>The company also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast once again, now expecting around $71 billion, up from $69 billion, with an even steeper increase expected in 2026. This figure cements Meta's position as one of the largest corporate spenders in the world, fueled by a race to expand its AI data centers and in-house compute infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that the spending is already showing results. \"It's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business,\" he said. \"That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more.\"</p>\n<p>Still, investors appear skeptical. Unlike Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, or Google <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a>, which rent out their AI infrastructure through cloud platforms, Meta's massive data centers are built for its own internal use. This is a strategy that could take longer to pay off.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balance Sheet Pressure Mounts</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's aggressive capital plan is reshaping its financial profile. For the second straight quarter, the company reported more debt, tax, and lease liabilities than cash and short-term investments, deepening its shift toward a more asset-heavy model.</p>\n<p>Even though operational cash flow rose 21% year over year, free cash flow fell by 35% once capital spending was deducted. To offset some of that strain, Meta recently announced a $27 billion joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, moving its Hyperion data center off the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Meta wants AI woven through all its platforms, from ad targeting to its Meta AI assistant. But for now, investors seem to be asking how much longer the company can keep spending at this pace before returns catch up.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite its post-earnings pullback, analysts remain broadly bullish on Meta Platforms (META). Out of 46 Wall Street analysts, 40 rate the stock a Buy and six a Hold, giving it a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average 12-month META price target</a> is $875.90, implying an upside of about 33.7% from the current price.</p>",

Pylarify is a radioactive diagnostic agent developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, especially used for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lantheus' Misleading Claims</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, Lantheus and four of its senior executives (the Defendants) repeatedly made false and misleading public statements throughout the Class Period. In particular, they are accused of omitting truthful information about the company's ability to properly evaluate pricing and competition for Pylarify, its most important product in the Radiopharmaceutical Oncology category, from SEC filings and related material.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth/earnings\">earnings call</a> held at the beginning of the Class Period, the President stated that Pylarify has been very successful, achieving over $1 billion in sales and being the leading PSMA PET imaging agent in the market. The company planned to increase both the number of units sold and overall sales revenue in 2025. Despite competition, Lantheus was confident it would keep the top market position and maintain a higher price compared to competitors.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, during a May 7, 2025, conference call, the company's Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) said Lantheus expects to keep benefiting from Pylarify's unique clinical and commercial advantages to support its clear position as the market leader. They expected to keep expanding their contracts and maintain Pylarify's higher price, despite competition.</p>\n<p>During the same call, the CFO said they were lowering their growth expectations for Pylarify in 2025. Instead of expecting low to mid-single-digit percentage growth, they now expect flat to low single-digit growth for the full year.</p>\n<p>However, subsequent events (detailed below) revealed that the defendants had failed to inform investors that the company did not have an accurate understanding of the pricing and competitive dynamics of Pylarify's market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plaintiffs' Arguments</strong></h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs maintain that the defendants deceived investors by lying and withholding critical information about the company's business and prospects during the Class Period. Importantly, the defendants failed to accurately evaluate Pylarify's pricing and competition in forecasting the company's revenue and growth estimates.</p>\n<p>After partial disclosures in May, the information became clear on August 6, 2025, when Lantheus released <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/lantheus-holdings-reports-q2-2025-results-and-strategic-moves\">disappointing results for the second quarter</a> of fiscal 2025 and slashed growth expectations for fiscal 2025.</p>\n<p>In Q2, Pylarify revenue fell 8.3% year-over-year due to losses from ongoing competition, impacting Pylarify's pricing dynamics. The company also lowered its growth expectations significantly for Pylarify. Following the news, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth/historical-prices\">LNTH stock fell 28.6%</a>.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the defendants failed to inform investors that the company did not have an accurate understanding of the pricing and competitive dynamics of Pylarify's market. Due to these issues, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lnth\">LNTH stock has lost 37.5%</a> year-to-date.</p>",
