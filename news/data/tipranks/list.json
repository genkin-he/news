BlackRock's <a data-ticker=\"BLK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/blk\">(BLK)</a> Bitcoin fund, known as IBIT <a data-ticker=\"IBIT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf/ibit\">(IBIT)</a>, was the star of the show, bringing in over $275 million in a single day. While some other funds saw a little bit of money leave, the total amount coming in was much higher than the amount going out.</p>\n<p>Changing the recent trend of withdrawals is a sign that the selling pressure might be fading away. For most of January, investors were nervous and took nearly $3 billion out of these funds. Now, the mood has shifted. On Wednesday alone, more than $500 million flowed into these <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf\">ETFs</a>, marking the busiest day for Bitcoin buying in weeks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Investors Show Strong Hands</strong></h2>\n<p>Many experts were worried that people who bought Bitcoin through ETFs would panic if the price dropped. However, the data suggests the opposite is happening. Analyst Nate Geraci noted that even though Bitcoin has seen a 50% drop from its peak, these new investors are not running away. Instead, they appear to be buying the dip to get more coins at a cheaper price.</p>\n<p>Staying calm during a crash is usually something only long-time Bitcoin fans do. Seeing ETF investors behave the same way suggests that Bitcoin is becoming a more stable part of people's portfolios. Since these funds launched in early 2024, they have absorbed a total of $55 billion, showing that the long-term interest in digital gold is still very strong despite the recent bumpy road.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Altcoin Funds Join the Recovery</strong></h2>\n<p>Additionally, altcoins are also seeing a comeback. Funds that track other cryptocurrencies like <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a> and Solana also turned positive this week. Ethereum ETFs added about $173 million during the same three-day window, while Solana (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd\">SOL-USD</a></strong>) and XRP (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP-USD</a></strong>) funds saw smaller but steady gains.</p>\n<p>Sustaining these fund inflows could be the spark the market needs to stop the price from falling further. Analysts at Bitrue and CoinEx believe that because so many people are buying now, the market is becoming overbought. This means there aren't many sellers left, which often leads to the price stabilizing. While a V-shaped recovery back to record highs might take some time, the $1 billion surge shows that the big money hasn't given up on crypto.</p>\n<p>We used the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-etfs/bitcoin-etfs\">TipRanks ETF Comparison tool</a>&nbsp;to see how Bitcoin ETFs stacked up side-by-side.</p>",

MARA Holdings <a data-ticker=\"MARA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara\">(MARA)</a>, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings, stock skyrocketed by over 16% in a single day. This happened even though the company told everyone it lost $1.71 billion in the last three months of 2025. Usually, a big loss like that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/mara-holdings-price-target-lowered-to-11-from-15-at-rosenblatt-thefly-news\">makes a stock go down</a>. However, the company also shared a new plan to move into the world of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>. Investors liked that news so much that they started buying the stock immediately.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bitcoin Dip Creates a Paper Loss</strong></h2>\n<p>The giant loss did not come from the company spending too much cash on its offices or workers. Instead, it was mostly a paper loss. Because the price of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">BTC-USD</a></strong>) fell from about $114,000 in September to $88,000 in December, MARA Holdings had to lower the value of the 53,822 Bitcoin it owns on its books.</p>\n<p>MARA Holdings reports this loss in order to follow accounting rules. About $1.5 billion of the total loss came from this change in Bitcoin's price. Even though the company mined 6% fewer Bitcoin this quarter, they still have a massive pile of digital coins worth roughly $4.7 billion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Partnership Creates AI Data Centers</strong></h2>\n<p>Investors ignored the bad financial numbers because of a new deal with a group called Starwood Digital Ventures. MARA Holdings is changing from just being a Bitcoin miner into a company that builds digital infrastructure. This partnership will turn some of the company's power sites into big data centers for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and computing.</p>\n<p>The Starwood deal builds enough power capacity to run 750,000 homes in its first phase. CEO Fred Thiel says this plan allows the company to turn power certainty into capacity certainty. This means MARA Holdings will use its access to electricity to help tech companies run their AI tools. This is a very big move that could help the company make more steady money in the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hybrid Model Makes MARA Less Dependent on BTC Prices</strong></h2>\n<p>Wall Street likes this new hybrid plan because it makes the company less dependent on Bitcoin prices. By building these data centers, MARA Holdings can get paid rent by big companies like they are a landlord. At the same time, they can still mine Bitcoin whenever it is profitable to do so.</p>\n<p>This new direction shifts the company toward a market that is growing very fast. Experts think the demand for AI power will grow by over 250% by the year 2030. MARA Holdings owns the land and the power lines already, so they can build these centers faster than other companies. Investors are betting that owning the electricity is just as valuable as owning the Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MARA Holdings a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, MARA stock (MARA) commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on one Buy, six Hold, and five Sell ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara/forecast\">average 12-month MARA price target</a>&nbsp;of $12&nbsp;implies 42% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mara\">MARA shares have fallen 35.6%</a>.</p>",

Fortunately, there are plenty of such signals to choose from.</p>\n<p>One of the best comes from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a>, an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-powered data tool from TipRanks. The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a> gathers and collates the volumes of raw information put out by the markets every day – and puts that information to work. It uses that data to rate every stock in the public markets – and give each one a score, based on a set of factors that is known to correlate with future outperformance. The score is set on a simple, intuitive scale of 1 to 10 – with the 'Perfect 10' indicating stocks that the data says are solid.</p>\n<p>It's a good signal. And when Wall Street's analysts are in-line with it, putting their own 'Buy' recommendations on Perfect 10 stocks, that is a dual signal that should definitely be more compelling to discerning investors.</p>\n<p>So let's do just this. We've used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on two 'Perfect 10' stocks that are also getting high ratings from the analysts. Here they are.</p>\n<p><strong>Accenture</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acn/forecast\"><strong>ACN</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>The first 'Perfect 10' on today's list is Accenture, an IT services and consulting company with a global footprint and a strong bent toward AI and data sciences. Accenture offers business and enterprise clients the services they need to reinvent the ways they remain relevant to customers. From cloud and cybersecurity to AI and data, to marketing, learning, and finance – Accenture can build all of these, and more.</p>\n<p>To do this, Accenture brings together the combined expertise of a large, worldwide workforce, over 780,000 strong, and matches it with proprietary tech platforms and assets, and deep knowledge of the full ecosystem in today's corporate world and its combination of digital tech and business.</p>\n<p>Accenture, with its $121 billion market cap and global reach, has the resources to become the 'reinvention partner of choice' for some of today's biggest business players. The company's partners include such major names as SAP, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, and Salesforce.</p>\n<p>The company has found great success in this approach, and that can be seen from its fiscal 2025 results. In that fiscal year, the last with full data on record, Accenture devoted $3.3 billion to ventures &amp; acquisitions, research &amp; development, and learning &amp; development; in all, it was a large investment in the company's own future. In addition, Accenture brought in $69.7 billion in annual revenue and returned $8.3 billion in cash to shareholders, mainly through its common-stock dividend.</p>\n<p>In December, Accenture reported its results for fiscal 1Q26. The company generated $18.7 billion in revenue, for a 6% year-over-year increase, and beat the forecast by over $210 million. At the bottom line, the company's non-GAAP EPS of $3.94 was up 10% year-over-year and was 22 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley's James Faucette, in covering this stock, notes that most of any headwinds are already accounted for – and that Accenture has a sound path forward. He writes, \"We think 1) market fears around potential Gen AI disruption and 2) DOGE impact are now largely baked into ACN's current valuation at 19x FY27 EPS; further, we think M&amp;A and ecosystem partnerships are growth levers. We believe estimates have likely bottomed and that future revisions are skewed to the upside, driven by lower <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> and more industry clarity on AI investment path. Our growth estimates (FY26: +5%; FY27: +7% ) sit well above consensus growth figures… With a 4.5:1 Bull-Bear skew, we find ACN compelling at current valuation levels (~13% discount to S&amp;P 500).\"</p>\n<p>Faucette's Overweight (Buy) rating comes with a $320 price target that points to a one-year gain for the stock of 54%. (To watch Faucette's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/james-faucette\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Overall, these shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the Street's analyst consensus, based on 17 reviews that include 12 Buys and 5 Holds. The stock is selling for $207.38 right now, and its $293.60 average target price implies a 41.5% upside by this time next year.
