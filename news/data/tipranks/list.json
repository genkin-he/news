            "title": "Analysts Predict Up to 550% Rally for These 2 'Strong Buy' Penny Stocks",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>However, the market's strength at the top doesn't mean opportunity is confined to the trillion-dollar club. In fact, while the giants dominate headlines, some of the most compelling setups can emerge at the opposite end of the market spectrum. Down in the penny-stock arena – where shares trade under $5 – investors can find names with the potential for massive upside.</p>\n<p>Of course, that potential cuts both ways. Low share prices can signal early-stage growth stories with meaningful runway – or companies facing fundamental challenges. Distinguishing between a promising under-the-radar contender and a value trap demands careful due diligence.</p>\n<p>That's where Wall Street analysts earn their stripes, digging into fundamentals, market dynamics, and upcoming catalysts to uncover smaller names with the potential to grow into far more valuable investments.</p>\n<p>With that backdrop, we used TipRanks' database to pinpoint two <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/penny-stocks\">penny stocks</a> earning high conviction from the Street right now. Both hold 'Strong Buy' consensus ratings and offer triple-digit upside potential – including one name with room to rally nearly 550%. Let's take a closer look at why analysts see these picks as primed for gains.</p>\n<p><strong>Acrivon Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acrv/forecast\">ACRV</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first penny stock on our radar today is Acrivon Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech working to take precision oncology to the next level. The company uses its proprietary Generative Phosphoproteomics AP3 platform – essentially a system that measures how cancer cells react to specific drugs – to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit from a given therapy, and its OncoSignature companion diagnostic helps identify which tumors are most likely to respond. In practice, AP3 digs into huge amounts of proteomic data, turns it into structured insights, and taps generative-<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools to help guide targeted drug development and smarter treatment decisions.</p>\n<p>Following this approach, Acrivon has advanced two drug candidates into human clinical trials. Its lead program, ACR-368, is a selective CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor being evaluated in a registrational-intent Phase 2b trial for patients with recurrent, high-grade endometrial cancer who have progressed after platinum chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Early clinical readouts from the trial have been encouraging. Among patients identified as OncoSignature-positive, ACR-368 has delivered substantially higher response rates versus biomarker-negative patients, including durable responses in heavily pretreated disease settings.</p>\n<p>ACR-368 has earned FDA Fast Track designation as a monotherapy in ovarian and endometrial cancer, while Acrivon's companion OncoSignature test for ACR-368 has also received Breakthrough Device status. The company recently added a third arm to the trial, pairing ACR-368 with ultra-low-dose gemcitabine in a broader, biomarker-unselected endometrial cancer group, and it expects to share an update on the confirmatory trial design by year-end.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Acrivon is advancing its second clinical-stage asset, ACR-2316, a dual WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed to destabilize tumor cells by blocking key DNA-damage repair pathways. The therapy is currently moving through an ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy dose-escalation study across solid tumors. Preclinical data showed strong single-agent activity, and early clinical experience has already produced an ongoing confirmed partial response in a patient with endometrial cancer. Acrivon expects to share initial clinical data from this trial by year-end, marking a significant upcoming catalyst for the stock.</p>\n<p>With ACRV shares changing hands at $1.99 and ACR-2316's readout on the horizon, Citizens JMP analyst Silvan Tuerkcan sees a compelling setup for investors.</p>\n<p>\"ACR-2316 data is a significant event for ACRV, which is currently trading at negative EV and has cash runway into 2Q27. A positive emerging profile of ACR-2316 could be worth ~$150M in market cap, in our opinion… We are seeing signals from the competitive landscape that the dual-targeting approach [WEE1 and PKMYT1] has best-in-class potential… The ACR-2316 mechanism is differentiated from the field and has the potential to improve where others have faltered. Acrivon has hinted at a positive tolerability profile, and we will get a better picture of the profile by year-end,\" Tuerkcan noted.</p>\n<p>As for ACR-368, the analyst sees plenty to like there as well, noting: \"The ACR-368 update earlier this year continues to point to an intriguing profile in mEC, where not many options exist. While ORR dropped to 35%, this result, along with the mDoR, is competitive in this setting and especially considering the enrolled population… Acrivon carved out several subgroups that performed particularly well, including biomarker positive patients that had relapsed in the prior line and treatment refractory tumors, which are generally associated with exceedingly poor prognoses.\"</p>\n<p>Putting it all together, Tuerkcan rates ACRV an Outperform (i.e., Buy) with a $13 price target, implying a robust 553% upside from current levels. (To watch Tuerkcan's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acrv/forecast\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The broader Street stance reinforces that confidence. Over the past three months, ACRV has received 6 Buy ratings and just 1 Hold, earning a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target stands at $11.75, pointing to a potential 490% upside over the next year.

Pfizer said in September it had agreed to acquire Metsera – which is aiming to \"reduce the physical, emotional, and economic burdens of obesity,\" for $47.50 per share, or an enterprise value of $4.9 billion, with the potential for another $22.50 per share in payments if certain targets are hit. That would take the total to around $7.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Pfizer has four business days to make a counteroffer, Metsera said, describing Novo's bid as \"superior.\" PFE stock rose 1% today with Novo down 2% and Metsera flat.</p>\n<p>A Pfizer spokesperson told <em>Reuters </em>that it did not have an immediate comment on whether the company would do so. However, it has declared that it is ready to pursue all legal avenues to challenge Novo's bid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump Card</strong></h2>\n<p>That is where President Trump could come in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/courtney-breen\">Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen</a> said the Trump administration is relatively transactional and tends to favor U.S.-oriented or politically savvy companies. In addition, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has particularly close ties to the president.</p>\n<p>\"If there is the potential for any political interference … Pfizer is on the right side of that equation at this point,\" Breen said.</p>\n<p>Bourla has reportedly worked hard to strengthen his relationship with Trump this year, traveling often to the White House and Mar-a-Lago to meet with the president.</p>\n<p>Pfizer was the first to break from other major drugmakers and strike a deal to lower prescription drug prices, with Bourla sharing the stage with Trump at the White House.</p>\n<p>\"Bourla has done a good job at creating a relationship with the administration that will hopefully allow them to get access to the market,\" said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Caution Needed</strong></h2>\n<p>The prize is a big one with analysts forecasting that the weight-loss category is set to grow to $150 billion by the early 2030s.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Harte said that during the Q3 2025 earnings call, Saylor described how Strategy is building what he called a \"credit factory,\" a set of products that let investors choose different levels of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> exposure. The company now has four preferred equity offerings, each giving investors a different balance of risk and return. Harte said this approach effectively builds a Bitcoin yield curve, letting investors pick how much exposure they want.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q3 Earnings Snapshot</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The company posted <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/mstr-earnings-strategys-financial-results-beat-on-top-and-bottom-lines\">better-than-expected Q3 results</a>, driven by strong gains from its Bitcoin holdings and higher revenue from its core business. It reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $8.42 per share</a>, beating estimates of $7.90, on revenue of $128.7 million, which topped forecasts of $116.35 million. Notably, the company now owns about 640,808 BTC, valued at roughly $70.9 billion at current prices, with an average purchase cost of $74,032 per coin.</p>\n<p>During the quarter, Strategy Inc. also increased its dividend rate to 10.5% for its Series A Preferred Stock to attract more investor demand. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor called this an \"inflection point\" for the company, as it continues to expand funding options tied to its growing Bitcoin strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Highlights Growth Potential</strong></h2>\n<p>The analyst noted that Strategy is widening its reach by developing new credit products and introducing international securities. The company's recent B- credit rating from S&amp;P Global will let it tap into the high-yield market, giving it more ways to raise capital beyond equity sales.</p>\n<p>Despite the stock being down 37% year to date, Harte said Strategy's valuation looks attractive, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/statistics\">trading at about 1.3 times its modified net asset value</a>, well below its long-term average of 2.1 times. He said this gives investors a good entry point into one of the purest public Bitcoin plays.</p>\n<p>Harte believes that while Bitcoin's price swings may keep short-term pressure on the stock, Strategy's growing funding options and product lineup make it better positioned for the future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MSTR Stock a&nbsp;Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr\">MSTR stock</a>&nbsp;has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 14 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buys and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mstr/forecast\">average MSTR price target&nbsp;</a>of $532.84 implies a 109.31% upside from current levels.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Wall Street banking heavyweight JPMorgan <a data-ticker=\"JPM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jpm\">(JPM)</a> boosted its price target for Apple's stock, pointing to a \"higher than usual level of confidence from management.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apple Earnings Beat Wall Street</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple on Thursday released its fourth-quarter results, showing <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple\">sales jumped 8% year-over-year</a>, driven by solid performance in its Services segment and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-sees-strongest-iphone-growth-since-the-pandemic\">strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 series</a>. Revenue from this segment climbed 15% year-over-year, elevated by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The California-based company also saw its earnings per share rise 13% YoY to $1.85, beating Wall Street's projected $1.78. Overall revenue slightly surpassed analysts' expectations of $102.17 billion, coming in at $102.5 billion. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here's Why Wall Street Is Turning Bullish on Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings beat, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee\">JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee</a> raised his AAPL price target by more than 12% to $305 per share, up from $290. </p>\n<p>The five-star analyst, who maintained his Overweight rating on the stock, noted that iPhone sales traction has helped Apple polish its outlook for the new fiscal year better than expected. Goldman Sachs also <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-aapl-goldman-sachs-boosts-price-targets-on-these-2-magnificent-7-stocks-after-solid-earnings-beat\">echoed a similar sentiment</a>.</p>\n<p>Following its Q4 performance, Apple now expects to rake in 10% to 12% more in revenue by the second quarter of its Fiscal Year 2026 — that is, between January and March next year. Chatterjee noted that this will be the company's highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. </p>\n<p>Subsequently, JPMorgan \"materially\" lifted its revenue growth forecast for Apple, believing it will continue to sustain its product cycle momentum. </p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wamsi-mohan\">Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan</a> raised his price target from $320 to $325, noting that Apple surprised Wall Street's projections with its 47.2% gross profit margin, even after a $1.1 billion charge from tariffs during the quarter. </p>\n<p>Mohan believes the company will post even better margins in Q2, riding on expected easing of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> conditions and a shift in revenue composition, with a greater proportion emerging from its&nbsp;Services&nbsp;segment. The five-star analyst further pointed to the anticipated introduction of AI-enhanced Siri and the launch of a foldable iPhone smart device by September.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>Will Apple Stock Reach $700 Again?</strong></h2>\n<p>Across the broader Wall Street, however, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">Apple's shares</a> currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, 12 Holds, and three Sells assigned by 35 analysts over the past three months. </p>\n<p>Moreover, at $266.24, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">the AAPL price target</a> suggests about 2% downside risk.</p>",

Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady. Schmid warned that even a 25 bps rate cut wouldn't meaningfully affect labor market conditions but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/are-stocks-overbought-naaim-exposure-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-july-2024\">National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index</a>, which measures the exposure active investment managers have to U.S. stocks, climbed above 100 for the first time since July 2024.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In their latest results, Amazon reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $1.95 per share</a>, beating analysts' estimates of $1.57 per share, as revenue rose to $180.2 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-earnings-amazon-soars-after-aws-growth-helps-smash-eps-estimates\">driven by strong growth in its AWS</a> cloud division and advertising business. Meanwhile, Apple posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.85 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 8% to $102.5 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple\">supported by steady iPhone demand</a> and robust services growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sachs Stays Bullish on Amazon</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $290 from $275. The firm said that while investors may watch consumer spending closely, Amazon's core e-commerce, cloud, and ad businesses remain strong.</p>\n<p>The firm highlighted that AWS should gain from rising demand for AI tools among large companies, while Amazon's retail and delivery network keeps getting more efficient and lowering costs. He added that Amazon's advertising unit is growing quickly with high profit margins, becoming a bigger source of earnings.</p>\n<p>Goldman expects Amazon to keep improving both sales and margins in the coming years, supported by its mix of strong businesses and steady investment in new technology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sees Multi-Year Growth Cycle Ahead for Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman raised the price target on Apple to $320 from $279 and kept a Buy rating. He said Apple's latest results showed solid underlying demand, with the iPhone revenue miss tied to supply limits rather than weaker sales.</p>\n<p>Ng expects Apple to enter a multi-year product upgrade cycle, supported by new AI features, including a more advanced version of Siri and fresh AI partnerships. He also pointed to Apple's plans for new designs, such as a potential foldable iPhone in 2026, and ongoing investment across its product line.</p>\n<p>On the services side, revenue rose 15% year over year, lifted by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne. The firm added that Apple's margins remain strong, helped by a richer product mix and greater use of in-house technology.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Is the Best Tech Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=AAPL&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool</a> to see which of these 'Magnificent 7' names analysts favor more. Amazon holds a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating, supported by a 20.8% upside potential over the next 12 months. In comparison, Apple carries a \"Moderate Buy\" rating, with analysts expecting a modest 2.7% downside from current levels.</p>",
