The company doesn't say what it plans to do with the money raised from this public offering, but it will likely go toward general corporate purposes.</p>\n<p>Investors will note that the Flux Power public offering comes shortly after it regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. This happened on October 20, when the company's market value of listed securities was able to at least reach $35 million.

However, the stock has rallied 131.65% year-to-date and 30.71% over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>The drop in Flux Power's stock price makes sense. The company's public offering has priced its shares well below its closing price yesterday, offering a discount for investors. Additionally, the increased shares being sold dilute the stakes of current shareholders.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The bond plan came a day after Zuckerberg told investors that <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spending will climb sharply next year, with capital costs in 2026 expected to be \"notably higher\" than in 2025. Meta aims to use these funds to boost its AI-driven ads, content tools, and recommendations across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Sees Big Upside in Meta's AI Push</strong></h2>\n<p>Some investors remain cautious about Meta's high spending, but <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\">Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett</a> believes the company is on the right track. Crockett, who recently set a Street-high price target of $1,117 for the stock, said Meta's heavy AI investment could bring faster revenue growth and stronger user engagement.</p>\n<p>He praised Meta's Q3 results as \"great\" and said the company's focus on AI positions it ahead of other tech players in digital advertising.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meta Shares Slide but Finances Stay Strong</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the optimism, Meta shares fell on Thursday after <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-stock-falls-8-despite-strong-financial-results\">the company reported a $16 billion one-time tax charge in its quarterly results</a>. The drop wiped out more than $220 billion in market value and highlighted investor concern over rising expenses and slower short-term profits.</p>\n<p>Even so, Meta's financial health remains solid. The company has strong cash reserves and steady cash flow, giving it room to fund big projects without hurting daily operations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Next for Meta</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's $30 billion bond sale shows it is all-in on AI, even as costs mount. While some investors are uneasy, analysts like Crockett see it as a smart long-term bet. The key question now is whether this record fundraising will help Meta turn its massive AI spending into faster growth — or if these rising bills will test Wall Street's patience once again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 33 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $847.26 per share implies 27.13% upside potential.</p>",

Revenue from this segment climbed 15% year-over-year, elevated by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The California-based company also saw its earnings per share rise 13% YoY to $1.85, beating Wall Street's projected $1.78. Overall revenue slightly surpassed analysts' expectations of $102.17 billion, coming in at $102.5 billion. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here's Why Wall Street Is Turning Bullish on Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Reacting to the earnings beat, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee\">JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee</a> raised his AAPL price target by more than 12% to $305 per share, up from $290. </p>\n<p>The five-star analyst, who maintained his Overweight rating on the stock, noted that iPhone sales traction has helped Apple polish its outlook for the new fiscal year better than expected. Goldman Sachs also <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-aapl-goldman-sachs-boosts-price-targets-on-these-2-magnificent-7-stocks-after-solid-earnings-beat\">echoed a similar sentiment</a>.</p>\n<p>Following its Q4 performance, Apple now expects to rake in 10% to 12% more in revenue by the second quarter of its Fiscal Year 2026 — that is, between January and March next year. Chatterjee noted that this will be the company's highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2022. </p>\n<p>Subsequently, JPMorgan \"materially\" lifted its revenue growth forecast for Apple, believing it will continue to sustain its product cycle momentum. </p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wamsi-mohan\">Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan</a> raised his price target from $320 to $325, noting that Apple surprised Wall Street's projections with its 47.2% gross profit margin, even after a $1.1 billion charge from tariffs during the quarter. </p>\n<p>Mohan believes the company will post even better margins in Q2, riding on expected easing of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> conditions and a shift in revenue composition, with a greater proportion emerging from its&nbsp;Services&nbsp;segment.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/financials\">Profit fell to $7.55 billion</a> from $8.61 billion a year ago as crude prices slid and costs rose. The stock was down about 2% premarket. It is still up 6.6% year to date.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lower Oil Prices Pressure Margins and Cash</strong></h2>\n<p>Declining benchmarks continue to bite. Oil futures are down roughly 16% this year, squeezing upstream margins and tempering cash generation. This explains why a clean EPS beat did not translate into a stronger tape.</p>\n<p>Management highlighted relative performance against that backdrop. As CEO <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/darren-woods\">Darren Woods</a> put it, \"We delivered the highest earnings per share we've had compared to other quarters in a similar oil-price environment.\" Investors, however, are focused on where margins go next if crude stays in the mid-60s.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exxon Ramps Up Production</strong></h2>\n<p>Exxon increases barrels while others pull back. Daily production rose to 4.77 million barrels of oil equivalent from 4.58 million last year, ahead of the 4.7 million many on the Street expected.</p>\n<p>More barrels help offset weak prices, but they also raise the question of capital discipline if the macro softens further. The long-term plan still targets growth to 2030; near-term returns hinge on price, mix, and refining strength.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exxon <strong>Guidance and Peers Shape the Trade</strong></h2>\n<p>Exxon frames expectations around steady execution. Investors will watch any color on fourth-quarter run-rates, refining margins, and capital spend if crude drifts toward $60. These inputs will drive the next move in free cash flow and buybacks.</p>\n<p>Peers matter too. Chevron's <a data-ticker=\"CVX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cvx\">(CVX)</a> stronger print gives the group a reference point, but dispersion is likely as product cracks, chemicals, and project timing differ by company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>What Could Move the Stock Next</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Three things drive the next leg: the path of crude, the pace of cost control, and how much upside refining can still deliver. If oil stabilizes and downstream stays firm, today's weakness can fade. If prices slip again, the market will demand tighter capex and clearer return targets.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Exxon beat on EPS but the revenue miss and softer profit reminded investors that the macro still calls the tune. Shares can find their footing if cash flow trends improve into year-end; until then, the bias stays cautious</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Exxon Mobil a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Wall Street's consensus rating for XOM stock is a Moderate Buy, with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">average analyst price target</a>&nbsp;of $127.58, implying upside potential of 11.2% from current levels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom\">XOM shares have gained about 9.6% year-to-date</a>.</p>",
