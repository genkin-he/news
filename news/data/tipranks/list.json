            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>His post read, \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\" Burry also changed his profile name to \"Cassandra Unchained,\" referencing the Greek mythological figure cursed to make true predictions that no one would believe, a fitting parallel to Burry's history of issuing ignored but accurate warnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Michael Burry Shorting the Market?</strong></h2>\n<p>Burry rose to fame for shorting the U.S. housing market in the mid-2000s, earning billions for himself and his investors when the bubble burst in 2008. He analyzed the risky subprime mortgages and used credit default swaps to bet against the housing market. This contrarian bet was famously depicted in the book and film <em>The Big Short</em>.</p>\n<p>Although Burry has not specified which \"bubble\" he sees now, much speculation points to the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/googl-meta-msft-big-tech-fuels-ai-boom-with-aggressive-capital-spending\">technology sector and its massive bets</a> on <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). His latest comments suggest that he is currently neither shorting nor buying the market, opting instead to remain on the sidelines.</p>\n<p>The surging demand for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> chips has boosted Nvidia's <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-nvda-rockets-to-historic-5-trillion-valuation-on-gtc-strength\">market capitalization to over $5 trillion</a> as of October 29, greater than the GDPs of countries like India, Japan, and Germany. Several experts have warned that an \"AI bubble\" may be forming as companies pour billions into data centers and AI infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bulls vs. Bears</strong></h2>\n<p>Burry's warning comes amid heated <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/billionaire-ray-dalio-warns-that-a-bubble-is-forming-and-explains-why-it-wont-pop-yet\">debate over whether the big AI-driven boom</a> in tech stocks is real progress or just a risky bubble. Critics say inflated valuations could trigger a sharp correction, while others argue that strong revenues and cash flows justify current pricing.</p>\n<p>The three major U.S. indexes are also witnessing massive rallies.

As part of a trade truce reached earlier this week, he agreed to halve the tariff to 10%. Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady.

            "title": "Analysts Predict Up to 550% Rally for These 2 'Strong Buy' Penny Stocks",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>However, the market's strength at the top doesn't mean opportunity is confined to the trillion-dollar club. In fact, while the giants dominate headlines, some of the most compelling setups can emerge at the opposite end of the market spectrum. Down in the penny-stock arena – where shares trade under $5 – investors can find names with the potential for massive upside.</p>\n<p>Of course, that potential cuts both ways. Low share prices can signal early-stage growth stories with meaningful runway – or companies facing fundamental challenges. Distinguishing between a promising under-the-radar contender and a value trap demands careful due diligence.</p>\n<p>That's where Wall Street analysts earn their stripes, digging into fundamentals, market dynamics, and upcoming catalysts to uncover smaller names with the potential to grow into far more valuable investments.</p>\n<p>With that backdrop, we used TipRanks' database to pinpoint two <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/penny-stocks\">penny stocks</a> earning high conviction from the Street right now. Both hold 'Strong Buy' consensus ratings and offer triple-digit upside potential – including one name with room to rally nearly 550%. Let's take a closer look at why analysts see these picks as primed for gains.</p>\n<p><strong>Acrivon Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acrv/forecast\">ACRV</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first penny stock on our radar today is Acrivon Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech working to take precision oncology to the next level. The company uses its proprietary Generative Phosphoproteomics AP3 platform – essentially a system that measures how cancer cells react to specific drugs – to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit from a given therapy, and its OncoSignature companion diagnostic helps identify which tumors are most likely to respond. In practice, AP3 digs into huge amounts of proteomic data, turns it into structured insights, and taps generative-<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools to help guide targeted drug development and smarter treatment decisions.</p>\n<p>Following this approach, Acrivon has advanced two drug candidates into human clinical trials. Its lead program, ACR-368, is a selective CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor being evaluated in a registrational-intent Phase 2b trial for patients with recurrent, high-grade endometrial cancer who have progressed after platinum chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Early clinical readouts from the trial have been encouraging. Among patients identified as OncoSignature-positive, ACR-368 has delivered substantially higher response rates versus biomarker-negative patients, including durable responses in heavily pretreated disease settings.</p>\n<p>ACR-368 has earned FDA Fast Track designation as a monotherapy in ovarian and endometrial cancer, while Acrivon's companion OncoSignature test for ACR-368 has also received Breakthrough Device status. The company recently added a third arm to the trial, pairing ACR-368 with ultra-low-dose gemcitabine in a broader, biomarker-unselected endometrial cancer group, and it expects to share an update on the confirmatory trial design by year-end.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Acrivon is advancing its second clinical-stage asset, ACR-2316, a dual WEE1/PKMYT1 inhibitor designed to destabilize tumor cells by blocking key DNA-damage repair pathways. The therapy is currently moving through an ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy dose-escalation study across solid tumors. Preclinical data showed strong single-agent activity, and early clinical experience has already produced an ongoing confirmed partial response in a patient with endometrial cancer. Acrivon expects to share initial clinical data from this trial by year-end, marking a significant upcoming catalyst for the stock.</p>\n<p>With ACRV shares changing hands at $1.99 and ACR-2316's readout on the horizon, Citizens JMP analyst Silvan Tuerkcan sees a compelling setup for investors.</p>\n<p>\"ACR-2316 data is a significant event for ACRV, which is currently trading at negative EV and has cash runway into 2Q27. A positive emerging profile of ACR-2316 could be worth ~$150M in market cap, in our opinion… We are seeing signals from the competitive landscape that the dual-targeting approach [WEE1 and PKMYT1] has best-in-class potential… The ACR-2316 mechanism is differentiated from the field and has the potential to improve where others have faltered. Acrivon has hinted at a positive tolerability profile, and we will get a better picture of the profile by year-end,\" Tuerkcan noted.</p>\n<p>As for ACR-368, the analyst sees plenty to like there as well, noting: \"The ACR-368 update earlier this year continues to point to an intriguing profile in mEC, where not many options exist. While ORR dropped to 35%, this result, along with the mDoR, is competitive in this setting and especially considering the enrolled population… Acrivon carved out several subgroups that performed particularly well, including biomarker positive patients that had relapsed in the prior line and treatment refractory tumors, which are generally associated with exceedingly poor prognoses.\"</p>\n<p>Putting it all together, Tuerkcan rates ACRV an Outperform (i.e., Buy) with a $13 price target, implying a robust 553% upside from current levels. (To watch Tuerkcan's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/acrv/forecast\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The broader Street stance reinforces that confidence. Over the past three months, ACRV has received 6 Buy ratings and just 1 Hold, earning a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target stands at $11.75, pointing to a potential 490% upside over the next year.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Rolland updated his coverage of AMD stock ahead of the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> company's earnings report next week. The analyst has strong expectations for AMD's earnings, including slightly better results based on stronger server and MI350 sales, as well as improved PC sales. The analyst noted that production of the MI350 series GPU is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>AMD is set to report earnings results for the third quarter of 2025 after markets close on November 4. Wall Street's estimates include <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/earnings\">adjusted EPS of $1.17 alongside revenue of $8.75 billion</a>. Based on its earnings history, AMD is likely to beat these estimates. Its EPS has come in above expectations in six of the past eight quarters, while revenue has done so in seven of the past eight quarters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AMD Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p>AMD stock was up 2.33% on Friday, building on a 115.9% rally year-to-date.

Pfizer said in September it had agreed to acquire Metsera – which is aiming to \"reduce the physical, emotional, and economic burdens of obesity,\" for $47.50 per share, or an enterprise value of $4.9 billion, with the potential for another $22.50 per share in payments if certain targets are hit. That would take the total to around $7.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Pfizer has four business days to make a counteroffer, Metsera said, describing Novo's bid as \"superior.\" PFE stock rose 1% today with Novo down 2% and Metsera flat.</p>\n<p>A Pfizer spokesperson told <em>Reuters </em>that it did not have an immediate comment on whether the company would do so. However, it has declared that it is ready to pursue all legal avenues to challenge Novo's bid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump Card</strong></h2>\n<p>That is where President Trump could come in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/courtney-breen\">Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen</a> said the Trump administration is relatively transactional and tends to favor U.S.-oriented or politically savvy companies. In addition, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has particularly close ties to the president.</p>\n<p>\"If there is the potential for any political interference … Pfizer is on the right side of that equation at this point,\" Breen said.</p>\n<p>Bourla has reportedly worked hard to strengthen his relationship with Trump this year, traveling often to the White House and Mar-a-Lago to meet with the president.</p>\n<p>Pfizer was the first to break from other major drugmakers and strike a deal to lower prescription drug prices, with Bourla sharing the stage with Trump at the White House.</p>\n<p>\"Bourla has done a good job at creating a relationship with the administration that will hopefully allow them to get access to the market,\" said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Caution Needed</strong></h2>\n<p>The prize is a big one with analysts forecasting that the weight-loss category is set to grow to $150 billion by the early 2030s.
