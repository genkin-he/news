            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Four years ago, reports note, Ford shut down a factory in India that was making engine parts. Now, Ford is looking to get that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/this-time-its-windshield-related-ford-stock-nysef-slips-with-latest-multi-recall-burst\">factory back online</a>, and will put the roughly $370 million in question to work in aid of that. Located in Tamil Nadu, the Maraimalai Nagar site is looking to put out over 200,000 engines per year. Interestingly, the engines are not meant to come back to the United States, but it is unclear just where the engines will go.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Ford had an opportunity to set up a different deal back in 2020, when Jim Farley first became CEO of Ford. It was set to make a deal with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd., which in turn would have kept Ford vehicles in play in India. But since India was then considered a \"marginal\" market, like Brazil, Ford decided to pull back and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/moonroof-defect-ford-stock-nysef-slips-on-new-power-company-plan\">keep its capital</a> instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>China Can \"Put Us All Out of Business\"</strong></h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jim Farley is also deeply concerned about the state of the global market, believing the very real possibility that China could put every American automaker out of business. Farley noted that China currently has enough production capacity to cover the entire North American market, which would render Ford and its contemporaries largely extraneous in their own backyard.</p>\n<p>Farley compared this development to the Japanese car market of the 1980s, which was significant, but even back then, much smaller. China's industrial potential is staggering, and this poses what Farley called \"…a completely different level of risk for our industry.\" This in turn prompted several changes at Ford, though it remains to be seen if these will be sufficient.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, nine Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 27.79% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/f/forecast\">average F price target</a> of $12.14 per share implies 7.65% downside risk.</p>",

The company plans to submit its review package for <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/eli-lilly-lly-invests-1-2-billion-in-puerto-rico-manufacturing-plant\">the weight-loss pill</a> to the FDA by year's end and seek an expedited review.</p>\n<p>In June of this year, the FDA launched a new program under which its commissioner can award vouchers to national‑priority drugs, shortening review times to one or two months from about 10 to 12. Priority criteria include innovative medicines, addressing unmet health needs, and boosting domestic U.S. manufacturing. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Production Underway</strong></h2>\n<p>Eli Lilly is <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/lly-earnings-eli-lilly-stock-soars-thanks-to-massive-year-over-year-growth\">gearing up for a big launch</a> of Orforglipron in the second half of 2026. The Indianapolis-based drug maker is already manufacturing the weight-loss pill and storing it at company warehouses, ready to ship as soon as it receives the expected regulatory approval from the FDA.</p>\n<p>The weight-loss pill was shown to help patients lose 12% of their body weight in a late-stage clinical trial, and the company has spent billions of dollars on new U.S. plants and facilities to produce the medication. Orforglipron is expected to be a gamechanger for weight-loss drugs, which are currently taken by injection. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is LLY Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Eli Lilly has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 22 Wall Street analysts.

On Google's Pixel phones the gap was even wider, the study found.</p>\n<p>About one in five Android users described scam protection as highly effective, while iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their phone failed to stop fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p>Security specialists at Counterpoint Research analyzed four recent flagship models, Google's Pixel, Samsung's Galaxy, Motorola's Razr, and Apple's iPhone 17 Pro, to evaluate AI-driven protection.

In fact, the $91 billion spent on stock buybacks in its most recent fiscal year was a deceleration from the $106 billion spent the previous year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hotly Debated</strong></h2>\n<p>Stock buybacks remain a hotly debated subject among investors. Critics claim that share repurchases artificially boost a company's stock, and that the money would be better spent reinvested in the company or providing dividend payments to shareholders. </p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apples-aapl-iphone-air-is-available-for-pre-order-in-china-starting-oct-17\">fans of stock buybacks</a>, including famed investor Warren Buffett, say that there's nothing wrong with companies such as Apple repurchasing their shares. According to Buffett, who owns roughly 2% of Apple and is among the company's largest stockholders, share repurchases give investors a larger percentage ownership in a business without requiring them to spend more money.</p>\n<p>\"If a management wishes to further intensify our ownership by repurchasing shares, we applaud,\" Buffett has said in the past. However, critics would also like to see Apple invest more of its free cash flow, notably in AI.
