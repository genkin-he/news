            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>XRP (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP-USD</a></strong>) is in a tough spot right now. On one hand, the charts show a pattern that usually leads to a 20% price jump. On the other hand, a massive amount of tokens is sitting on exchanges, acting like an anchor that keeps the price from lifting off. As of today, XRP's price is stuck around $1.44, even though more people <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-price-survives-the-scalpel-as-whales-inject-710m-to-save-the-bull-case\">are starting to feel positive about it</a>.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Big Players Move Billion of Tokens</strong></h2>\n<p>The main reason the price feels heavy is <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-etf-inflows-return-as-bulls-defend-1-30-support-level\">because of what the whales are doing</a>. Since the start of 2026, big holders have <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/xrp-price-braces-for-a-deep-dive-toward-0-80-as-whales-unload-millions-on-binance\">moved 3.8 billion XRP onto the Binance exchange</a>. When people see billions of tokens moving onto an exchange, they get nervous because it usually means those tokens are about to be sold.</p>\n<p>This huge supply of tokens has created a glass ceiling at the $1.50 level. Every time the price tries to go higher, it hits this wall of sell orders. Until the market buys up these 3.8 billion tokens, it will be very hard for XRP to move past this point.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Regular Investors Start Buying the Dip</strong></h2>\n<p>While the whales are busy moving tokens to exchanges, another group of investors is doing the opposite. Over the last ten days, about 200 million XRP has actually left Binance. This happens when people buy tokens and move them to their own private wallets for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>Choosing to move tokens off exchanges is usually a sign that people believe the price will go up later. Even though the whales are providing the supply, regular buyers and long-term holders are slowly eating that supply. This is the main reason why the price has been moving sideways for over a week.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Rules and Trade News Create Fear</strong></h2>\n<p>The whole world is a bit nervous right now. On February 24, a new 15% global trade <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> went into effect in the US. This news sent a shockwave through the markets, making people want to hold cash instead of \"risky\" things like <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a>.</p>\n<p>The fear from these trade rules has made it hard for any coin to rally. <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum have also been struggling, which pulls XRP down with them. However, XRP has one thing going for it: a new partnership with GOSH Charity. This deal helps people donate crypto to charity easily, which gives the token a real-world use that some other coins don't have.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP is sitting at $1.4450</a>.</p>",

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>So much is going on, it's hard to know where to start. There are always doomsayers, but recent economic data can't be pleasing them.

Analysts expect a bump when the Q1 numbers come in and the effects of the understated Federal Government shutdown finish rippling through.</p>\n<p>The big news, however, was the Supreme Court decision striking down most of President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a>'s tariff regime. That was the wildcard, and we still don't know how it will affect the game. The President has already indicated that he'll simply levy a global blanket <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> of at least 10%. In the meantime, businesses and importers who have already paid some $170 billion in aggregate tariffs to the US Treasury will be looking to pull some of that back.</p>\n<p>Watching this situation from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus sees reason for optimism – and a place to look for sound stock picks. He writes, \"Many market participants are increasingly recognizing that indeed uncertainty remains at the core of the day-to-day life of the markets as it does in the lives of its participants. Periods of price volatility offer opportunity 'to catch babies thrown out with the bath water'&nbsp;in periods of market downdrafts and present opportunities to respond rather than opt for knee jerk reactions.\"</p>\n<p>The stock analysts at Oppenheimer are running with this thesis – they've picked out beaten-down stocks that appear ready to bounce back in a resilient market environment, and their notes make interesting reading. Let's take a look at two of their choices, and with some help from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks database</a>, we can see whether the general Street consensus aligns with the Oppenheimer analysts' view. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Freshworks</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/frsh/forecast\"><strong>FRSH</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>The first stock on our list of Oppenheimer picks is a software-as-a-service company, Freshworks. Founded in 2010 in India, Freshworks builds and delivers software systems designed to 'uncomplicate' enterprise users' IT and customer service systems. IT and customer service are two of the vital digital functions in any modern enterprise, and Freshworks uses <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and intuitive management to simplify them both.</p>\n<p>That approach has earned the company a solid audience. Freshworks boasts that it has over 74,000 customers in more than 120 countries; that last year, it saved its customers over 1.3 million work-hours in support workflows; and that its AI agents and copilots deliver measurable and significant improvements in productivity times and resolutions.</p>\n<p>Freshworks can claim some major names on its customer list, including S&amp;P Global, Klarna, Forbes, and Bridgestone. The company can also boast solid earnings and a trend of rising revenues. Nevertheless, the stock is down 40.5% year-to-date.</p>\n<p>Much of that loss tracks back to the general threats facing the enterprise software sector. Competition is fierce in the industry, and the emergence of AI, especially agentic and generative AI models, is both a promise and a threat. The promise is that these technologies will open new vistas of opportunity for increased profits; the threat is that current customers will start to adopt the new AI models in-house and reduce the demand for SaaS operators' products.</p>\n<p>For now, though, the company is reporting solid results. In 4Q25, the last period reported, Freshworks' revenue came to $222.7 million, up more than 14% year-over-year and beating the forecast by a $4 million margin. The company's bottom line of $0.14 per share in non-GAAP measures was 3 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>Those strong results form the starting point for Oppenheimer's Brian Schwartz, who writes of the software firm, \"Freshworks delivered a good quarter in 4Q25. The quarter strength was driven by momentum across the EX business and AI products. 4Q25 results also show a record gross margin, and the top-line outperformance flowed through to higher profits. Negatively, 4Q and 2026 guidance show down operating margins as management invests for future growth. Also, 104% constant-currency NRR in 4Q and 105% 1Q guide indicates a meaningful recovery in expansions activity is further out, and may feed an AI bear narrative on Freshworks' seat-based model. Bottom Line: Freshworks is showing good consistency in revenue growth and profit margins, and generating a lot of cash. In our view, the latter supports management instituting greater capital returns to shareholders given low multiples and strong balance sheet.\"</p>\n<p>The analyst goes on to rate FRSH stock as Outperform (Buy), with a $15 price target that indicates room for 106% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Schwartz's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/brian-schwartz\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Right now, Freshworks has 12 recent analyst reviews on file, and the 6-6 split between Buy and Hold gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $7.28, and their $12.89 average price target implies a 77% gain by this time next year.

Platforms such as Amazon Web Services <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> and Google Cloud <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> still dominate the market, but price volatility and capacity limits during peak demand periods have become recurring challenges. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/crwv-vs-nbis-which-ai-infrastructure-stock-will-outperform-in-2026\">surge in GPU demand from AI workloads</a> has only deepened that strain.</p>\n<p>Render addresses this gap by aggregating unused GPU capacity from a global network of node operators and matching it with buyers through a decentralized system. Instead of relying on centralized data centers, the protocol creates a marketplace where underutilized hardware can be activated on demand. Industry research suggests a meaningful share of installed GPU capacity worldwide sits idle for long periods, creating an opening for networks that can mobilize that excess supply efficiently.</p>\n<p>The timing favors this model. The global artificial intelligence market was valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 and is projected to approach the trillion dollar range before the end of the decade, according to Statista. Render has already processed workloads for visual effects studios, gaming firms, and machine learning teams. That blend of creative and technical users supports the case that the network is serving production grade use cases rather than experimental traffic.</p>\n<p>However, in line with other crypto prices in recent months, RNDR-USD has dropped 25% in the past three months. </p>",
