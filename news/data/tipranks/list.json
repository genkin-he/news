            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Tesla is having a bumpy ride on Wall Street this week. On Friday, Tesla stock <a data-ticker=\"TSLA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">(TSLA)</a> slipped in premarket trading, falling to $405.63. While the company has been trying to convince investors that its future belongs to <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> and self-driving cars, the sudden departure of a key leader has created some nerves. The stock has now fallen in three out of the last four weeks, leaving investors wondering if the robo-taxi dream is moving fast enough.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Executive Exit Shakes Tesla's Cybercab Team</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_335d0fecbfa1efb6-115\">The big news of the day was the departure of Victor Nechita, the man in charge of the Cybercab vehicle program.<sup></sup> He had been a central figure in designing Tesla's purpose-built taxi, which has no steering wheel or pedals. His exit comes at a strange time, right as the very first Cybercab finished its journey down the assembly line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-gains-a-tailwind-as-elon-musk-confirms-no-pedals-or-steering-wheel-cybercab-production-starts-in-april\">Leaving the company at such a critical moment</a> is always a red flag for traders. On his LinkedIn profile, Nechita looked back at his time at the company with pride. He wrote, \"Leading the team through the development of Cybercab has been a humbling experience, watching so many dedicated individuals develop a product that has pushed the boundaries of efficiency, safety, and affordability.\" Tesla has not yet said who will take his place as the program moves into its most important phase.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla's Robo-Taxi Expansion Faces Tough Competition</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_335d0fecbfa1efb6-116\">Tesla is in a race to prove that its physical <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> is better than the rest. The company already runs a small taxi service in Austin, Texas, using Model Y cars. By the middle of 2026, Tesla hopes to have its robo-taxis driving passengers in nine different cities. However, they are playing catch-up with Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/private-companies/waymo\">Waymo</a>, which is already operating in 10 cities and has millions of miles of experience.</p>\n<p>Expanding the taxi network is the only way Tesla can justify its massive stock price. Right now, Tesla's stock is about 10 times more expensive than the average company in the S&amp;P 500. Investors are paying a premium because they believe Tesla will eventually make billions of dollars from software and robot rides, rather than just selling cars to individuals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Market Sentiment Weighs on Tesla's AI Dreams</strong></h2>\n<p>Even though Tesla reported strong profits in January, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">the stock has dropped about 5% since then</a>. Many investors are currently worried about how much money it costs to build a self-driving fleet. There are also concerns about new government rules that could slow down how fast Tesla can put these driverless cars on the road in cities like Los Angeles or New York.</p>\n<p>The current stock slump shows that Wall Street is tired of waiting for promises. For Tesla to regain its momentum, it needs to show that the Cybercab can actually handle city traffic without a human pilot. With one of the program's top leaders now gone, the pressure is on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/insiders/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a> to show that the 2026 rollout remains on track.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 44.9%&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">rally in its share price</a>&nbsp;over the past year, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">average TSLA price target</a>&nbsp;of $396.80 per share implies 2.9% downside risk.</p>",

BlackRock's <a data-ticker=\"BLK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/blk\">(BLK)</a> Bitcoin fund, known as IBIT <a data-ticker=\"IBIT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf/ibit\">(IBIT)</a>, was the star of the show, bringing in over $275 million in a single day. While some other funds saw a little bit of money leave, the total amount coming in was much higher than the amount going out.</p>\n<p>Changing the recent trend of withdrawals is a sign that the selling pressure might be fading away. For most of January, investors were nervous and took nearly $3 billion out of these funds. Now, the mood has shifted. On Wednesday alone, more than $500 million flowed into these <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/etf\">ETFs</a>, marking the busiest day for Bitcoin buying in weeks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Investors Show Strong Hands</strong></h2>\n<p>Many experts were worried that people who bought Bitcoin through ETFs would panic if the price dropped. However, the data suggests the opposite is happening. Analyst Nate Geraci noted that even though Bitcoin has seen a 50% drop from its peak, these new investors are not running away. Instead, they appear to be buying the dip to get more coins at a cheaper price.</p>\n<p>Staying calm during a crash is usually something only long-time Bitcoin fans do. Seeing ETF investors behave the same way suggests that Bitcoin is becoming a more stable part of people's portfolios. Since these funds launched in early 2024, they have absorbed a total of $55 billion, showing that the long-term interest in digital gold is still very strong despite the recent bumpy road.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Altcoin Funds Join the Recovery</strong></h2>\n<p>Additionally, altcoins are also seeing a comeback. Funds that track other cryptocurrencies like <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a> and Solana also turned positive this week. Ethereum ETFs added about $173 million during the same three-day window, while Solana (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd\">SOL-USD</a></strong>) and XRP (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd\">XRP-USD</a></strong>) funds saw smaller but steady gains.</p>\n<p>Sustaining these fund inflows could be the spark the market needs to stop the price from falling further. Analysts at Bitrue and CoinEx believe that because so many people are buying now, the market is becoming overbought. This means there aren't many sellers left, which often leads to the price stabilizing. While a V-shaped recovery back to record highs might take some time, the $1 billion surge shows that the big money hasn't given up on crypto.</p>\n<p>We used the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-etfs/bitcoin-etfs\">TipRanks ETF Comparison tool</a>&nbsp;to see how Bitcoin ETFs stacked up side-by-side.</p>",
