            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Several Analysts Weigh In on FI Stock</strong></h2>\n<p>Following the results, four-star-rated analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/harshita-rawat\">Harshita Rawat</a> at Bernstein downgraded her rating on FI stock from Buy to Hold, while trimming <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fiserv-downgraded-to-market-perform-from-outperform-at-bernstein-thefly\">her price target from $205 to $80.</a> She described the magnitude of the Q3 miss as \"hard to explain\" and a \"180-degree turn under the new management.\" Rawat added that she now has reduced confidence in the company's visibility into its own business operations.</p>\n<p>Likewise, analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/charles-nabhan\">Charles Nabhan</a> at Stephens downgraded to Hold and reduced the price target by 50% to $80. Nabhan said that while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fiserv-downgraded-to-equal-weight-from-overweight-at-stephens-thefly\">company's baseline has been \"appropriately reset,\"</a> he doesn't expect the stock to re-rate until the second half of 2026, when growth acceleration may become clearer. Stephens added that although recent management and board changes show a \"commitment to change,\" it will likely take several quarters for Fiserv to regain market confidence in its strategy.</p>\n<p>At the same time, J.P. Morgan's <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/tien-tsin-huang\">Tien Tsin Huang</a> cut his <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/fiserv-price-target-lowered-to-85-from-155-at-jpmorgan-thefly\">price target from $155 to $85 but kept his Buy rating on FI.</a> The four-star-rated analyst expected the company's Q3 report to be a \"clearing event,\" but said the quarter \"felt more like a necessary washout for Fiserv to cleanse itself, return to its roots, and be a high-quality compounder.\" Meanwhile, he believes that yesterday's selloff likely already accounts for the earnings revisions and lower valuation. Nonetheless, Huang added that Fiserv's new, more realistic targets could help the company deliver clearer and more consistent results going forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Fiserv a Good Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to TipRanks, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fi\">FI stock</a> has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 22 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 10 Buys and 12 Holds assigned in the last three months. The&nbsp;average <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fi/forecast\">Fiserv stock price target</a>&nbsp;of $136.64 implies an upside of 97.74% from current levels.</p>\n<p>Year-to-date, FI stock has declined by 67%.</p>",

The company reported a net loss of $485.1 million for this year's third quarter compared to a $106.6 million loss in the same quarter a year earlier. Like other steel producers, Algoma faces a 50% U.S. import <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on its products, a level the industry has called \"unsustainable.\" </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stock Performance</strong></h2>\n<p>\"The U.S. steel market remains largely closed to us, and broader market conditions continue to present headwinds,\" Garcia said in the news release announcing his departure.

However, the government official noted that he expects the resolution on the deal to be reached over the coming weeks and months. </p>\n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Bessent, during an interview on <em>CBS News</em>, said \"all the details\" on the deal were \"ironed out\" in Madrid, Spain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TikTok Transfer Deal Presses On</strong></h2>\n<p>The development comes over a month after <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/president-trump-set-to-sign-tiktok-deal-on-thursday\">signed an executive order </a>declaring the TikTok sale ready, with a new joint venture to run the business valued at $14 billion. </p>\n<p>Trump's executive order outlined a sale structure to meet the national security requirements of the bipartisan 2024 law, which mandated that ByteDance divest its U.S. TikTok operations. Under the law, TikTok faced a nationwide ban in January 2025 due to its failure to complete the sale.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the latest update follows months of uncertainty over the transfer process. Last month, Trump <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-extends-tiktok-ban-again-as-u-s-china-near-deal\">issued his fourth delay of the ban on</a> the platform, pushing it back by another 90 days to December 16.

The new company is to be overseen by a U.S.-dominated board, with one member appointed by the Trump administration. </p>\n<p>Oracle has been confirmed as an investor <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/oracle-stock-orcl-soars-as-it-gets-set-to-take-control-of-crucial-tiktok-algorithm\">to take control of the platform's U.S. user data</a> and recommendation algorithm. Yet questions remain about whether the algorithm for the American market will differ from those used in other regions. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Best Social Media Stock to Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>As the transfer process continues, investors are watching the social media space for opportunities.

            "title": "Netflix (NFLX) Announces 10-for-1 Stock Split",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The company said that <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/netflix-announces-ten-for-one-stock-split\">existing shareholders</a> as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis Nov. 17. Netflix shares added more than 2% in after-hours trading on news of the stock split. Shares currently trade at $1,125, having gained more than 40% this year.</p>\n<p>Netflix is currently one of only 10 stocks in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index that has a price above $1,000. After the split, the stock would trade at $112.50 based on the current share price. In a news release, Netflix said the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/stock-splits/upcoming\">stock split</a> is being executed to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the stock option program.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Previous Splits</strong></h2>\n<p>Netflix has split its stock twice before, in 2004 and again in 2015. A split simply gives each holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change. The company's fundamentals also remain the same. However, a lower share price makes the stock more accessible to investors. </p>\n<p>The stock split comes after Netflix reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/weekend-updates/netflixs-stock-tumbles-amid-earnings-miss-and-strategic-shifts\">disappointing third-quarter financial results</a>. Earlier in October, the company announced earnings per share (EPS) of $5.87, which was well below the $6.97 expected among analysts. Revenue of $11.51 billion matched the consensus expectation on Wall Street. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is NFLX Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Netflix has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 31 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 24 Buy, six Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx/forecast\">average NFLX price target </a>of $1,402.19 implies 28.76% upside from current levels. </p>",
