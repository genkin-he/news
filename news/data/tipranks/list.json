            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Despite recent rumors, PayPal <a data-ticker=\"PYPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl\">(PYPL)</a> is not actively seeking a buyer and is not in <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-paypal-stock-pypl-soars-as-stripe-considers-a-potential-acquisition\">negotiations with Stripe</a> or any other company. Instead, insiders say that the fintech firm has been quietly preparing for months to defend itself against potential activist investors or hostile takeover attempts, according to <em>Semafor</em>. This precautionary move came after a sharp drop in PayPal's stock price raised concerns that the company could become vulnerable. Although <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that Stripe has explored acquiring PayPal, the company has declined to comment on the speculation.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>However, even if Stripe wanted to proceed, pulling off such a deal would be extremely challenging. Because Stripe is privately owned, it cannot use publicly traded shares as currency in a merger, which is how many large acquisitions are financed. Instead, it would need an enormous amount of debt financing to fund a cash purchase, especially if PayPal resisted. Deals of this scale between private buyers and public targets are rare and often require complex financial engineering. </p>\n<p>Still, the strategic logic behind the interest is easy to understand. PayPal controls a large network of users and payment infrastructure that is deeply embedded in global commerce, making it a highly attractive asset for any major fintech player. However, any meaningful discussions would likely have to wait until PayPal's leadership transition settles and the company clarifies its long-term strategy. For now, the firm appears focused on protecting its independence rather than entertaining offers, which caused its stock to drop in today's trading.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PYPL Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on PYPL stock based on five Buys, 26 Holds, and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl/forecast\">average PYPL price target</a> of $51.35 per share implies 13.5% upside potential.</p>",

In a bizarre kind of way, that kind of outstanding performance has become par for the course for the chip giant, and investors' reaction to the print has been a negative one, with shares down 5% in Thursday's trading as of writing. Right now, the market seems reluctant to reward anything <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-related, no matter the strength on display.</p>\n<p>The Street's biggest NVDA bull, however, has no such issues. \"We view the risk/reward positive post a beat/raise quarter,\" said Evercore's Mark Lipacis, an analyst ranked among the top 1% on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Lipacis thinks the stock will outperform eventually as investors gain clarity on two key concerns. The first is whether CapEx growth can continue beyond 2027. In short, Lipacis thinks it can. While many liken today's AI spending to the Internet bubble of 2000, Lipacis points out two crucial distinctions: first, the Internet was a medium \"looking for an app,\" whereas AI is the application in search of compute cycles; second, internet infrastructure spending happened before returns were realized, while AI investment is being funded by actual returns. For instance, AI spending has driven a 35%-90% rise in revenue per employee over the past three years at hyperscalers, reducing costs in both software and headcount. The analyst believes AI-driven savings on $60 trillion in global OpEx are already financing current AI investments. In other words, AI CapEx isn't entirely new spending – it's largely a reallocation, shifting money from enterprise OpEx to the CapEx of hyperscalers, neoclouds, model developers, and enterprises. With current hyperscale CapEx at $1 trillion, less than 2% of global OpEx, Lipacis thinks there is \"more to go.\"</p>\n<p>The second concern is whether demand for AI tokens can sustain its \"parabolic growth.\" Here, too, Lipacis believes it can. Agentic AI represents a \"change in the paradigm\" for compute demand. In prior computing eras, such as PCs or smartphones, demand was constrained by the number of people – 8 billion people can only purchase so many devices. With Agentic AI, multiple autonomous agents can operate simultaneously on behalf of individuals or businesses, interacting with other agents in parallel. This creates virtually unlimited demand for AI tokens. \"Agentic AI has only just started, we expect parabolic growth demand for tokens will continue,\" the 5-star analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Lipacis maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, alongside his Street-high price target of $352, implying the stock will gain 90% in the year ahead. (To watch Lipacis' track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-lipacis\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NVDA stock's Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 36 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. At $272.65, the average target offers 12-month upside of 47%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast</a>)</p>",

When you tap your phone to pay, the Mastercard network handles the heavy lifting, turning your crypto into dollars in the blink of an eye. This integration allows users to keep their money in the digital world while still being able to spend it in the physical one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Self-Custody Tech Keeps You in Control</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike traditional crypto cards, which act like a bank account where the company holds your money, the MetaMask Card is different. It uses self-custody technology, which means the tokens stay in your private wallet until the exact second you make a purchase. You are the only person with the keys to your funds.</p>\n<p>Retaining full control of your assets is a huge selling point for people who don't trust big exchanges. Most other cards require you to pre-load money onto an exchange, which can be slow and risky. With this new setup, the money only leaves your wallet when you say so. This creates a much safer and faster experience for everyone involved.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stablecoin Support Reduces Market Risk</strong></h2>\n<p>To make spending more predictable, the card focuses on stablecoins like <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/usdc/forecast\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/usdt-usd\">USDT</a>. Because these tokens are pegged to the U.S. dollar, you don't have to worry about the price of your coffee money crashing while you are standing in line. The card also supports <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a> (<strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">ETH-USD</a></strong>) for those who want to spend their gains directly.</p>\n<p>Focusing on stablecoins <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-stock-reloads-its-crypto-gun-as-zuckerberg-eyes-stablecoin-dominance\">is a smart move for mainstream adoption</a>. It makes crypto feel more like a regular checking account and less like a gamble. As more people move their paychecks into stablecoins to earn higher interest, having a Mastercard that can spend those funds instantly makes the bankless lifestyle a very real option for millions of Americans.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Mastercard Still a Good Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buy and three Hold ratings. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma/forecast\">average 12-month MA price target</a> of $660&nbsp;implies 28.3% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma\">MA shares have fallen 9.24%</a>.</p>",

The other report reaffirmed earlier reports that although Tesla's robotaxi rides are cheaper than Alphabet's <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> Waymo, they come with longer waiting times and largely have human drivers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>No Robotaxi Test Driving in California?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, records from California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) showed that Tesla logged no miles of autonomous test driving in the state in 2025. Tesla already has an entry-level permit from the state authority, but requires additional permits to operate fully driverless in the state.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Jefferies <a data-ticker=\"JEF\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jef\">(JEF)</a> analysts took several rides in Tesla and Waymo's ride-hailing robotaxi services and found that booking a Tesla failed more than 25% of the time. This is even though Tesla rides turned out to be cheaper due to higher discounts provided.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tesla Eyes Robotaxi Rollout</strong></h2>\n<p>Tesla started to test its robotaxi service in Austin in June last year, rolling out with human safety operators, and later in December kicked off unsupervised and driverless rides in the state. The company later launched a human-supervised service in the San Francisco Bay Area of California in late July and plans to expand to other U.S. states this year.</p>\n<p>Tesla has drummed up its robotaxi rollout growth strategy, recently moving <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/elon-musk-ends-fsd-buyouts-what-the-subscription-push-means-for-tesla-stock\">to a monthly subscription model</a> for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. This comes as the automaker's vehicle sales <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/tesla-stock-tsla-jumps-despite-missing-q4-delivery-expectations\">fell for the second consecutive year</a> in 2025. </p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Tesla <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/wrongfully-and-baselessly-tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-gains-as-tesla-pursues-california\">sued California auto authorities</a> over an earlier ruling that concluded that it falsely promoted its vehicles as self-driving. The California DMV had contended that Tesla in 2022 marketed its Autopilot and FSD systems to suggest they were autonomously operated when they required a safety driver.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Tesla a Buy or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>On Wall Street,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla\">Tesla's shares</a>&nbsp;remain a Hold based on analysts' consensus rating. This breaks down to 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and seven Sells assigned by 30 analysts over the past three months.</p>\n<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">the average TSLA price target</a> of $396.80 implies about 5%&nbsp;downside risk from current trading levels.</p>",
