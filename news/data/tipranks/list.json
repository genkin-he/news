The company is expected to reveal the product at its GTC developer conference next month.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Unlike Nvidia's traditional chips used to train large AI models, the new processor focuses on inference computing. This is the stage when an AI system answers questions, writes code, or carries out tasks after the model has already been built.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NVDA Moves Beyond Training Chips</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia's graphics processors have long dominated the training of large AI models. However, demand is now moving toward running those models in everyday applications. As businesses deploy AI tools for coding, search, and customer service, they need chips that can deliver quick answers while using less power.</p>\n<p>The planned processor is intended to handle those requests more efficiently. Reports indicate OpenAI could become one of the major customers, using the system to improve the speed of its tools.</p>\n<p>The company hinted at this earlier when it said it would purchase \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia as part of a broader agreement. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazons-50b-openai-bet-hinges-on-key-conditions-what-investors-should-know\">OpenAI also signed a separate deal to use Amazon</a> <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> Trainium chips, showing customers are exploring multiple suppliers for AI computing needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia's New Chip Comes amid Rising Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>The new processor also comes as competition in AI hardware rises. Several large tech companies are building alternatives so they do not depend as much on Nvidia's systems. Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-eyes-in-house-chips-to-cut-ai-costs-a-challenge-to-nvidia-nvda\">Amazon have launched their own AI chips</a>, while smaller startups are creating processors made mainly for inference tasks.</p>\n<p>Nvidia still holds a large share of the AI chip market, but the move toward real-time AI services is pushing the company to broaden its product lineup. By launching a chip built for inference, Nvidia is trying to keep its lead as AI shifts from building models to actually running them in apps and services.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Price Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy Consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">average Nvidia price target of $273.38</a>&nbsp;implies 54.29% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA shares have surged nearly 42%.</p>",

The firm said the company is seeking growth outside its burgers and sausages, as demand in that category remains soft.</p>\n<p>Industry data showed that volumes in the U.S. plant-based meat market fell about 7% in the fourth quarter and have been declining for a long period. Beyond Meat's own product volumes dropped roughly 13%, even though the company raised prices by about 5%, indicating customers are sensitive to higher prices.</p>\n<p>The firm added that the shift into nutrition drinks introduces execution risk, since the beverage business relies on different marketing and distribution channels.</p>\n<p>Mizuho also pointed to Beyond Meat's earlier expansion into plant-based jerky in 2022, which failed to gain traction and highlighted how challenging new categories can be for the company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Investor Attention Turns to the March 11 Earnings Report</strong></h2>\n<p>Attention now turns to earnings. With results due March 11, investors will be watching whether demand stabilizes and whether the company can slow its sales declines. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\">Wall Street expects sales to drop about 18% year over year</a>&nbsp;to around $63 million.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\">Analysts also see a loss of about $0.10 per share</a>, narrower than the $0.65 loss a year ago.</p>\n<p>Beyond Meat has yet to show that its core business can return to growth. Unless product volumes improve, analysts believe recent stock gains could be hard to sustain.</p>\n<p>For now, the rally reflects renewed trading interest, but Wall Street's cautious stance suggests the earnings report, rather than the drink launch, will likely determine the stock's next move.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Beyond Meat a Good Stock to Buy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/technical-analysis\">TipRanks' Technical Analysis Tool</a>&nbsp;to assess the outlook for BYND stock.

Lately, the company has been trying to move beyond its core meat products.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why BYND Stock Is Rising</strong></h2>\n<p>The jump followed news that Beyond Meat added four new flavors to its Beyond Immerse sparkling drink line. The drinks include plant protein, fiber, and electrolytes. With the new additions, the lineup now has seven flavors, more than double the original launch.</p>\n<p>Investors see this as an attempt to open a new source of sales. Demand for its meat products has been weak for several quarters, and revenue has been falling. By entering protein drinks, Beyond Meat is trying to build another product line that could support revenue if burger sales remain soft.</p>\n<p>For a stock trading below $5, even small positive news can draw buyers. Traders are betting the company might build a second business outside plant-based meat.</p>\n<p>However, this is still early. The health-drink market is crowded, with many sports and protein beverages already competing for customers.

This also marked the fourth consecutive monthly increase. On a year-over-year basis, PPI climbed 2.9%, topping expectations of 2.6%. The index is closely watched by investors because several of its components flow into the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/pce-price-index-yoy-60\">Personal Consumption Expenditures</a> (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/core-ppi-yoy-144\">Core PPI</a>, which excludes food and energy items, grew 0.8% in January and increased 3.6% from the prior year, marking the fastest annual pace since March 2025. Both figures exceeded estimates of 0.3% and 3.0%, respectively.</p>\n<p>The rise in PPI was fueled by a 0.8% monthly increase in services prices, the largest since July 2025, while goods prices fell 0.3%. More than 20% of the services gain came from a 14.4% surge in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesalers.</p>\n<p>\"Retailers'&nbsp;<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a>&nbsp;bill has come down marginally in the last few months, but they have continued to lift their selling prices,\" wrote Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief U.S. Economist Samuel Tombs in a note to clients.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/tech\">tech sector continues to face weakness</a> as concerns about the impact of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spread across the industry. Nvidia <a data-ticker=\"NVDA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">(NVDA)</a> closed in negative territory for a second consecutive day, despite reporting a standout quarter on Wednesday, while Advanced Micro Devices <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a>, Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, and Salesforce <a data-ticker=\"CRM\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crm\">(CRM)</a> finished lower as well.</p>\n<p>High tech valuations, alongside a weakening dollar, fewer corporate buybacks, and diversification outside of the U.S., led UBS <a data-ticker=\"UBS\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ubs\">(UBS)</a> to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ubs-downgrades-u-s-stock-market-on-dollar-risks-slowing-buybacks\">downgrade American equities to \"benchmark\"</a>&nbsp;in a fully invested global equity portfolio this morning.

Speaking from the White House, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> emphasized that the ideal option would be for the U.S. to hold back on attacking Iran, although the option still remains on the table. \"It'd be nicer if we could do it without [the military], but sometimes you have to do it with,\" he said. The U.S. and Iran held indirect nuclear talks earlier this week, with both sides touting progress.
