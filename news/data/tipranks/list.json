The lower rates arrive just ahead of spring, a period that typically sees increased home-buying activity. \"With a sub-6% rate, we'll get reliable sales growth across the country,\" said Compass Chief Economist Mike Simonsen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Higher Costs May Limit Housing Demand</strong></h2>\n<p>Others aren't so sure that lower rates will lead to higher demand. Whelan Advisory CEO Margaret Whelan notes that consumer sentiment remains subdued alongside a labor market that has shown signs of weakening. In addition, both electricity and home insurance costs have risen, making it more expensive to own a home.</p>\n<p>Economists expect rates to stay in the high 5% to low 6% range for the remainder of the year. Fannie Mae (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fnma\">FNMA</a>) expects an average rate of 6%, while the Mortgage Bankers Association predicts a 6.1% rate.</p>",

Since then, though, it has dropped 60.5% as part of the wider downturn across the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> market.</p>\n<p>The question now is whether its role in facilitating cross-border payments sets the scene for a comeback.</p>\n<p>Investor Anthony Di Pizio is skeptical that will be the case. \"Although XRP's use-case should, in theory, drive long-term upside, it's facing some structural issues that might be difficult to overcome,\" said the investor. \"If history is any guide, these headwinds might fuel even more&nbsp;<em>downside</em>&nbsp;instead.\"</p>\n<p>Cross-border bank transfers are often slow and expensive, largely because institutions rely on different systems, including the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), which can require intermediaries to complete a transaction. Ripple Payments was designed to address that inefficiency by enabling banks to communicate and settle directly, making transfers near-instant and low cost. XRP was introduced as a bridge currency within the network, allowing, for example, a U.S. bank to send XRP instead of dollars to avoid foreign exchange friction. Transaction costs are negligible, typically just 0.00001 tokens, or a fraction of $0.01.</p>\n<p>However, XRP's role is not essential. Ripple Payments also supports fiat transfers, meaning network growth does not automatically translate into higher demand for XRP. \"That's a key reason why it tends to decline sharply during selloffs in the broader crypto markets – its performance is still very much determined by speculative investors,\" Di Pizio explained.</p>\n<p>Banks also tend not to hold bridge currencies, immediately converting them into local currency, and XRP's volatility adds balance sheet risk. That dynamic became more pronounced after Ripple introduced its stablecoin, Ripple USD, in late 2024. With minimal price fluctuation, Ripple USD offers a more stable alternative for institutions, potentially reducing the need for XRP in cross-border transactions.</p>\n<p>Prior to last year's high, XRP's previous peak came in 2018, after which the token lost more than 90% of its value within months and then spent most of the following five years below $1. Di Pizio thinks a \"similar outcome is in progress right now.\"</p>\n<p>Because Ripple Payments does not generate steady, structural demand for XRP, its price remains heavily influenced by speculative trading. Unless the token develops a compelling new use case that drives consistent adoption, it is likely to remain vulnerable to sharp selloffs during periods of broader crypto market uncertainty, limiting its prospects for \"long-term value creation.\"</p>\n<p>With that in mind, Di Pizio's forecast is a downbeat one. \"If we simply follow history, I think XRP will be trading at somewhere between $0.30 and $0.50 five years from now,\" the investor summed up. \"That assumes its 2025 high remains the peak for the foreseeable future, and that the decline reaches a similar magnitude to the 2018 decline with no meaningful recovery thereafter.\" (To watch Di Pizio's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/anthony-di-pizio\">click here</a>)</p>",

Warner executives did not rush to answer that question, but instead presented a look at what was likely to be coming in the near future. One of the big points was the future of the Warner cable channels. From CNN to TNT to Discovery and the rest, Warner declared that the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/graceful-exit-netflix-stock-nasdaqnflx-surges-as-deal-doubts-emerge\">spinoff was going well</a>. In fact, HBO was looking forward to around 10 years' worth of marketing coming up as the Harry Potter series started up.</p>\n<p>Gaming, meanwhile, would take a bit of a backseat for a while, Expensive flops like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> proved to be a problem. Warner's gaming got \"…distracted going after too many IP with too broad a set of studios.\" But the real win would be the film studios, which were poised for a \"stunning\" year going into 2027. Warner managed to land nine major hits in the last 14 months, reports noted.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>But Then The Numbers Hit</strong></h2>\n<p>Even as Warner made it clear its future looked great, its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/wbd-earnings-warner-bros-discovery-stock-slides-as-q4-eps-misses-estimates-revenue-drops\">fourth quarter of 2025</a> figures were a bit of a downer. Warner posted total revenue of $9.46 billion, and boasted 131.6 million subscribers on its HBO Max operations. Yet, despite all that, Warner still managed to post a quarterly loss of $252 million.</p>\n<p>Overall revenue was also down, about 6% against 2024's fourth quarter. Advertising revenue dropped 9%, and half of that loss went to the loss of the NBA broadcasts on its own. Global linear networks dropped another 12%, which makes it abundantly clear why Warner is looking to spin them off, and may also explain why valuing the linear channels has proven to be such a sticking point lately.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is WBD Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on four Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 162.73% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd/forecast\">average WBD price target</a> of $29.66 per share implies 2.9% upside potential.</p>",

Reports suggest that Uptime Assist has cut repair times by between 10% and 15%. This means time and money saved for customers, particularly those who own and manage fleets. Ford dealerships already carry out 35 million repairs a year as it is, so improvements of even seconds will save huge volumes of cumulative man-hours.</p>\n<p>Ford is still pushing toward a goal of same-day <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/very-exciting-plans-for-europe-ford-stock-nysef-lands-fractional-gain-on-passenger-car-plans\">customer repairs</a>. Though it is not there yet, reports note it is closing in. One key feature allows dealerships to call for help from Ford itself, seeking additional technical support or parts ordering assistance. Ford is actively notified if a repair ever takes longer than two days.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Renegades of Frunk</strong></h2>\n<p>Those interested in getting a front trunk—a frunk—for their Mustang Mach-E will need to pay more for the privilege, reports note. A frunk is now an optional feature on the Mach-E, which will cost customers $495 to have included.</p>\n<p>Ford decided to charge for it because, apparently, customers were not particularly interested in this block of empty space. Thus, Ford cut it as a standard feature, allowing it to stay as a paid option. Response to this notion has been mixed, with some wondering why they now need to pay to make a section of space that was really only <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-customer-has-spoken-ford-stock-nysef-slips-as-ford-promises-priority-shift\">usable for storage</a> actually usable for storage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, 12 Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
