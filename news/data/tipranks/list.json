With the deal drama removed, Netflix can return to its core growth formula, focus on pricing power, subscriber growth, and margin expansion, which Yoon says has fueled its long‑term success and should continue to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramount Skydance: </strong>Even if PSKY is paying a premium, Yoon argued that acquiring WBD is still a better strategic path than continuing a \"mediocre standalone trajectory.\" The deal gives PSKY a chance to reshape its future. Yoon does not expect the company to push the price much higher, but he sees strategic logic in the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Warner Bros. Discovery:</strong> WBD shareholders have already seen the stock more than double since PSKY first showed interest in September 2025. PSKY's $31‑per‑share all‑cash offer, backed by financing guarantees and a massive $7 billion termination fee, stands out as clearly superior to Netflix's bid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=WBD&amp;ticker=PSKY&amp;ticker=NFLX\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to line up all three companies in the takeover saga and see which stock analysts favor.

The companies said the new arrangement does not change their long-standing partnership. They added that \"nothing about today's announcements\" alters the previously shared terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has worked with OpenAI since 2019 and provides the Azure cloud systems used to train and operate many of its models. The statement said Microsoft keeps its exclusive license to OpenAI technology and that core services and developer access to the models continue to run on Azure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft Still the Main Partner?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Amazon news drew attention because Microsoft has been OpenAI's main infrastructure and product partner. OpenAI tools are built into Microsoft software and business services, and Azure hosts much of the computing behind the models.</p>\n<p>When OpenAI added another cloud provider, investors questioned whether Microsoft could lose that central role. The companies clarified that OpenAI is adding extra capacity to meet rising demand, not replacing Microsoft.</p>\n<p>They also said partnerships with other cloud providers were always allowed under their agreement and that Microsoft still shares revenue from those deals.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenAI may use more computing providers as usage grows, but Microsoft remains a key part of how the technology reaches customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare Amazon and Microsoft to see which one analysts favor.

This is the stage when an AI system answers questions, writes code, or carries out tasks after the model has already been built.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NVDA Moves Beyond Training Chips</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia's graphics processors have long dominated the training of large AI models. However, demand is now moving toward running those models in everyday applications. As businesses deploy AI tools for coding, search, and customer service, they need chips that can deliver quick answers while using less power.</p>\n<p>The planned processor is intended to handle those requests more efficiently. Reports indicate OpenAI could become one of the major customers, using the system to improve the speed of its tools.</p>\n<p>The company hinted at this earlier when it said it would purchase \"dedicated inference capacity\" from Nvidia as part of a broader agreement. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazons-50b-openai-bet-hinges-on-key-conditions-what-investors-should-know\">OpenAI also signed a separate deal to use Amazon</a> <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a> Trainium chips, showing customers are exploring multiple suppliers for AI computing needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia's New Chip Comes amid Rising Competition</strong></h2>\n<p>The new processor also comes as competition in AI hardware rises. Several large tech companies are building alternatives so they do not depend as much on Nvidia's systems. Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-eyes-in-house-chips-to-cut-ai-costs-a-challenge-to-nvidia-nvda\">Amazon have launched their own AI chips</a>, while smaller startups are creating processors made mainly for inference tasks.</p>\n<p>Nvidia still holds a large share of the AI chip market, but the move toward real-time AI services is pushing the company to broaden its product lineup. By launching a chip built for inference, Nvidia is trying to keep its lead as AI shifts from building models to actually running them in apps and services.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Price Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy Consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">average Nvidia price target of $273.38</a>&nbsp;implies 54.29% upside potential from current levels.

The firm said the company is seeking growth outside its burgers and sausages, as demand in that category remains soft.</p>\n<p>Industry data showed that volumes in the U.S. plant-based meat market fell about 7% in the fourth quarter and have been declining for a long period. Beyond Meat's own product volumes dropped roughly 13%, even though the company raised prices by about 5%, indicating customers are sensitive to higher prices.</p>\n<p>The firm added that the shift into nutrition drinks introduces execution risk, since the beverage business relies on different marketing and distribution channels.</p>\n<p>Mizuho also pointed to Beyond Meat's earlier expansion into plant-based jerky in 2022, which failed to gain traction and highlighted how challenging new categories can be for the company.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Investor Attention Turns to the March 11 Earnings Report</strong></h2>\n<p>Attention now turns to earnings. With results due March 11, investors will be watching whether demand stabilizes and whether the company can slow its sales declines. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\">Wall Street expects sales to drop about 18% year over year</a>&nbsp;to around $63 million.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\">Analysts also see a loss of about $0.10 per share</a>, narrower than the $0.65 loss a year ago.</p>\n<p>Beyond Meat has yet to show that its core business can return to growth. Unless product volumes improve, analysts believe recent stock gains could be hard to sustain.</p>\n<p>For now, the rally reflects renewed trading interest, but Wall Street's cautious stance suggests the earnings report, rather than the drink launch, will likely determine the stock's next move.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Beyond Meat a Good Stock to Buy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/technical-analysis\">TipRanks' Technical Analysis Tool</a>&nbsp;to assess the outlook for BYND stock.

Lately, the company has been trying to move beyond its core meat products.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why BYND Stock Is Rising</strong></h2>\n<p>The jump followed news that Beyond Meat added four new flavors to its Beyond Immerse sparkling drink line. The drinks include plant protein, fiber, and electrolytes. With the new additions, the lineup now has seven flavors, more than double the original launch.</p>\n<p>Investors see this as an attempt to open a new source of sales. Demand for its meat products has been weak for several quarters, and revenue has been falling. By entering protein drinks, Beyond Meat is trying to build another product line that could support revenue if burger sales remain soft.</p>\n<p>For a stock trading below $5, even small positive news can draw buyers. Traders are betting the company might build a second business outside plant-based meat.</p>\n<p>However, this is still early. The health-drink market is crowded, with many sports and protein beverages already competing for customers. So the rally reflects hope more than proof of a real turnaround.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Watch Next: Earnings Ahead</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/financials\">Wall Street expects sales to drop about 18% year over year</a> to around $63 million. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/earnings\">Analysts also see a loss of about $0.10 per share</a>, narrower than the $0.65 loss a year ago.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, options trading points to a sharp reaction to the upcoming results. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/beyond-meat-earnings-ahead-options-traders-brace-for-35-move-in-bynd-stock\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/beyond-meat-earnings-ahead-options-traders-brace-for-35-move-in-bynd-stock\">Traders are pricing in about a 26.44% move</a> in either direction after the report — far larger than the stock's usual earnings swings.</p>\n<p>BYND stock has fallen roughly 78% over the past year due to weak store demand, lower restaurant traffic, and heavy discounting that hurt margins.</p>\n<p>Investors will watch closely for:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>signs retail demand is stabilizing</li>\n<li>restaurant orders improving</li>\n<li>better margins</li>\n<li>cash usage and balance sheet strength</li>\n<li>management's plan to reach break-even</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, the new drink line helped lift sentiment, but the upcoming earnings report will likely decide whether the stock can keep rising or quickly give back the gains.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Beyond Meat a Good Stock to Buy?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bynd/technical-analysis\">TipRanks' Technical Analysis Tool</a>&nbsp;to assess the outlook for BYND stock.
