            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Sees Mixed Outlook</strong></h2>\n<p>Lee noted that Apple's September quarter revenue grew 8% year over year, beating both Jefferies and consensus estimates. While iPhone revenue growth was modest at 6%, other segments like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. Further, gross margin came in at 47.2%, slightly above forecasts, even after accounting for a $1.1 billion <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> impact.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Apple guided for 10% to 12% revenue growth in the December quarter, which is 6% above consensus. However, Lee said that his forecast rose only slightly as he expects a $100 price hike for the iPhone 18 (meant to cover higher costs) might hurt sales and profit margins due to a weaker product mix.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the analyst sees a strong start to Fiscal 2026 and potential upside from a rumored iPhone 18 Fold, which could help offset any downside. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Ahead for AAPL?</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple's biggest hurdles in 2025 stem from rising component costs, slower iPhone volume growth, and global supply chain disruptions. Also, the tech giant faces tough competition, especially as rivals ramp up innovation in foldables, AI, and wearables.</p>\n<p>Further, regulatory pressures and tariff uncertainty remain key concerns. Though <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/apple-aapl-ramps-up-india-production-amid-rising-u-s-india-trade-rift\">Apple has shifted some production to India</a>, recent U.S. tariffs targeting Indian <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> have raised concerns about future cost structures.</p>\n<p>Despite these headwinds, Apple's long-term outlook seems encouraging. Its high-margin Services segment, spanning iCloud, App Store, Apple Music, and more, continues to grow rapidly and helps offset hardware volatility. Moreover, the rumored iPhone 18 Fold could be a game-changer, potentially leading to a new upgrade cycle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AAPL Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, Apple stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buy, 12 Hold, and three Sell recommendations assigned in the last three months. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\">average AAPL price target</a>&nbsp;of $264.07 implies 2.43% downside risk from current levels.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/exxon-stock-xom-slips-despite-earnings-beat-as-lower-oil-prices-bite\">The Texas-based company</a> said that going forward, it will pay a quarterly distribution of $1.03 per share, up 4% from $0.99 currently. After the increase, ExxonMobil will have a dividend yield of 3.60%. The company has increased its dividend for 43 consecutive years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat, a term applied to any company that has paid a higher dividend annually for at least 25 years. </p>\n<p>The dividend increase was announced alongside uneven third-quarter financial results. ExxonMobil posted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.88, which topped the consensus estimate of $1.82. However, revenue of $85.3 billion fell short of Wall Street's forecast of $86.5 billion in sales.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Oil Prices</strong></h2>\n<p>Management at ExxonMobil <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/exxon-mobil-reports-strong-q3-2025-earnings\">blamed the mixed print</a> on falling oil prices, which are currently below $65 a barrel. U.S. oil prices have sunk 16% so far this year. However, despite the weak crude prices, ExxonMobil remains in growth mode. The company's daily production rose to 4.77 million barrels from 4.58 million barrels in last year's third quarter. </p>\n<p>Analysts were quick to note that ExxonMobil's quarterly dividend payouts are far outpacing its free cash flow. In the third quarter, ExxonMobil's distributions (dividends and stock buybacks combined) totaled $9.4 billion while its free cash flow was $7.5 billion. Its net debt grew more than $3 billion in the quarter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is XOM Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of ExxonMobil has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 19 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 12 Buy and seven Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/forecast\">average XOM price target</a> of $127.58 implies 12.30% upside from current levels. </p>",

The analyst has strong expectations for AMD's earnings, including slightly better results based on stronger server and MI350 sales, as well as improved PC sales. The analyst noted that production of the MI350 series GPU is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>AMD is set to report earnings results for the third quarter of 2025 after markets close on November 4. Wall Street's estimates include <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/earnings\">adjusted EPS of $1.17 alongside revenue of $8.75 billion</a>. Based on its earnings history, AMD is likely to beat these estimates. Its EPS has come in above expectations in six of the past eight quarters, while revenue has done so in seven of the past eight quarters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AMD Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p>AMD stock was up 2.33% on Friday, building on a 115.9% rally year-to-date.
