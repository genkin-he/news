The company again noted that changes in the value of its stock portfolio can distort results. In fact, management said that the amount of investment gains or losses in any quarter is \"usually meaningless\" and can produce earnings per share that are \"extremely misleading\" to investors.</p>\n<p>This matters because accounting rules require Berkshire to include unrealized gains and losses from its equity holdings in net income. As a result, swings in market prices can push profits up or down even if the core businesses remain steady.</p>\n<p>When looking at operating earnings, which exclude most investment swings and impairments, Berkshire <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/brk.a/financials/balance-sheet\">earned $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter</a>, down from $14.5 billion a year ago. For the full year, operating earnings were $44.5 billion, compared with $47.4 billion in 2024. That marks a modest decline of about 6%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">",

The key point, however, is that markets appear strong in a time of flux. This has the analysts everywhere looking for solid investments – and the team at Barclays, led by Emily Field, is focusing on US biopharmaceutical firms.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>The Barclays team notes that the US remains the world's largest commercial market in the biopharma and healthcare industry, and that healthcare as a whole remains a popular investment choice when times are uncertain. That said, they are looking at a particular profile: big companies with strong pipelines, and exposure to the tailwinds that are going to boost the industry.</p>\n<p>These tailwinds include aging demographics in the US, a focus on the treatment of chronic diseases, and emerging new technologies in the industry. Taken together, all of this makes the biopharma sector, in the Barclays view, a target-rich environment.</p>\n<p>\"As we take a brand-new look at the U.S. Biopharmaceutical mega cap companies fresh off FY26 guidance and looking into an increasingly uncertain cross-industry backdrop with concerns of generative <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> disruption moving from sector to sector, we see pharma as a place investors will come back home to in 2026… Unlike legacy media, retail, or financial services, it looks like pharma is leveraging AI to compress R&amp;D timelines (McKinsey estimates its implementation could result in a 50% reduction in drug discovery cycles) and reduce clinical trial costs (30% efficiency gains). Therefore, we see Pharma as an 'AI winner'&nbsp;as it accelerates pharma's core competency rather than disrupting its (highly regulated) business model,\" the team wrote.</p>\n<p>Following this, we can look at two of Barclays' recent biopharma picks – Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly/forecast\">NYSE:LLY</a>) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bmy/forecast\">NYSE:BMY</a>), both major players in the U.S. healthcare scene. Let's take a closer look and find out why Barclays likes them.</p>\n<p><strong>Eli Lilly &amp; Company</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we'll look at, Eli Lilly, is described by Barclays as a 'most preferred name' in the sector. It's easy to see why: the company is the largest biopharma operating in the US, with a current market cap of just over $952 billion (LLY stock has broken above $1 trillion in recent months, but not yet consistently; however, the stock is holding near that level). This makes Lilly a mega-cap leader in the field, and the world's most valuable pharmaceutical maker.</p>\n<p>Lilly currently has an extensive pipeline of new drug candidates, with 99 projects undergoing human clinical trials – 39 at Phase 1, 24 at Phase 2, and 36 at Phase 3. In addition, the company reports that it has 5 projects under regulatory review and its most recently approved drug – Kisunla, a treatment for Alzheimer's – got the nod from the FDA in July of 2024.</p>\n<p>The most exciting part of Lilly's portfolio, however, is tirzepatide. This injectable drug has shown applicability as a treatment for multiple conditions. As Mounjaro, it was approved by the FDA in 2022 to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes. This was followed in 2023 by approval as Zepbound, as a treatment for obesity or chronic weight management. And, in December of 2024, the drug was approved by the FDA as the first prescription medication to treat moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity. Zepbound is currently the only prescription medication available for the sleep apnea indication. The drug is dosed as a once-weekly injection.</p>\n<p>In another recent expansion of Lilly's product line, the drug Omvoh, which was approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in 2023 and for the treatment of Crohn's in 2025, recently showed solid results from a Phase 3 clinical trial. In the announcement, made this month, Lilly noted that patients taking Omvoh showed a steroid-free remission from the disease for three years.</p>\n<p>These are important developments in Lilly's portfolio, and show that the company's approved drugs bring some strong advantages to the market: multiple uses, and proven efficacy. This was reflected in the company's most recent earnings report, covering 4Q25, which showed that Mounjaro and Zepbound together were major drivers of revenue growth.</p>\n<p>The top line in the fourth quarter was up 43% year-over-year, to $19.3 billion, and beat the forecast by $1.35 billion. At the bottom line, Lilly's $7.54 non-GAAP EPS was 63 cents per share better than had been expected.</p>\n<p>Field and her team were impressed by tirzepatide, and wrote of Lilly, \"Though the obesity market is sure to see more competitors enter the space, with potential new entrants (such as Amgen, Roche, AstraZeneca) citing the sheer size of the market in terms of patient numbers as likely to drive market segmentation over time and as new therapies are available, having spent a fair amount of time covering this space in our prior role it has become increasingly clear to us that in tirzepatide, LLY has the best product available today, both from a safety and efficacy perspective and amongst competitors. As the market becomes segmented, LLY has likely near-best, if not best-in-class, options among emerging combinations and modalities… Sometimes it's best to keep it simple and stick with a category leader, so whilst valuation is at a significant premium to the broader space, we think with LLY it's worth it…\"</p>\n<p>These comments support the analyst's Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on LLY, while her $1,350 price target implies a one-year gain of 28% for the pharma giant's stock. (To watch Field's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/emily-field\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Lilly gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 21 recent analyst reviews that include 18 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is currently trading for $1,052, and its average target price, at $1,261, indicates room for a ~20% upside potential on the one-year horizon.

The agreement gives OpenAI another large source of computing capacity alongside Microsoft's Azure platform, which quickly raised questions about Microsoft's <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a> role in the partnership.</p><p></p><h3 style=\"text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #1e77f9;\"><a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\">Claim 50% Off TipRanks Premium</a></h3><ul style=\"padding-top: 5px;\"><li>Unlock <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> hedge fund-level data </a> and <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> powerful investing tools </a> for smarter, sharper decisions \n</li><li> Stay ahead of the market with <a data-link=\"article_promo\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/checkout/v2?subscription=tipranks-premium-yearly&amp;llf=rss&amp;coupon=INTRO50P&amp;checkoutPage=checkoutv2\"> the latest news and analysis </a> and maximize your portfolio's potential</li></ul><p></p>\n<p>Soon after the news, Microsoft and OpenAI released a joint statement to address investor concerns. The companies said the new arrangement does not change their long-standing partnership. They added that \"nothing about today's announcements\" alters the previously shared terms of their agreement.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has worked with OpenAI since 2019 and provides the Azure cloud systems used to train and operate many of its models. The statement said Microsoft keeps its exclusive license to OpenAI technology and that core services and developer access to the models continue to run on Azure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Microsoft Still the Main Partner?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Amazon news drew attention because Microsoft has been OpenAI's main infrastructure and product partner. OpenAI tools are built into Microsoft software and business services, and Azure hosts much of the computing behind the models.</p>\n<p>When OpenAI added another cloud provider, investors questioned whether Microsoft could lose that central role. The companies clarified that OpenAI is adding extra capacity to meet rising demand, not replacing Microsoft.</p>\n<p>They also said partnerships with other cloud providers were always allowed under their agreement and that Microsoft still shares revenue from those deals.</p>\n<p>In short, OpenAI may use more computing providers as usage grows, but Microsoft remains a key part of how the technology reaches customers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=MSFT&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to compare Amazon and Microsoft to see which one analysts favor. Below is a screenshot for reference.
