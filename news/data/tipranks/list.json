            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>There is a new offer on the table for Warner from Paramount Skydance: $58 billion in cash and stock. And, should he decide to stay, David Zaslav would take over the top slot of the combined operation. This is likely welcome news for Zaslav, who has been eager to prove that he could turn Warner around after three years of hard times and cost cutting.</p>\n<p>The board, meanwhile, is backing Zaslav, as all offers from Paramount so far have been passed over, and plans to split the company into two parts—Warner Bros., for the studio and streaming arms, and Discovery Global for the linear television components. But the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-smoking-gunn-the-risk-warner-bros-discoverys-nasdaqwbd-sale-does-not-talk-much-about\">sheer amount of content</a> Warner controls, along with the studio and distribution arms, makes it a highly valuable prize for virtually any media operation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Paramount's Plans</strong></h2>\n<p>Reports also emerged about what Paramount has in mind for Warner, should it take over. Interestingly, reports note, Paramount wants to keep \"…most of Warner Bros. Discovery intact if an acquisition happens.\" This is something of a surprise, as it is likely to make an acquisition much tougher to get past regulators. The plans even include the possibility of having CNN share resources with CBS News.</p>\n<p>That makes for a much more dangerous proposition as far as regulation will go. The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration famously took Paramount to task back when it was merely Paramount over its handling of news. The idea that Paramount would be allowed to buy another news organization, particularly one the size of CNN, is staggering. It also seems like the kind of thing several regulatory groups would land on with both feet. Already, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/writers-guild-calls-paramount-wbd-merger-a-disaster-pledges-to-oppose-deal\">Writers Guild of America</a> has announced plans to fight such a merger, should it go through.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is WBD Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on WBD stock based on seven Buys and 10 Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 162.48% <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd\">rally in its share price</a> over the past year, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wbd/forecast\">average WBD price target</a> of $20.27 per share implies 6.76% downside risk.</p>",

However, should the American economy enter a recession, risks related to the U.S. government's debt could accelerate, he said. </p>\n<p>Solomon used his remarks to also <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ma-news-goldman-sachs-gs-on-course-for-1b-acquisition-of-excel-sports-management\">discuss the U.S. dollar</a>. He said that while the greenback has been weakening relative to other currencies, he doesn't see its status as the world's reserve currency ending anytime soon. \"I'm not concerned that there's some fundamental shift,\" he said.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is GS Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>The stock of Goldman Sachs has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 12 Wall Street analysts.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Tech stocks dragged down both indexes after Microsoft <a data-ticker=\"MSFT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft\">(MSFT)</a>, Meta Platforms <a data-ticker=\"META\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta\">(META)</a>, and Alphabet <a data-ticker=\"GOOGL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/googl\">(GOOGL)</a> reported combined spending of about <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/sp-500-stumbles-as-big-tech-hammered-by-ai-spending-fears\">$80 billion on </a><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> infrastructure during the quarter. That's raised concerns about whether such large capital expenditures will pay off.</p>\n<p>META stock fell by 11% after the company raised its 2025 capex guidance to $70 billion from $66 billion. Microsoft said its 2026 capex would exceed its 2025 level, and Alphabet lifted its 2025 capex range to $91-$93 billion from $75-$85 billion. The sharp rise in spending and unclear payoff prospects have fueled worries about a renewed wave of tech exuberance.</p>\n<p>The spending woes overshadowed a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dow-jones-shrugs-off-trumps-truly-great-meeting-with-chinese-president-xi\">one-year trade truce reached between the U.S. and China</a> following a meeting between President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Under the agreement, the U.S. will cut its fentanyl <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall tariff rate to 47% from 57%. In return, China agreed to boost U.S. soybean <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> and lift restrictions on rare earth exports. Trump said he expects the deal to be renegotiated once it expires and confirmed plans to visit China in April 2026, with Xi set to make a U.S. visit \"sometime after that.\"</p>\n<p>\"I had a truly great meeting with President Xi of China,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. \"There is enormous respect between our two Countries, and that will only be enhanced with what just took place.\"</p>\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-orders-nuclear-weapons-testing-to-counter-china-russia\">Trump ordered the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing</a> as a response to match developments by Russia and China, saying the U.S. must test \"on an equal basis.\" The order could break a voluntary nuclear testing moratorium in place since 1992, although the form and scope of the testing remain unclear.</p>\n<p>Finally, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution blocking the national emergency measure that enabled Trump to impose sweeping global tariffs in a 51-47 vote with four Republicans joining Democrats. Despite the vote, the resolution is expected to be symbolic because the House of Representatives and the White House are unlikely to pass it. Earlier this week, the Senate approved similar resolutions to block Trump's tariffs on Brazil and Canada, with a number of Republicans crossing party lines as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">S&amp;P 500</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">SPX</a>) closed with a 0.99% loss, while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">Nasdaq 100</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">NDX</a>) fell by 1.47%.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute </strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic\"><strong>Economic Calendar</strong></a><strong> — filter by impact, country, and more.</strong></p>",
