With the deal drama removed, Netflix can return to its core growth formula, focus on pricing power, subscriber growth, and margin expansion, which Yoon says has fueled its long‑term success and should continue to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Paramount Skydance: </strong>Even if PSKY is paying a premium, Yoon argued that acquiring WBD is still a better strategic path than continuing a \"mediocre standalone trajectory.\" The deal gives PSKY a chance to reshape its future. Yoon does not expect the company to push the price much higher, but he sees strategic logic in the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Warner Bros. Discovery:</strong> WBD shareholders have already seen the stock more than double since PSKY first showed interest in September 2025. PSKY's $31‑per‑share all‑cash offer, backed by financing guarantees and a massive $7 billion termination fee, stands out as clearly superior to Netflix's bid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Stock Is a Better Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=WBD&amp;ticker=PSKY&amp;ticker=NFLX\">TipRanks' Comparison Tool</a>&nbsp;to line up all three companies in the takeover saga and see which stock analysts favor.

This was Samsung's first attempt at mimicking rival Apple's <a data-ticker=\"AAPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl\">(AAPL)</a> incredibly thin smartphone design philosophy for the iPhone Air. Interestingly, super thin smartphones don't appear to appeal to consumers, as the iPhone Air also didn't perform as well as expected.</p>\n<p>Considering the lukewarm reception to the Galaxy S25 Edge, it makes sense that Samsung would consider dropping the line. It would also allow the company to focus on other developments, such as folding smartphones. These have been growing in popularity, though Samsung may have taken the idea a bit too far with its massive Tri-Fold smartphone, which is on the chopping block alongside the Edge line. One fold appears to be enough for consumers, as two folds are too many.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Samsung Stock Movement Today</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ssnlf\">Samsung Electronics stock was up 54.05%</a> after the markets closed yesterday.

While this made the company profitable, it also made the app less enjoyable for free users. As a result, the number of new people joining the app started to slow down in late 2025.<sup></sup></p>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-160\">Management aims to fix this issue by reducing the friction for free learners. Instead of constantly asking users to pay, the company will focus on making the app more fun, which they hope will lead to more people recommending it to friends. Analysts like <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/wyatt-swanson\">Wyatt Swanson</a> from D.A. Davidson believe this is a necessary move, writing that previous efforts to monetize had led to \"disgruntled users and a meaningful negative impact to 'word-of-mouth' marketing.\"</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo's Soft Guidance Worries the Market</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-161\">Investors did not take the news well because Duolingo also lowered its financial outlook for 2026. The company now expects revenue to be lower than what Wall Street analysts previously predicted. Even though the company beat revenue estimates for the final quarter of 2025, the promise of slower growth in 2026 was enough to cause the stock crash.</p>\n<p>Analysts on Wall Street are split on the strategy. While <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ratings/duolingo-buy-rating-reaffirmed-as-valuation-disconnects-from-long-term-growth-and-cash-flow-potential-ratings-news\">some understand the long-term goal</a>, others are punishing the stock for the short-term pain. KeyBanc analyst <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-patterson\">Justin Patterson</a> noted that \"While we believe this is the right long-term move, the near-term effect is clear.\" Because of this uncertainty, multiple firms cut their price targets for the stock by a significant amount.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duolingo Plans to Offer More AI Features</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-162\">To achieve its goals, Duolingo plans to offer more of its <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> features, like the popular \"Video Call with Lily,\" to all users rather than keeping them locked behind a paywall. While this will help attract new users, it also costs more money to run those AI servers, which will reduce the company's profit margins this year.</p>\n<p id=\"p-rc_dda0c70457d096e9-163\">To support the stock price during this transition, the company authorized a $400 million share buyback program. This shows leadership believes the stock is undervalued, but it may not be enough to stop the bleeding if the user growth targets are not met quickly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Duolingo a Good Stock to Buy? </strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, Duolingo stock (DUOL) has a Hold consensus rating based on five Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/duol/forecast\">average 12-month DUOL price target</a>&nbsp;of $139.64&nbsp;implies 48.9% upside potential from current levels.

Instead of focusing only on long-term technology potential, investors now want evidence of real revenue and early commercial use.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quarterly Highlights</strong></h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IonQ Stock</strong></h3>\n<p>IonQ delivered a strong quarter and exceeded expectations by a wide margin. The company reported Q4 revenue of $61.9 million, far above estimates of about $40 million. Its adjusted loss was also smaller than expected.</p>\n<p>Guidance was the bigger driver. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/financials\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/financials\">IonQ forecast first-quarter revenue of $48 million to $51 million</a> and full-year revenue of $225 million to $245 million, both ahead of Wall Street projections. The company also reported full-year 2025 revenue of about $130 million, becoming the first publicly traded quantum computing company to surpass $100 million in annual sales.</p>\n<p>The results suggested customers are beginning to use quantum computing services in real workloads rather than only experimental testing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>D-Wave Quantum Stock</strong></h3>\n<p>D-Wave reported a weaker quarter. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts/financials\">The company posted Q4 revenue of $2.75 million</a>, below estimates of $3.75 million, and a larger-than-expected loss.</p>\n<p>The stock had initially risen in sympathy after IonQ's results but pulled back once D-Wave released its own earnings. Despite the weak quarter, the company announced several developments, including a system sale, defense-related partnerships, and a multi-year quantum computing service agreement with a large corporate customer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sujeeva-de-silva\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sujeeva-de-silva\">Roth Capital analyst Sujeeva De Silva</a> kept a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target, pointing to higher operating expenses after D-Wave's January 2026 agreement to acquire Quantum Circuits, a developer of gate-model quantum hardware. The deal is meant to broaden D-Wave's technology beyond its current annealing systems, though it will raise costs in the near term.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Quantum Computing Stock Looks Stronger?</strong></h2>\n<p>Both companies are early-stage and still unprofitable, but the latest results explain the different market reaction. IonQ's earnings showed clearer revenue growth and reduced uncertainty for investors. D-Wave, meanwhile, highlighted future potential, yet its current revenue remains limited.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=IONQ&amp;ticker=QBTS\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=IONQ&amp;ticker=QBTS\">TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool</a>, analysts still rate QBTS a Strong Buy with an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts/forecast\">average price target of about $41.82</a>, implying significant upside. Meanwhile IonQ carries a Moderate Buy consensus with an <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ionq/forecast\">average price target near $63.82</a>, implying roughly 56% upside from current levels.</p>\n<p>In short, analysts see more valuation upside in D-Wave, but investors are currently favoring IonQ's stronger near-term business momentum.</p>",

Rosenblatt analyst John McPeake seems to think so. \"Yes, Palantir Really Is an 'N of 1'… With a \"rule of 40\" (4Q revenue growth of 70% plus adjusted operating margin of 57%) of 127% and 720bp of rev growth acceleration in 4Q, Palantir is indeed the 'N of 1' that CEO Alex Karp claims,\" the analyst said. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Palantir blends its proprietary infrastructure software with \"best-in-class technology practitioners\" to deliver fast, high-value solutions for enterprises and governments worldwide. McPeake says he has seen the company grow from a loss-making, services-focused startup in the early 2000s into a software leader with repeatable solutions, now generating 84% gross margins and 51% operating margins. \"In enterprise software, we think Palantir will add more free cash flow dollars in 2026 than any software company except for SAP,\" McPeake further added. \"We think Palantir is currently the only stack-agnostic company in technology that can provide an integrated enterprise platform for the rapid deployment of AI.\"</p>\n<p>Palantir's momentum has been driven by close partnerships with governments and defense agencies, along with fast, high-value deployments at major global enterprises, including the U.S. DoD, the CIA, BP, Merck, and General Mills. McPeake's conversations with several customers suggest there is still significant expansion potential within their existing base. The company's \"biggest moat\" lies in the synergy between its \"polymathic engineering team\" and its extensive, mission-critical, battle-tested infrastructure and integration software. With strong demand from both traditional IT modernization and emerging enterprise AI projects, McPeake sees Palantir as well-positioned to achieve double-digit top- and bottom-line growth over the next decade.</p>\n<p>Famously, Palantir's valuation is often mentioned as a turn-off for some. Indeed, a review of the biggest wealth-generating technology companies since 1981 shows that, even with its trailing twelve-month price-to-sales ratio dropping from a peak of 153x to 75x, Palantir remains an outlier.</p>\n<p>But McPeake thinks the valuation is justified. \"If one looks at the companies that have created the most value in technology when they were a similar size to Palantir, none of them was able to grow as fast as Palantir is forecasted to grow in year 8 (equivalent to Palantir's guidance in 2026),\" the analyst explained. Moreover, at least two of those companies – Facebook and Google – relied on major transformative acquisitions midway through that period, while Palantir's growth has been entirely organic.</p>\n<p>Given the stock has declined by 34.4% from last year's highs, McPeake thinks the shares now offer an \"attractive entry point.\" As such, McPeake initiated coverage of PLTR stock with a Buy rating, backed by a $150 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing returns of 10% a year from now. (To watch McPeake's track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-mcpeake\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Street's average target is actually a more exuberant $188.82, a figure that points toward 12-month gains of 39%. On the rating front, based on a mix of 14 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating.
