            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In their latest results, Amazon reported <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/earnings\">Q3 earnings of $1.95 per share</a>, beating analysts' estimates of $1.57 per share, as revenue rose to $180.2 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/amzn-earnings-amazon-soars-after-aws-growth-helps-smash-eps-estimates\">driven by strong growth in its AWS</a> cloud division and advertising business. Meanwhile, Apple posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.85 per share, up 13% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 8% to $102.5 billion, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/aapl-earnings-apple\">supported by steady iPhone demand</a> and robust services growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Stays Bullish on Amazon</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman Sachs kept a Buy rating on the stock and increased the price target to $290 from $275. The firm said that while investors may watch consumer spending closely, Amazon's core e-commerce, cloud, and ad businesses remain strong.</p>\n<p>The firm highlighted that AWS should gain from rising demand for AI tools among large companies, while Amazon's retail and delivery network keeps getting more efficient and lowering costs. He added that Amazon's advertising unit is growing quickly with high profit margins, becoming a bigger source of earnings.</p>\n<p>Goldman expects Amazon to keep improving both sales and margins in the coming years, supported by its mix of strong businesses and steady investment in new technology.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goldman Sees Multi-Year Growth Cycle Ahead for Apple</strong></h2>\n<p>Goldman raised the price target on Apple to $320 from $279 and kept a Buy rating. He said Apple's latest results showed solid underlying demand, with the iPhone revenue miss tied to supply limits rather than weaker sales.</p>\n<p>Ng expects Apple to enter a multi-year product upgrade cycle, supported by new AI features, including a more advanced version of Siri and fresh AI partnerships. He also pointed to Apple's plans for new designs, such as a potential foldable iPhone in 2026, and ongoing investment across its product line.</p>\n<p>On the services side, revenue rose 15% year over year, lifted by higher subscriptions for iCloud+, AppleCare, and AppleOne. Goldman added that Apple's margins remain strong, helped by a richer product mix and greater use of in-house technology.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Is the Best Tech Stock?</strong></h2>\n<p>We used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=AAPL&amp;ticker=AMZN\">TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool</a> to see which of these 'Magnificent 7' names analysts favor more. Amazon holds a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating, supported by a 20.8% upside potential over the next 12 months. In comparison, Apple carries a \"Moderate Buy\" rating, with analysts expecting a modest 2.7% downside from current levels.</p>",

Nvidia's contribution is expected to begin at around $500 million and could rise to $1 billion if the startup reaches its fundraising goals. The reports further stated that Poolside has already secured over $1 billion in commitments, including about $700 million from existing investors.</p>\n<p>Nvidia earlier backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024. Both Poolside and Nvidia declined to comment on the recent reports.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Nvidia's Poolside Move Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia, which is already a major investor in AI startups, continues to diversify its portfolio across multiple sectors. The company's Poolside investment highlights how the world's most valuable company is helping build a growing network of AI startups that could also become key customers. One source said Poolside plans to use part of the new funding to buy Nvidia's GB300 chips.</p>\n<p>For Poolside, the deal supports its ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, the startup announced a partnership with CoreWeave <a data-ticker=\"CRWV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv\">(CRWV)</a> to build <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-teams-up-with-nvidia-backed-poolside-to-build-massive-data-center\">one of the largest data centers in the U.S.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/nvidia-stock-nvda-rockets-to-historic-5-trillion-valuation-on-gtc-strength\">Nvidia briefly crossed the $5 trillion market valuation</a> mark, driven by new partnership announcements at its annual GTC Conference in Washington, D.C. However, on Thursday, NVDA shares fell more than 2% after the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/us-president-trump-china-president-xi-meeting-10232\">Trump–Xi summit</a> failed to deliver any updates on chip sales, dampening investor sentiment. Year-to-date, Nvidia stock remains up over 50%.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">NVDA stock</a>&nbsp;has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on&nbsp;36 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $232.94, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">Nvidia average share price target</a>&nbsp;implies a 14.81% upside potential.</p>",

MSFT expects the growth rate in Fiscal 2026 capex to exceed that in FY25.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>JPMorgan Expects Chip Stocks to Benefit from High AI Spending</strong></h2>\n<p>JPMorgan noted that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have each raised their 2025 capital expenditure budgets and indicated further increases in 2026. These tech giants have reinforced expectations for continued growth in AI-related investments in compute, networking, and storage. JPMorgan stated that the spending updates by tech giants \"corroborate\" its view that cloud and hyperscale data center spending will remain \"structurally elevated\" over the longer term as demand for AI computing continues to rise.</p>\n<p>In particular, analysts at JPMorgan see Nvidia, Broadcom <a data-ticker=\"AVGO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/avgo\">(AVGO)</a>, Marvell Technology <a data-ticker=\"MRVL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mrvl\">(MRVL)</a>, and Advanced Micro Devices <a data-ticker=\"AMD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd\">(AMD)</a> as key beneficiaries from rising demand for AI servers and chips.

Specifically, JPMorgan expects Nvidia to benefit from accelerating GPU (graphics processing unit) demand, while Broadcom and Marvell are well-positioned to address the demand for their custom AI processors developed with Google, Meta Platforms, and Amazon <a data-ticker=\"AMZN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn\">(AMZN)</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, JPMorgan expects AI-related capital expenditures to continue rising through 2027 as major tech companies compete to develop new models and deploy AI tools across their core businesses.</p>\n<p>Other Wall Street brokerages are also upbeat about continued AI spending. For instance, according to <em>CNBC</em>, Citi stated, \"AI party continues – good for&nbsp;AMD,&nbsp;AVGO,&nbsp;MU, and&nbsp;NVDA.\" Analysts at the bank added that the higher capex outlook from Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms supports their view that AI spending remains strong, positively impacting AI-exposed stocks such as AMD (19% of sales), Broadcom (33% of sales), Micron (18% of sales), and Nvidia (88% of sales).</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wall Street's Ratings for AI Chip Stocks</strong></h2>\n<p>Let's look at Wall Street's ratings for some of the chip stocks that are expected to gain from elevated AI spending.</p>\n<p>Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia, Broadcom, Micron, and Western Digital.

He believes that the leasing deal with Core Scientific remains an important part of CoreWeave's AI journey.</p>\n<p>He highlighted that CoreWeave and Core Scientific have close ties with over $10 billion in future lease commitments and about 840 megawatts (MW) of contracted capacity. CoreWeave had aimed to save $500 million annually by 2027 through the merger, mainly by consolidating lease costs, but these savings are now off the table.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CoreWeave Can Capture Meaningful Share Alone</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz sees <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/top-analyst-sees-5-billion-boost-to-coreweaves-crwv-backlog-from-new-ai-deal\">CoreWeave as capturing a meaningful share of the AI cloud</a> provider market, although he had downgraded CRWV to a Hold rating in July due to the \"outsized returns\" since its IPO.</p>\n<p>While the merger rejection closed off opportunities to lower its cost of capital and access infrastructure-focused financing, CoreWeave remains committed to executing on its growth strategy. Moskowitz expects more details on CRWV's financing and power plans when it reports third-quarter earnings on November 10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>M&amp;A Activity and Continued Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>After the merger fell apart, CoreWeave stated that it is staying focused on disciplined execution and building long-term shareholder value, including through selective and strategic acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company also announced the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-steps-out-with-marimo-acquisition-amid-failed-merger-bid\">acquisition of Marimo</a>, which develops an AI-based, interactive development environment for Python designed for AI and data tasks. This is one of several recent smaller acquisitions, and the company is expected to keep pursuing more deals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CoreWeave a Strong Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain divided on CoreWeave's long-term outlook. On TipRanks, CRWV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave price target of $156.87</a>&nbsp;implies 19.7% upside potential from current levels. Since its public listing on March 31, 2025, CRWV stock has surged nearly 253%.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The bond plan came a day after Zuckerberg told investors that <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> spending will climb sharply next year, with capital costs in 2026 expected to be \"notably higher\" than in 2025. Meta aims to use these funds to boost its AI-driven ads, content tools, and recommendations across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Analyst Sees Big Upside in Meta's AI Push</strong></h2>\n<p>Some investors remain cautious about Meta's high spending, but <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/barton-crockett\">Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett</a> believes the company is on the right track. Crockett, who recently set a Street-high price target of $1,117 for the stock, said Meta's heavy AI investment could bring faster revenue growth and stronger user engagement.</p>\n<p>He praised Meta's Q3 results as \"great\" and said the company's focus on AI positions it ahead of other tech players in digital advertising.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Meta Shares Slide but Finances Stay Strong</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the optimism, Meta shares fell 13% on Thursday to $650.25 after <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-earnings-meta-platforms-stock-falls-8-despite-strong-financial-results\">the company reported a $16 billion one-time tax charge in its quarterly results</a>. The drop wiped out more than $220 billion in market value and highlighted investor concern over rising expenses and slower short-term profits.</p>\n<p>Even so, Meta's financial health remains solid. The company has strong cash reserves and steady cash flow, giving it room to fund big projects without hurting daily operations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What's Next for Meta</strong></h2>\n<p>Meta's $30 billion bond sale shows it is all-in on AI, even as costs mount. While some investors are uneasy, analysts like Crockett see it as a smart long-term bet. The key question now is whether this record fundraising will help Meta turn its massive AI spending into faster growth — or if these rising bills will test Wall Street's patience once again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Meta a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on META stock based on 33 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">average META price target</a>&nbsp;of $847.26 per share implies 27.13% upside potential.</p>",
