            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>CoreWeave is an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> cloud computing company specializing in providing cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) infrastructure to AI developers and enterprises. Core Scientific operates data centers for <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">cryptocurrency</a> mining.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strategic Impact from the Rejection</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz noted that both companies will continue operating independently and CoreWeave's commercial partnership with Core Scientific will remain intact. He believes that the leasing deal with Core Scientific remains an important part of CoreWeave's AI journey.</p>\n<p>He highlighted that CoreWeave and Core Scientific have close ties with over $10 billion in future lease commitments and about 840 megawatts (MW) of contracted capacity. CoreWeave had aimed to save $500 million annually by 2027 through the merger, mainly by consolidating lease costs, but these savings are now off the table.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CoreWeave Can Capture Meaningful Share Alone</strong></h2>\n<p>Moskowitz sees <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/top-analyst-sees-5-billion-boost-to-coreweaves-crwv-backlog-from-new-ai-deal\">CoreWeave as capturing a meaningful share of the AI cloud</a> provider market, although he had downgraded CRWV to a Hold rating in July due to the \"outsized returns\" since its IPO.</p>\n<p>While the merger rejection closed off opportunities to lower its cost of capital and access infrastructure-focused financing, CoreWeave remains committed to executing on its growth strategy. Moskowitz expects more details on CRWV's financing and power plans when it reports third-quarter earnings on November 10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>M&amp;A Activity and Continued Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>After the merger fell apart, CoreWeave stated that it is staying focused on disciplined execution and building long-term shareholder value, including through selective and strategic acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company also announced the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-steps-out-with-marimo-acquisition-amid-failed-merger-bid\">acquisition of Marimo</a>, which develops an AI-based, interactive development environment for Python designed for AI and data tasks. This is one of several recent smaller acquisitions, and the company is expected to keep pursuing more deals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is CoreWeave a Strong Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Analysts remain divided on CoreWeave's long-term outlook. On TipRanks, CRWV stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv/forecast\">average CoreWeave price target of $156.87</a>&nbsp;implies 19.7% upside potential from current levels. Since its public listing on March 31, 2025, CRWV stock has surged nearly 253%.</p>",

However, on Thursday, NVDA shares fell more than 2% after the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/us-president-trump-china-president-xi-meeting-10232\">Trump–Xi summit</a> failed to deliver any updates on chip sales, dampening investor sentiment. Year-to-date, Nvidia stock remains up over 50%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Nvidia Bets Big on Poolside</strong></h2>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg News</em>, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/nvidia-to-invest-as-much-as-1b-in-ai-startup-poolside-bloomberg-reports-thefly\">Nvidia's planned investment of up to $1 billion in Poolside</a> could quadruple the startup's valuation, making it one of the largest recent bets in the AI space. For context, Poolside is a French AI company that develops powerful AI models to automate and enhance coding processes, helping users write and optimize software more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Poolside is reportedly in talks to raise $2 billion at a pre-money valuation of $12 billion. Nvidia's contribution is expected to begin at around $500 million and could rise to $1 billion if the startup reaches its fundraising goals. The reports further stated that Poolside has already secured over $1 billion in commitments, including about $700 million from existing investors.</p>\n<p>Nvidia earlier backed Poolside in its $500 million Series B round in October 2024. Both Poolside and Nvidia declined to comment on the recent reports.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Nvidia's Poolside Move Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Nvidia, which is already a major investor in AI startups, continues to diversify its portfolio across multiple sectors. The company's Poolside investment highlights how the world's most valuable company is helping build a growing network of AI startups that could also become key customers. One source said Poolside plans to use part of the new funding to buy Nvidia's GB300 chips.</p>\n<p>For Poolside, the deal supports its ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, the startup announced a partnership with CoreWeave <a data-ticker=\"CRWV\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crwv\">(CRWV)</a> to build <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/coreweave-crwv-teams-up-with-nvidia-backed-poolside-to-build-massive-data-center\">one of the largest data centers in the U.S.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is the Target for Nvidia Stock?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Looking ahead,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda\">NVDA stock</a>&nbsp;has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on&nbsp;36 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $232.94, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">Nvidia average share price target</a>&nbsp;implies a 14.81% upside potential.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>So far, New York Life has invested nearly $2 billion into Affirm's loan pools. Interestingly, this is part of a growing trend in which insurers and private-credit firms are investing more in consumer finance, as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> make these loans more profitable. For instance, Klarna <a data-ticker=\"KLAR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/klar\">(KLAR)</a> has collaborated with Nelnet <a data-ticker=\"NNI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nni\">(NNI)</a> and Pagaya <a data-ticker=\"PGY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pgy\">(PGY)</a>, while PayPal <a data-ticker=\"PYPL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl\">(PYPL)</a> signed a $7 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital <a data-ticker=\"OWL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/owl\">(OWL)</a>.</p>\n<p>However, this new deal with New York Life comes at a time when the lending environment is uncertain. While consumer spending remains steady and late payments are easing, investors are still cautious after recent bankruptcies in subprime auto and consumer credit. Nevertheless, the continued support from major financial partners suggests that many still believe in Affirm's long-term potential, as it has financed over $100 billion in purchases and says that more than 90% of its borrowers return for repeat loans.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is AFRM Stock a Good Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Affirm stock based on 14 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>During the first quarter, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> initiated a 20% <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> on China, citing the country's involvement in exporting the drug. As part of a trade truce reached earlier this week, he agreed to halve the tariff to 10%. Now, he's considering <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-eyes-slashing-chinas-tariff-by-another-10\">completely scrapping the tariff if China cracks down on the flow of fentanyl</a> and the precursor chemicals used to create the drug. \"As soon as we see that, we'll get rid of the other 10%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/trump-urges-republicans-to-take-the-nuclear-option-scrap-filibuster\">Trump has also urged Senate Republicans to overhaul the filibuster rule</a> as the government shutdown extends to its 31st day, the second-longest on record behind the 35-day shutdown in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>\"It is now time for the Republicans to play their 'TRUMP CARD,' and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW,\" Trump said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/trump-dashboard\">Truth Social post</a>. He argued that ending the filibuster would allow legislation to pass with a simple majority in a GOP-controlled Senate, improving the odds of reopening the government.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued that the recent <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic/fed-interest-rate-decision-6969\">25 bps rate cut</a> was unnecessary given a balanced labor market and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators/inflation-rate\">inflation</a> remaining above the Fed's 2% target. She stated she would be <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/feds-logan-pushes-back-on-rate-cut-hopes\">unlikely to support another rate cut in December</a> unless clear evidence emerged that inflation is falling faster than expected or that the labor market is cooling significantly. </p>\n<p>Logan's position aligns with that of Fed Bank of Kansas City President Jeff Schmid, the only October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voter to advocate for holding rates steady. Schmid warned that even a 25 bps rate cut wouldn't meaningfully affect labor market conditions but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/are-stocks-overbought-naaim-exposure-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-july-2024\">National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index</a>, which measures the exposure active investment managers have to U.S. stocks, climbed above 100 for the first time since July 2024.

The benchmark index is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23x, well above its 20-year average of roughly 16x.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">S&amp;P 500</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/spx\">SPX</a>) closed with a 0.26% gain, while the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">Nasdaq 100</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100\">NDX</a>) returned 0.48%.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay ahead of macro events with our up-to-the-minute </strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/calendars/economic\"><strong>Economic Calendar</strong></a><strong> — filter by impact, country, and more.</strong></p>",

            "title": "IBM Researchers Discover a New Quantum Algorithm",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>These coefficients are important in both physics and mathematics, but extremely hard to compute using regular computers. The IBM team believed that this problem fit a new category they called QXC, short for \"quantum approximate counting,\" where <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/ibm-and-the-basque-government-open-europes-first-ibm-quantum-system-two\">quantum computers</a> can estimate how many valid solutions exist. By using a version of phase estimation (a quantum algorithm that helps find hidden values linked to how a quantum system behaves), the researchers designed an algorithm that can handle this task far more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the work caused Mathematician Greta Panova from USC to review the findings and challenge the initial claim of a super-polynomial speedup. She ultimately disproved that bold claim but confirmed a smaller, still meaningful advantage: the quantum algorithm outperforms classical ones by a large margin when scaled. As a result, IBM researcher Vojtěch Havlíček believes that this work not only pushes quantum research forward but could also lead to new breakthroughs across both fields.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is IBM a Buy, Sell, or Hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on IBM stock based on six Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm/forecast\">average IBM price target</a>&nbsp;of $294.75 per share implies 3.8% downside risk.</p>",
