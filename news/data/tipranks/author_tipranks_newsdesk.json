The company’s Investor Day savings program is on track, contributing CHF 31 million in savings year-to-date. Despite facing currency headwinds and lower volumes, Clariant’s strategic focus on cost efficiency and performance improvements has bolstered its profitability. </p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Clariant maintains its 2025 outlook, expecting local currency sales growth at the lower end of the 1-3% range and an EBITDA margin before exceptional items between 17% and 18%.
