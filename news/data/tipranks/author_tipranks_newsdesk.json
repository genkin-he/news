While total assets were broadly flat, equity attributable to shareholders rose 2.6%, as the company absorbed weaker module shipments, higher tariffs and manufacturing costs, partly offset by growing energy storage revenue and strategic prioritization of high-value markets amid an oversupplied, highly competitive PV sector.</p>\n<p>Management said 2025 performance was hit by lower module volumes, margin pressure and reduced non-recurring gains such as subsidies, even as energy storage backlogs moved into execution and monetization, supporting profitability. Against a continuing supply-demand imbalance and rising external uncertainties in the photovoltaic industry, CSI Solar pursued a “profit-first” strategy, optimizing shipment mix, focusing on key regions and long-term customers to maintain and expand market share, while warning that the figures, disclosed on February 28, 2026, are preliminary and subject to change once audited annual results are published.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CSIQ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/csiq\">(CSIQ)</a> stock is a Sell with a $20.00 price target.
