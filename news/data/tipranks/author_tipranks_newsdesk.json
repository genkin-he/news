Discovery entity holding the company’s Streaming &amp; Studios businesses, leaving WBD’s Global Linear Networks and certain other assets separated. This structure was designed to make the retained WBD streaming and studio operations a wholly owned Netflix subsidiary, supported by a package of committed bridge and term financing arrangements.</p>\n<p>However, on February 26, 2026, Warner Bros. Discovery notified Netflix that a revised offer from Paramount Skydance Corporation constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement. Netflix waived its right to negotiate changes, and on February 27, 2026, WBD terminated the deal with Netflix to sign a merger agreement with Paramount Skydance, triggering a $2.8 billion termination fee payable to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement on February 27, 2026, all related financing commitments arranged by Netflix, including a bridge commitment letter, incremental bridge facility, a 2025 revolving credit facility and a delayed draw term loan, were automatically canceled. These facilities had been intended to fund the proposed acquisition and associated costs, so their termination effectively unwinds the capital structure Netflix had put in place for the abandoned transaction.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"NFLX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx\">(NFLX)</a> stock is a Buy with a $120.00 price target.

Management said the deal validates its acquisition and repositioning discipline after buying the hotel before COVID, managing through the industry’s disruption and exiting when it sees more attractive capital uses.</p>\n<p>The company plans to recycle the sale proceeds, add new equity from its in-house capital markets platform and institutional partners, and begin expanding the CHT hotel portfolio in 2026. By repositioning CHT to target distressed but cash-flowing branded hotels facing loan maturities and capital needs, Caliber aims to capitalize on what it views as a more attractive 2026–2027 acquisition window, potentially boosting fee-based revenues and operating leverage as the platform scales.</p>\n<p>As sector-wide capital structures remain strained and many hotels require brand-mandated improvements and operational fixes, CHT is positioning itself as a flexible recapitalization partner offering tax-advantaged contributions, debt restructuring and renovation expertise. The strategy is designed to maximize distributable cash flow per dollar of equity and, as the trust grows, could support future liquidity options that enhance value for both CHT investors and Caliber shareholders.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CWD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cwd\">(CWD)</a> stock is a Hold with a $1.00 price target.

Trading in Avidity shares, already halted the evening of February 26, 2026, is set to be suspended from Nasdaq on March 2, 2026, after which the company plans to deregister its stock and end its SEC reporting obligations, converting each outstanding share into the right to receive merger consideration and eliminating public stockholder rights.</p>\n<p>As a result of the merger, Avidity experienced a change in control and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquiring parent, with no further change in control arrangements known to the company.
