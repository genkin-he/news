The syndicate of underwriters, led by <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/firms/stifel-nicolaus\">Stifel Nicolaus</a> Canada Inc. and including several major Canadian investment dealers, received a 5% cash commission on most of the offering, while a reduced commission applied to shares sold via a president’s list.</p>\n<p>The company plans to use the net proceeds primarily to advance permitting and engineering activities at its flagship Casino Project in the Yukon, with the balance earmarked for general corporate and working capital needs. Insider participation by a director and an officer, totaling 80,500 shares and $334,075 in proceeds, was treated as a related-party transaction under Canadian securities rules but remained below thresholds requiring a formal valuation or minority shareholder approval, signaling board support for the financing structure without triggering additional governance processes.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"TSE:WRN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:wrn\">(TSE:WRN)</a> stock is a Buy with a C$7.50 price target.

The company expanded invested capital outside its cornerstone Lennar Master Program Agreement to $2.4 billion, reached 142,000 homesites across 933 communities in 30 states, distributed 100% of AFFO via a $0.75 per share dividend declared December 22, 2025, and entered 2026 with $1.3 billion in liquidity, a conservative 26% debt-to-capital ratio, and a robust growth pipeline that further entrenches its role as a key capital and land partner to major U.S. homebuilders.</p>\n<p>Millrose’s 2025 performance reflected strong industry traction despite a cautious homebuilding backdrop, as it added 15 builder counterparties, including nine of the top 25 national builders, generated recurring cash flows from option fees and development income, and recorded zero option terminations across its portfolio. With $9.2 billion in homesites under option and related assets and disciplined leverage well below its 33% target, the company’s growing non-Lennar relationships and efficient capital recycling reinforce its competitive positioning in residential land finance and suggest continued benefits for shareholders through sustained AFFO-driven distributions and diversified builder exposure.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"MRP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mrp\">(MRP)</a> stock is a Buy with a $34.00 price target.

The company executed nearly $330 million of asset sales, over $2 billion of capital transactions that extended debt maturities and boosted liquidity to $933.6 million, and delivered cost savings via lower general and administrative expenses and operational changes.</p>\n<p>Despite stronger leasing, including 2.2 million square feet of office leases signed in 2025 and a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption, Hudson Pacific recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $277.9 million due largely to a non-cash impairment at Quixote and one-time lease-termination-related items. The firm sold the Element LA campus for $150 million plus an $81 million lease termination payment to reduce CMBS debt, completed the Sunset Pier 94 Studios project with about 90% of the facility leased early in its first year, modestly improved occupancy across its office and studio portfolios, and set a 2026 full-year FFO outlook of $0.96 to $1.06 per diluted share, signaling expectations of returning to FFO growth while pursuing further deleveraging and occupancy gains.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HPP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hpp\">(HPP)</a> stock is a Hold with a $10.00 price target.

Story will retire from his CFO and Treasurer roles at the close of business on March 31, 2026. The board elected veteran finance executive Linda C. Pinne, currently Senior Vice President, Global Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to succeed him as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer, effective on the same transition date.</p>\n<p>Story, who has served as CFO since March 2006 and spent 20 years with the company, will remain employed as Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2026 to ensure a gradual transition of his responsibilities. During his tenure, Manhattan’s revenue rose about 275%, operating cash flow about 785% and market capitalization more than 50-fold, underscoring his role in supporting the company’s transformation into an <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-native platform business.</p>\n<p>To govern the transition, Manhattan entered into a Retirement and Advisory Agreement under which Story will continue to receive his current base salary while serving as advisor and will be eligible for a first-quarter 2026 performance cash bonus but no further cash bonuses thereafter. His unvested restricted stock units will continue to vest during his advisory term, with remaining unvested awards vesting at his retirement date, subject to specific treatment for performance-based units and standard conditions around termination, death or disability.</p>\n<p>The Retirement Agreement replaces his prior executive employment agreement for most purposes but carries forward key provisions such as intellectual property, confidentiality and restrictive covenants, and includes customary releases and non-disparagement terms. The company also agreed to pay up to 12 months of COBRA premiums after his retirement or earlier termination, while retaining the right to end benefits if he leaves early under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>CEO Eric Clark publicly praised Story’s contributions in a February 26, 2026 press release and highlighted his influence on Manhattan’s growth strategy and global finance organization. Clark also emphasized Pinne’s deep knowledge of Manhattan’s operations, customers and strategy, signaling continuity in financial leadership and a focus on sustaining the company’s leadership in the supply chain commerce market.</p>\n<p>Pinne, a more than 20-year finance veteran at Manhattan who has led global corporate controller and accounting functions since 2016, has been central to strengthening financial processes and controls and supporting growth. Her elevation to CFO, along with Manhattan’s reaffirmation of its 2026 financial guidance and planned participation in upcoming investor conferences, is likely to reassure investors about stability in the finance function during the leadership transition.\n</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"MANH\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/manh\">(MANH)</a> stock is a Buy with a $145.00 price target.

Quarterly revenue rose to $720 million from $678 million and net income from continuing operations swung to a $78 million profit from an $11 million loss, while adjusted EBITDA climbed to $130 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS improved to $0.31.</p>\n<p>For 2025 as a whole, revenue slipped to $2.69 billion from $2.82 billion, but the company moved from a $201 million net loss to $42 million in net income, boosted adjusted EBITDA to $425 million and sharply improved non-GAAP EPS to $0.90. Management highlighted progress in repositioning NCR Voyix as a platform-led business, underscored by the January 2026 launch of its largest cloud-to-edge application portfolio, new long-term POS platform deals with 7-Eleven Philippines and Colruyt Group, an expanding base of 80,000 platform sites, and $78 million of share repurchases.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to 2026, the company guided to lower reported revenue of $2.21 billion to $2.33 billion due to a shift in hardware revenue recognition from an ongoing ODM transition, but indicated pro forma revenue would be roughly flat to modestly higher. NCR Voyix expects adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS to grow further, alongside a substantial increase in adjusted free cash flow, suggesting improving operational efficiency and a business mix tilting more heavily toward software, services and recurring revenue streams.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"VYX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vyx\">(VYX)</a> stock is a Buy with a $15.00 price target.

Meanwhile, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-based analysis flagged weakening revenue and margin trends and negative technical momentum, partly offset by stable gross margins, deleveraging, and ongoing shareholder returns.</p>\n<p><b><u>Spark’s Take on POOL Stock</u></b></p>\n<p>According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, POOL is a Neutral.</p>\n<p>The score is held back primarily by weakening financial trajectory (revenue and margin compression, softer recent cash flow) and very weak technicals (below key moving averages with negative momentum).
