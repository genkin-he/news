            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The actual inflation rate matched analyst estimates at 2.1%, suggesting that the market had accurately anticipated this minor decrease. This alignment may lead to a muted reaction in the stock market, with sectors sensitive to inflation, such as consumer goods and utilities, likely experiencing minimal impact.
