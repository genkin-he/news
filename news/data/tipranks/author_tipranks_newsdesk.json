Quarterly revenue rose to $720 million from $678 million and net income from continuing operations swung to a $78 million profit from an $11 million loss, while adjusted EBITDA climbed to $130 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS improved to $0.31.</p>\n<p>For 2025 as a whole, revenue slipped to $2.69 billion from $2.82 billion, but the company moved from a $201 million net loss to $42 million in net income, boosted adjusted EBITDA to $425 million and sharply improved non-GAAP EPS to $0.90. Management highlighted progress in repositioning NCR Voyix as a platform-led business, underscored by the January 2026 launch of its largest cloud-to-edge application portfolio, new long-term POS platform deals with 7-Eleven Philippines and Colruyt Group, an expanding base of 80,000 platform sites, and $78 million of share repurchases.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to 2026, the company guided to lower reported revenue of $2.21 billion to $2.33 billion due to a shift in hardware revenue recognition from an ongoing ODM transition, but indicated pro forma revenue would be roughly flat to modestly higher. NCR Voyix expects adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS to grow further, alongside a substantial increase in adjusted free cash flow, suggesting improving operational efficiency and a business mix tilting more heavily toward software, services and recurring revenue streams.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"VYX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vyx\">(VYX)</a> stock is a Buy with a $15.00 price target.

Offsetting this, the latest earnings call was constructive with strong adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, recurring revenue/ARR growth, and a major customer win (Chipotle).

Management highlighted record and near-record volumes, meaningful cost savings, and growth in higher-margin businesses, but also flagged a heavy 2025 working-capital drag, higher net debt, and a sharp sulfur-driven margin squeeze that will weigh on early 2026 results.</p>\n<h2>Phosphate Production Recovery and 2026 Output Targets</h2>\n<p>Mosaic reported Q4 2025 phosphate output of 1.7 million tonnes, a solid result considering an extended turnaround at the Bartow facility. Management now guides to at least 7.0 million tonnes of phosphate production in 2026, framing this as a base case with upside as operating performance normalizes through the year.</p>\n<h2>Potash Production Strength and Esterhazy Momentum</h2>\n<p>Potash remained a bright spot, with international sales hitting a record in 2025 as the Esterhazy mine returned to full operating rates and HydroFloat ramped up. For 2026, Mosaic expects to produce roughly 9 million tonnes of potash, similar to 2025, and is targeting record output from Esterhazy while running the potash system at high operating rates.</p>\n<h2>Material Cost and Efficiency Improvements</h2>\n<p>The company delivered $150 million of cost savings in 2025 ahead of schedule, underscoring a sharpened focus on efficiency and technology. It aims to capture an additional $100 million of savings in 2026 via technology-enabled initiatives, supply chain optimization, and supplier consolidation across its global footprint.</p>\n<h2>Phosphate Conversion Costs Moving Lower</h2>\n<p>Fourth-quarter phosphate cash conversion costs came in at $112 per tonne, improving roughly $20 per tonne from the high watermark reached earlier in 2025. Management believes further structural efficiencies and scale can push conversion costs below $100 per tonne over time, which would materially enhance margins once markets recover.</p>\n<h2>Potash Cash Cost Competitiveness</h2>\n<p>Mosaic’s 2025 potash cash cost of production averaged $75 per tonne, putting the business near its long-term cost goals. Executives said they would have fully met Analyst Day targets if not for the higher-cost extension at the Colonsay mine, highlighting underlying competitiveness as a key strategic advantage.</p>\n<h2>Brazil Rock Cost Progress and Capacity Expansion</h2>\n<p>In Brazil, rock output reached near-record levels in 2025 while Mosaic Fertilizantes cut its blended rock cost per tonne to $97, the lowest since 2021. The company also completed a 1 million tonne blending facility at Palmeirante, which should expand distribution capacity and support future growth as Brazilian demand normalizes.</p>\n<h2>Explosive Growth at Mosaic Biosciences</h2>\n<p>Mosaic Biosciences, the company’s specialty and biologicals platform, doubled net sales to $68 million in 2025 while reaching more than 60 registrations and selling into 16 countries. Management expects another year of doubling net sales in 2026 supported by 8 to 10 new product launches and gross margins in the 40% range.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Reallocation and Asset Monetization</h2>\n<p>Mosaic pushed ahead with portfolio cleanup, divesting several noncore assets including Patos de Minas and Taquari, with a pending sale of Carlsbad still to close. Transactions announced in 2025 are expected to generate around $170 million in proceeds and reduce asset retirement obligations by roughly $60 million, while the firm’s Ma’aden equity stake remains a sizable financial asset.</p>\n<h2>Working Capital Release Potential in 2026</h2>\n<p>After a heavy 2025 cash hit from inventory, management now sees a $300 million to $500 million working capital release as highly possible in 2026. The unwind is expected to be driven by inventory drawdown, including about 240,000 tonnes of excess phosphate rock worth roughly $140 million at current values, alongside a gradual demand recovery.</p>\n<h2>Capital Expenditure Path and Investment Priorities</h2>\n<p>Mosaic guided to around $1.5 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, above 2025 levels as it funds gyp stack and clay settling projects. Executives characterize this as a near-term peak, with total CapEx expected to drift down toward roughly $1.0 billion by 2030 as major environmental and sustaining projects roll off.</p>\n<h2>Sharp U.S. Phosphate Demand Weakness</h2>\n<p>The company faced a pronounced demand shock in U.S. phosphate markets during Q4 2025, tied to farmer affordability challenges and uncertainty around government payments. North American phosphate shipments slid to about 8.5 million tonnes in 2025 from roughly 10 million tonnes previously, representing an estimated 15% year-over-year decline.</p>\n<h2>Inventory Build and Cash Flow Drag</h2>\n<p>Inventory builds in both finished goods and key raw materials produced a severe cash flow drag of approximately $960 million in 2025. The working-capital surge helped push net debt higher by about $829 million and drove EBITDA-to-cash conversion down to the mid-30% range, far below Mosaic’s roughly 70% normalized target.</p>\n<h2>Sulfur Price Spike and Margin Compression</h2>\n<p>A sharp run-up in sulfur prices since December 2025 is now one of Mosaic’s most immediate headwinds, particularly in Phosphates and Mosaic Fertilizantes. Management estimates an EBITDA headwind of roughly $250 million in the first quarter of 2026 versus the prior year and noted that every $10 per tonne move in sulfur adds around $10 million in quarterly expense.</p>\n<h2>Idled Low-Margin Brazilian Assets</h2>\n<p>In response to the sulfur shock and weaker margins, Mosaic idled the Araxa and Fospar operations in Brazil until conditions improve. While the move protects profitability, it also weighs on near-term volumes and contributed to narrower distribution margins in Brazil as the company prioritized margin over share.</p>\n<h2>Working Capital Concentration and Liquidity Pressure</h2>\n<p>A significant portion of Mosaic’s elevated working capital stems from excess phosphate inventory and higher-value purchased nutrients, particularly in Brazil and North America. This concentration amplified liquidity pressure in 2025 but also sets up an opportunity for meaningful cash release as those inventories are sold down in 2026.</p>\n<h2>Balance Sheet Actions and Capital Returns</h2>\n<p>To manage funding needs, Mosaic issued $900 million of 3- and 5-year notes in late 2025, primarily to retire short-term commercial paper and extend maturities. With net debt higher and cash flow temporarily depressed, management indicated that more aggressive capital returns will likely be deferred until working capital normalizes and sulfur pressure subsides.</p>\n<h2>Phosphate Recovery Slower Than Planned</h2>\n<p>Executives acknowledged that phosphate production recovery in 2025 lagged earlier internal targets, with the business failing to reach the 2.0 million tonne per quarter goal late in the year. Guidance is now anchored in demonstrated throughput levels of about 1.7 to 1.8 million tonnes per quarter, with an emphasis on delivering consistent, verifiable improvement.</p>\n<h2>Brazil Market and Credit Constraints</h2>\n<p>In Brazil, high <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">interest rates</a> and tighter credit conditions constrained demand and forced Mosaic to adopt more disciplined selling practices. Management plans to remain selective on customer credit, which could limit near-term volume growth even as the company views rising acreage and yield potential as a compelling long-term opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Forward-Looking Outlook and 2026 Guidance</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Mosaic expects stable potash production of roughly 9 million tonnes and at least 7 million tonnes of phosphate in 2026, supported by improving unit costs in both segments. Management is betting on a $300 million to $500 million working capital release, moderating environmental cash spend, and continued growth in Mosaic Biosciences to offset sulfur headwinds and gradually restore cash generation.</p>\n<p>Mosaic’s earnings call showcased a company that has done much of the heavy lifting on operations and costs but is navigating a tough near-term macro and commodity backdrop. Investors will be watching whether sulfur moderates, inventories clear, and Brazilian demand and credit improve, which together would allow Mosaic’s efficiency gains and potash strength to flow more visibly into earnings and free cash flow.</p>",

While acknowledging commodity volatility and seasonal production softness, executives highlighted a deep, flexible drilling inventory and locked-in service costs that position the company to navigate a choppy gas market with significant optionality.</p>\n<h2>Strong Free Cash Flow and Cash Generation</h2>\n<p>Range reported cash flow from operations before working capital of $1.3 billion and more than $650 million in free cash flow for 2025. That cash enabled $86 million in dividends, $231 million of share repurchases and $186 million of net debt reduction, underscoring the company’s ability to both reward shareholders and strengthen its balance sheet.</p>\n<h2>Improved Per-Unit Margins and Realized Price Premium</h2>\n<p>Per-unit cash margins expanded by roughly 20% to $1.64 per Mcfe, reflecting a mix of efficiency gains and pricing strength. Range realized an average hedged price of $3.60 per Mcfe versus a $3.43 NYMEX Henry Hub average in 2025, a roughly 5% premium driven by its commodity mix, hedging strategy and diversified transportation and sales portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Operational Efficiency and Drilling/Completion Productivity</h2>\n<p>Capital discipline remained tight, with Q4 all-in capital of $183 million and full-year 2025 capital of $674 million, while activity levels stayed high. The company ran two horizontal rigs in Q4, drilled about 225,000 horizontal feet across 15 long laterals and completed roughly 1,200 frac stages in the quarter, helping set a new annual benchmark of nearly 3,800 stages at about 10 stages per day per crew.</p>\n<h2>Large, Flexible Inventory to Support Optionality</h2>\n<p>Range now controls more than 500,000 lateral feet of growth-focused inventory, roughly 100,000 feet more than previously outlined, giving management room to tailor activity to market conditions. This inventory supports either holding D&amp;C spending below $600 million to produce around 2.6 Bcfe per day or stepping up to $650–700 million in 2027 to drive additional growth into 2028.</p>\n<h2>Export and Marketing Strength</h2>\n<p>The company continues to benefit from robust U.S. export trends, with LNG exports averaging more than 17 Bcf per day in Q4 and waterborne ethane exports estimated at 622,000 barrels per day, sharply higher year over year. During winter storm Fern, marketing teams redirected LNG feed gas into the domestic market and captured elevated midweek pricing, including February settlements above $7 per MMBtu.</p>\n<h2>Service Cost Stability and Contracting Wins</h2>\n<p>Range’s latest request-for-proposal process for 2026 drilling and completions delivered service pricing that is flat to slightly lower versus 2025. A slate of multiyear contracts, including a two-year base electric frac fleet agreement starting in 2026, should provide cost stability and help preserve the company’s peer-leading well costs and capital efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Capital Allocation and Shareholder Returns Framework</h2>\n<p>Since 2019, Range has repurchased more than 33 million shares, deploying about $744 million and signaling confidence in the company’s intrinsic value. The board’s decision to lift buyback capacity to $1.5 billion and the planned 11% dividend increase highlight a balanced strategy that blends cash returns with ongoing deleveraging.</p>\n<h2>Safety and Environmental Actions</h2>\n<p>Management stressed that strong operational performance has been paired with one of the best safety records in company history, reinforcing a focus on execution quality. Looking ahead, Range plans to invest $15–25 million in 2026 on software and production-facility upgrades while finishing a pneumatic retrofit program, moves aimed at lowering emissions and tightening operational control.</p>\n<h2>Commodity Price Volatility and Weaker Curve</h2>\n<p>Executives were candid about the weaker gas forward curve versus last year and the resulting uncertainty around timing of production turn-ins. Q1 production is expected to dip to about 2.2 Bcfe per day from roughly 2.3 Bcfe per day in Q4 due to seasonality, leaving the company more reliant on second-half improvements and market conditions.</p>\n<h2>Elevated NGL Inventories and Petchem Margin Pressure</h2>\n<p>Despite robust growth in ethane exports, the NGL complex remains challenged by elevated inventory levels and historically weak petrochemical margins. These thin margins are pressuring operating rates at petrochemical plants, which in turn contributed to softer propane demand throughout 2025 and added another overhang to liquids pricing.</p>\n<h2>Limited Further Operating Cost Downside</h2>\n<p>Management cautioned that service costs appear to be near an asymptotic bottom, with only low- to mid-single-digit relief expected in 2026. As a result, operating expense assumptions are essentially flat, suggesting that future margin expansion will need to come more from productivity gains, mix and price rather than from large incremental cost cuts.</p>\n<h2>Reliance on Infrastructure Timing and Market Access</h2>\n<p>Range’s expected second-half production ramp in 2026 depends heavily on the midyear commissioning of roughly 300 MMcf per day of new processing capacity and other debottlenecking work. Any delays or underperformance in these midstream projects could push back the step-up in volumes and cash flow that is currently embedded in the company’s outlook.</p>\n<h2>Unspecified Commercial Terms and Execution Risk</h2>\n<p>The company highlighted certain new commercial agreements, including long-term sales tied to premium power demand, as key contributors to future value. However, with pricing details kept confidential, investors face some uncertainty over the exact size and timing of these premium cash flows, which introduces an element of execution and disclosure risk.</p>\n<h2>Guidance and Forward-Looking Outlook</h2>\n<p>For 2026, Range guided to all-in capital of $650–700 million, including about $500 million for maintenance D&amp;C and $120–140 million of growth D&amp;C, along with modest land and emissions-related spending. The plan contemplates a single full-time drilling rig with a second in the back half, about 900,000 lateral feet turned to sales, production of 2.35–2.40 Bcfe per day and a midyear capacity addition that could lift exit volumes toward 2.5 Bcfe per day, with optionality to reach about 2.6 Bcfe per day in 2027 at sub-$0.60 per Mcfe D&amp;C costs.</p>\n<p>Range’s call painted the picture of a gas producer leaning hard on efficiency, marketing savvy and inventory depth to thrive despite macro headwinds. While commodity prices, NGL balances and infrastructure timing remain key swing factors, the company’s strong free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and locked-in service costs provide a solid foundation that investors will be watching closely in the coming quarters.</p>",
