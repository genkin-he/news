However, the company’s income from operations decreased by 18% to $35.3 million, and diluted earnings per share fell to $0.11 from $0.17 in the same quarter of 2024.</p>\n<p>Key highlights from the report include a 17% increase in Truckload revenues, largely driven by the acquisition of Cowan Systems, and a 6% rise in Intermodal revenues due to strong volume growth. Despite these gains, the company faced challenges such as increased claims costs and sub-seasonal market trends, which impacted overall profitability.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Schneider National remains focused on driving structural improvements and leveraging its strong balance sheet to enhance shareholder value. The company has adjusted its full-year 2025 guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $0.70, with net capital expenditures expected to be around $300 million.</p>",
