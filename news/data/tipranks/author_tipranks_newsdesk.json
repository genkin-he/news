While earnings came in just shy of last year’s peak and some regional pressures surfaced, executives framed these as manageable headwinds against a strong growth and deleveraging story into 2026.</p>\n<h2>Record Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Streak Extends</h2>\n<p>Churchill Downs reported record net revenue and record adjusted EBITDA for 2025, including record fourth-quarter figures. Excluding the pandemic year, this marks nine consecutive years of record top-line and adjusted EBITDA performance, reinforcing the company’s ability to compound growth through both its racing and gaming platforms.</p>\n<h2>Kentucky Derby and Derby Week Powerhouse</h2>\n<p>The Kentucky Derby franchise remained the crown jewel, delivering record handle for the race, Derby Day program and Derby Week overall. The company also posted the highest television ratings in nearly four decades and expects the 2026 Derby to generate an additional $15 million to $20 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA.</p>\n<h2>Robust Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns</h2>\n<p>Free cash flow surged to a record $700 million, or $9.75 per share, underscoring the cash-generative nature of the portfolio. Management deployed this strength by repurchasing over 4.2 million shares, returning more than $456 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, and extending its streak of annual dividend-per-share increases to 15 years.</p>\n<h2>HRM Footprint Expansion and New Projects</h2>\n<p>The company continued to build out its historical racing machine network with new openings in Owensboro, Marshall Yards and Roseshire, alongside progress on The Rose project. It also announced a major $180 million to $200 million investment in the Rockingham Grand Casino in Salem, New Hampshire, signaling confidence in long-term regional demand.</p>\n<h2>Wagering Services Growth Led by Exacta</h2>\n<p>The Wagering Services and Solutions segment posted a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA for 2025, driven primarily by growth in Exacta. Management highlighted ongoing momentum in business-to-business deployments, adding new customers in Kansas and Alabama that broaden the distribution of its wagering technology.</p>\n<h2>Electronic Table Games as a New Growth Avenue</h2>\n<p>Churchill Downs secured regulatory approval in Kentucky and launched roulette electronic table games in early February, opening a new product channel. While the ETG rollout contributed nothing to 2025 results, the company views the early-stage deployment and potential additions like craps and blackjack as a meaningful long-term earnings lever.</p>\n<h2>Churchill Downs Racetrack Upgrades and Capacity Gains</h2>\n<p>At the flagship racetrack, the company completed renovations including the starting gate Pavilion for roughly 8,100 guests and a redesigned Paddock. Ongoing work on the Mansion and Finish Line Suites remains on time and on budget, and the upcoming Victory Run project will add about 1,400 seats, a 22% capacity boost in that premium area.</p>\n<h2>Disciplined Capital Allocation and Leverage Management</h2>\n<p>Maintenance capital expenditure totaled $70 million in 2025 with expectations rising to $90 million to $110 million in 2026, while project capex was $205 million and is guided to $180 million to $220 million next year. Bank covenant net leverage stood at 4.1x at year-end 2025, and management anticipates this ratio falling below 4.0x during 2026 as strong cash flow supports further balance sheet improvement.</p>\n<h2>Earnings Below Peak Amid Tough Comparisons</h2>\n<p>Despite record revenue and adjusted EBITDA, management acknowledged that overall earnings landed slightly below the prior year’s record level. The company cited challenging year-over-year comparisons and pockets of economic uncertainty earlier in 2025, but stressed that core demand trends and project execution remain on track.</p>\n<h2>Tariff Volatility and Sales-Cycle Disruptions</h2>\n<p>Executives flagged that <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a>-related volatility and broader macro uncertainty disrupted the sales process for certain events late in the selling cycle. This timing issue weighed on revenue cadence earlier in 2025, but was portrayed as a transitory factor rather than a structural change in demand.</p>\n<h2>Regional Gaming Margins Face Mild Pressure</h2>\n<p>Same-store wholly owned casino margins, excluding racing, slipped by 0.8 percentage points versus 2024, with softness concentrated in Mississippi. Management linked this modest compression to local market challenges and emphasized that the overall regional portfolio remains resilient and profitable.</p>\n<h2>Weather and Local Issues Temporarily Impact Operations</h2>\n<p>Significant January weather events and localized disruptions, including roadwork and curfews in Mississippi plus adverse conditions in December, created short-term revenue headwinds. The company noted that underlying customer demand held up well once these temporary obstacles eased.</p>\n<h2>Deliberate ETG Rollout Strategy</h2>\n<p>The ETG initiative remains in a measured ramp-up phase, starting with roulette and expanding only as products prove themselves with customers and regulators. Management stressed that ETGs provided no incremental benefit to 2025 results and are being managed as a multi-year earnings opportunity rather than a quick fix.</p>\n<h2>Regulatory and Legislative Uncertainty</h2>\n<p>The company continues to monitor legislative developments around iGaming and other competitive shifts, calling out Virginia discussions as a potential risk to its operations there. While management views iGaming as unfavorable for its Virginia properties, it framed this as an ongoing policy watch item rather than an immediate financial shock.</p>\n<h2>Guidance Signals Confident 2026 Outlook</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Churchill Downs expects the 2026 Kentucky Derby to contribute $15 million to $20 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA as Derby Week expands to seven live race dates across eight days with attendance around 75,000 and pacing already ahead of prior years. Project capex is projected at $180 million to $220 million, maintenance capex at $90 million to $110 million and leverage is expected to drop below 4.0x, supported by continued strong cash generation after 2025’s $700 million free cash flow.</p>\n<p>Overall, the earnings call painted the picture of a company leaning into its marquee Derby brand, expanding HRM and ETG platforms and returning significant capital while keeping leverage in check. Short-term margin and macro bumps were acknowledged but framed as manageable, leaving investors with a narrative centered on sustained cash flow, disciplined investment and a constructive growth trajectory into 2026 and beyond.</p>",

Management leaned into the potential of lonvo-z as a first-in-class in vivo CRISPR therapy while acknowledging that the unresolved FDA hold on the key cardiomyopathy program continues to cap investor confidence.</p>\n<h2>Lonvo-z Phase 3 on Track for First Pivotal CRISPR Readout</h2>\n<p>Intellia confirmed that the HAELO Phase 3 trial of lonvo-z in hereditary angioedema is fully enrolled, with 80 patients recruited in roughly nine months. Top-line data are expected by mid-2026, and the company is targeting a BLA filing in the second half of 2026, positioning lonvo-z for the first pivotal readout of an in vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy.</p>\n<h2>Robust Patient and Physician Appetite for Gene Editing in HAE</h2>\n<p>Survey work suggests a receptive U.S. market for lonvo-z if the data hold up, with 99% of patients indicating at least some willingness to take a gene-editing therapy and nearly two-thirds reporting they are extremely or very likely to do so. Among 151 U.S. physicians managing more than 4,000 patients, 92% said they could identify candidates and estimated they would prescribe lonvo-z to roughly 2,200, or about 54% of their treated population.</p>\n<h2>Durable Efficacy Signals Support Lonvo-z’s One-Time Treatment Thesis</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted durability data from early-phase studies, noting up to three years of follow-up without evidence of waning serum kallikrein or TTR suppression. A pooled analysis showed that 76% of patients at least one year beyond a 50 mg dose were free of attacks and off ongoing therapy for 12 months or more, a stark contrast with current prophylactics, where roughly 20% of patients remain attack-free.</p>\n<h2>Q4 2025 Numbers Show Improving P&amp;L Discipline</h2>\n<p>On the financial front, Intellia delivered stronger fourth-quarter metrics, with collaboration revenue rising to $23.0 million from $12.9 million, a gain of about 78% year over year. R&amp;D spending fell to $88.7 million from $116.9 million, helping narrow the quarterly net loss to $95.8 million from $128.9 million, a sign of tightening cost control as key trials mature.</p>\n<h2>Cash Runway Extends into 2027 but Headroom Has Shrunk</h2>\n<p>The company closed 2025 with $605.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, down from $861.7 million a year earlier, a roughly 30% decline. Management believes this balance is sufficient to fund operations into the second half of 2027 and carry Intellia through major lonvo-z milestones, while commercial manufacturing, field teams and payer outreach for a possible launch are already largely in place.</p>\n<h2>MAGNITUDE-2 ATTR Polyneuropathy Program Back in Motion</h2>\n<p>Regulatory fortunes were mixed, with the FDA lifting the clinical hold on MAGNITUDE-2 for ATTR polyneuropathy in late January after agreeing on tighter safety measures. The study now includes additional early post-dose liver testing, a short-course steroid protocol for liver function spikes and refined screening, and its enrollment target has risen to about 60 patients, with 47 already recruited heading into an expected completion in the second half of 2026.</p>\n<h2>Cardiomyopathy Trial Remains Frozen Under FDA Scrutiny</h2>\n<p>By contrast, MAGNITUDE in ATTR cardiomyopathy remains on full clinical hold after serious liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations in one patient, halting a trial that had already enrolled more than 650 participants, above its original 550-patient plan. Intellia is in ongoing dialogue with regulators and has proposed similar risk-mitigation steps, but no green light has yet been granted, leaving the largest commercial opportunity in limbo.</p>\n<h2>Serious Adverse Event Clouds Safety Profile and Adds Risk</h2>\n<p>The safety narrative was dominated by a patient in MAGNITUDE who developed Grade 4 elevations in liver transaminases and bilirubin and later died from a ruptured duodenal ulcer, with causality to treatment unclear. While the company said such severe liver events occurred in less than 1% of patients and appear immune-mediated, the mechanism is not fully understood, introducing meaningful regulatory and pipeline risk.</p>\n<h2>Cash Burn and Operational Disruption Highlight Execution Challenges</h2>\n<p>The roughly 30% year-over-year drop in cash underscores the cost of building a first-wave CRISPR business despite the improved quarterly loss profile. Operationally, the October enrollment suspension in MAGNITUDE and MAGNITUDE-2, subsequent FDA pauses and protocol amendments have added complexity and time, even as MAGNITUDE-2 now resumes under tighter monitoring requirements.</p>\n<h2>Pipeline Read-Through and HAE Reproducibility Remain Open Questions</h2>\n<p>Management acknowledged that it cannot yet definitively determine whether the liver toxicity signal is unique to the TTR target or could emerge in other in vivo CRISPR programs, leaving investors with unanswered questions about broader platform risk. Executives also flagged that Phase 1/2 HAE data came largely from ex-U.S. patients while Phase 3 includes U.S. subjects with potentially different baseline characteristics, creating some risk around how well early efficacy will translate.</p>\n<h2>Forward-Looking Outlook: Pivotal 2026 Data and Launch Ambitions</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Intellia framed 2026 as a pivotal year, with HAELO Phase 3 top-line lonvo-z data expected by mid-year, a planned BLA submission in the second half and a potential 2027 commercial launch if results and regulators cooperate. The company aims to complete MAGNITUDE-2 enrollment in the second half of 2026 under new liver-monitoring and steroid protocols, while managing a cash runway into late 2027 and betting that strong patient and physician interest will translate into substantial uptake if lonvo-z reaches the market.</p>\n<p>Intellia’s call painted the picture of a high-upside but high-risk story, with lonvo-z nearing a watershed CRISPR readout that could redefine HAE treatment and the company’s valuation. Yet the unresolved cardiomyopathy hold, safety uncertainties and a shrinking cash cushion temper the bull case, leaving investors to weigh breakthrough potential against regulatory and execution hazards over the next 18 to 24 months.</p>",

Management highlighted strong cash generation, growing production and a fortified balance sheet, even as GAAP results were hit by large non‑cash impairments and weaker commodity realizations. The tone was confident about dividend durability and upside leverage to a future recovery, while candid on near‑term volatility and activity uncertainty.</p>\n<h2>Robust Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>Northern Oil and Gas reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion for 2025, with Q4 contributing $367 million, underscoring resilient profitability in a softer price environment. Full‑year free cash flow reached $424 million and Q4 generated $43 million, showing that the business continues to throw off meaningful cash even as commodity headwinds weigh on realized pricing.</p>\n<h2>Production Growth and Record Gas Volumes</h2>\n<p>Average daily production in Q4 climbed to 140,000 BOE per day, up 7% sequentially and 6% year over year, while full‑year volumes averaged 135,000 BOE per day, a 9% increase versus 2024. The Appalachian JV was a standout, with gas volumes hitting a third straight quarterly record at 392 MMcf per day, up 11% from Q3 and 24% from the prior year.</p>\n<h2>Ground Game Delivers Acreage Expansion</h2>\n<p>The company leaned on its non‑operated “ground game” to expand its footprint, adding more than 12,000 net acres in 2025 and ending the year with roughly 12,300 plus acres and 12.8 net wells. Q4 was a record quarter, with over 6,000 net acres and 1.2 net wells acquired across 33 deals, drawn from more than 700 evaluated opportunities, highlighting a highly selective but active acquisition engine.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Utica Deal Scales Appalachia</h2>\n<p>A centerpiece of the year was the integrated Utica acquisition alongside Infinity, anchored by assets operated by Antero. The transaction boosts Northern’s Appalachian footprint by about 45% on a pro forma basis to roughly 90,000 net acres and adds more than 100 identified gross locations, providing meaningful inventory depth and optionality across both upstream and midstream.</p>\n<h2>Liquidity Bolstered and Debt Ladder Extended</h2>\n<p>Management moved aggressively on the balance sheet, extending the revolving credit facility maturity from June 2027 to November 2030 while lifting the borrowing base to $1.975 billion and elected commitments to $1.8 billion. The company also issued $725 million of notes at 7.875%, retiring most of its 2028 notes and ending the year with more than $1 billion of liquidity following the Utica close.</p>\n<h2>Cost Efficiencies and Operational Improvements</h2>\n<p>Operationally, Northern continues to benefit from longer laterals and lower well costs, with normalized lateral lengths around 13,000 feet and normalized well costs down nearly 5% quarter over quarter. Lease operating expense improved in Q4 to $9.30 per BOE, a 5% reduction versus Q3 and 3% lower than Q4 2024, reflecting efficiency gains despite a challenging cost environment.</p>\n<h2>Disciplined Capital Allocation Across Basins</h2>\n<p>For 2025, total capital spending excluding non‑budgeted acquisitions came in at $1.0 billion, including $174 million devoted to the ground game. In Q4, CapEx excluding non‑budgeted deals totaled $270 million, with about 44% directed to the Permian, 26% to the Williston, 8% to the Uinta and 22% to Appalachia, and roughly $193 million going to organic development projects.</p>\n<h2>Dividend Resilience and Hedging Support</h2>\n<p>Management underscored that the dividend is designed to be sustainable even in a significantly weaker commodity backdrop, pointing to modest EBITDA growth despite lower prices. Adjusted EBITDA rose about 1% year over year even as average oil prices fell around 14% in 2025, a performance credited largely to effective hedging and disciplined capital allocation.</p>\n<h2>Non‑Cash Impairments Cloud GAAP Results</h2>\n<p>On the downside, reported GAAP earnings were heavily impacted by $703 million of non‑cash impairments recorded over 2025, including $270 million in Q4 alone. These write‑downs were tied to the full‑cost ceiling test and lower average oil prices, underlining how accounting rules can obscure underlying cash performance even when operations remain solid.</p>\n<h2>Weaker Realizations and Wider Differentials</h2>\n<p>Commodity realizations deteriorated, with oil differentials widening to $5.05 per barrel in Q4 from $3.89 in Q3 and averaging $5.53 for the year. Natural gas pricing was particularly pressured as realizations fell to 58% of benchmark in Q4 and averaged 79% for the year, down from 93% in 2024, driven by Waha weakness, softer NGL prices and unfavorable regional dynamics.</p>\n<h2>Oil Volumes Slip and Activity Visibility Declines</h2>\n<p>While total production grew, Q4 oil volumes of 75,000 barrels per day were up 3% sequentially but down 5% versus the prior year, reflecting mix and timing effects. Management flagged high uncertainty for 2026, citing deferred completions, operator curtailments and 13 net wells elected but not yet spud, which together introduce a wide range of possible activity outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Higher Maintenance Burden Lifts LOE</h2>\n<p>Despite efficiency gains late in the year, full‑year lease operating expense rose modestly to $9.61 per BOE, up 2% from 2024. The company attributed the increase to higher workover and maintenance costs associated with supporting growing volumes, highlighting that sustaining production across a broader asset base carries an incremental cost burden.</p>\n<h2>Share Price Pressure and Multiple Compression</h2>\n<p>Management acknowledged that shareholders did not fully benefit from the operational progress, as total equity returns were negative in 2025. The stock has suffered from multiple compression amid declining oil prices and broader market skepticism toward the sector, even as Northern improved its asset base, scale and cash generation capability.</p>\n<h2>Wide‑Range 2026 Guidance Signals Flexibility</h2>\n<p>For 2026, Northern issued a two‑case framework with low‑ and high‑activity scenarios covering production, operating costs and capital spending and assuming roughly 70 to 90 net wells. The program is anchored by about 45.6 net wells in process and 13 net wells elected but not yet spud, with a basin mix of around 40% Permian, 25% Appalachia, 25% Williston and 10% Uinta and well costs trending lower with 13,000‑foot laterals.</p>\n<h2>Forward‑Looking Outlook and Capital Optionality</h2>\n<p>Guidance suggests spending will be front‑loaded, with roughly 60% of CapEx in the first half while well activity remains roughly even, and Q1 typically slower before a Q2 ramp. In the low‑activity case, Northern expects lower oil volumes but materially reduced spending and significantly higher free cash flow at current strip, while the high‑activity case assumes fewer curtailments, more turn‑in‑lines and roughly a $100 to $150 million spending delta, with strong sensitivity to oil prices and ample liquidity to pursue either path.</p>\n<p>Northern Oil and Gas exits the year as a larger, more diversified and better‑funded non‑operator, yet one still exposed to commodity swings and operator timing. Investors are being asked to look past non‑cash impairments and near‑term pricing headwinds toward a flexible 2026 plan backed by strong liquidity, visible inventory and a dividend policy built to endure the downcycle and capture upside when conditions improve.</p>",

The company’s petrochemical cracker utilization rates in Brazil and South America fell versus both the prior quarter and 2024, largely due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Bahia complex, lower feedstock supply in São Paulo and demand-driven production adjustments.</p>\n<p>Resin sales in Brazil declined in 4Q25 compared with both the previous quarter and year-ago period, as higher inventories in the transformation chain, seasonal demand softness and a strategy to favor higher value-added sales reduced PE, PP and PVC volumes. Exports of resins dipped in the quarter but rose for the full year, supported by higher PE and PP shipments to South America after a 3% contraction in Brazilian market demand freed up product for export.</p>\n<p>Sales of main chemicals in Brazil were down sharply in 4Q25 from 3Q25 and 4Q24 and lower for 2025 as a whole, reflecting reduced availability of products like gasoline and paraxylene amid lower utilization rates and weaker demand for olefins and aromatics as clients optimized their operating rates. Chemical exports jumped in the quarter due to specific opportunities for paraxylene and benzene, but fell significantly for the year on reduced gasoline exports, U.S. tariffs on benzene and weaker toluene demand amid substitution in the domestic market.</p>\n<p>In the United States and Europe, Braskem faced lower polypropylene spreads in 4Q25 as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> expanded supply, while utilization rates declined due to scheduled maintenance in Europe, further weighing on regional performance. In Mexico, however, the company achieved its highest utilization rate since early 2017, driven by stable operations after a major 3Q25 maintenance shutdown and increased imported ethane availability, particularly from the Terminal Química Puerto México, supporting a stronger operational contribution from that segment.</p>\n<p>The company’s green ethylene operations saw utilization rates rebound sharply from 3Q25 after inventory optimization, though they remained below 4Q24 and full-year 2024 levels due to an unscheduled power-related shutdown earlier in 2025 and deliberate Green PE inventory adjustments.

Valuation is supportive due to the high dividend yield. Offsetting these positives are mixed-to-weak technical momentum signals and earnings-call risks tied to lower net income and higher financial costs, despite healthy EBITDA and leverage control.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on ELPC stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/elpc/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Companhia Paranaense de Energia Sponsored ADR</u></b></p>\n<p>Companhia Paranaense de Energia (Copel) is a Brazilian energy utility based in Curitiba, in the state of Paraná.
