            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Stag Industrial Inc.’s bylaws stipulate that certain legal actions initiated by stockholders must be brought in Maryland state courts or the United States District Court in Maryland, potentially limiting stockholders’ access to more favorable judicial forums. This exclusivity could deter stockholders from pursuing claims against the company or its representatives, as they might perceive these courts as less advantageous. While these provisions exclude federal securities law claims, they still impose significant constraints on where other disputes can be litigated. Consequently, this could reduce the frequency of lawsuits, potentially impacting stockholder rights and corporate governance oversight.</p>\n<p>The average STAG <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stag/forecast\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">stock price target</a></span> is $38.57, implying 0.08% upside potential.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Stag Industrial Inc’s risk factors, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stag/risk-factors\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>.</p>",
