The Novo Nordisk proposal, valued at approximately $9.1 billion, involves a two-step transaction where Novo Nordisk would initially pay $56.50 per Metsera common share in cash and later acquire the remaining shares, contingent on regulatory and shareholder approval. This proposal represents a significant premium over Metsera’s previous closing price and has prompted Metsera to notify Pfizer, triggering a negotiation period for potential adjustments to the Pfizer merger terms.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"MTSR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mtsr\">(MTSR)</a> stock is a Hold with a $54.00 price target.
