While total assets were broadly flat, equity attributable to shareholders rose 2.6%, as the company absorbed weaker module shipments, higher tariffs and manufacturing costs, partly offset by growing energy storage revenue and strategic prioritization of high-value markets amid an oversupplied, highly competitive PV sector.</p>\n<p>Management said 2025 performance was hit by lower module volumes, margin pressure and reduced non-recurring gains such as subsidies, even as energy storage backlogs moved into execution and monetization, supporting profitability. Against a continuing supply-demand imbalance and rising external uncertainties in the photovoltaic industry, CSI Solar pursued a “profit-first” strategy, optimizing shipment mix, focusing on key regions and long-term customers to maintain and expand market share, while warning that the figures, disclosed on February 28, 2026, are preliminary and subject to change once audited annual results are published.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CSIQ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/csiq\">(CSIQ)</a> stock is a Sell with a $20.00 price target.

Extended review periods, halted submissions during shutdowns, or uncertainty from ongoing leadership and policy changes could elevate development costs and postpone potential revenue generation.</p>\n<p>Given the recent mass layoffs of federal employees and the October 2025 U.S. government shutdown, the stability and capacity of the FDA to conduct timely reviews have become increasingly uncertain for Protagonist Therapeutics Inc. Any further erosion in FDA funding, staffing, or operational predictability may slow clinical trial progress and commercialization plans, adversely affecting the company’s overall business outlook and its ability to execute on strategic milestones.</p>\n<p>Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ptgx/forecast\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus rating</a></span> on PTGX stock based on 9 Buys.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Protagonist Therapeutics Inc’s risk factors, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ptgx/risk-factors\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>.</p>",
