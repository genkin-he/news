The company’s petrochemical cracker utilization rates in Brazil and South America fell versus both the prior quarter and 2024, largely due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Bahia complex, lower feedstock supply in São Paulo and demand-driven production adjustments.</p>\n<p>Resin sales in Brazil declined in 4Q25 compared with both the previous quarter and year-ago period, as higher inventories in the transformation chain, seasonal demand softness and a strategy to favor higher value-added sales reduced PE, PP and PVC volumes. Exports of resins dipped in the quarter but rose for the full year, supported by higher PE and PP shipments to South America after a 3% contraction in Brazilian market demand freed up product for export.</p>\n<p>Sales of main chemicals in Brazil were down sharply in 4Q25 from 3Q25 and 4Q24 and lower for 2025 as a whole, reflecting reduced availability of products like gasoline and paraxylene amid lower utilization rates and weaker demand for olefins and aromatics as clients optimized their operating rates. Chemical exports jumped in the quarter due to specific opportunities for paraxylene and benzene, but fell significantly for the year on reduced gasoline exports, U.S. tariffs on benzene and weaker toluene demand amid substitution in the domestic market.</p>\n<p>In the United States and Europe, Braskem faced lower polypropylene spreads in 4Q25 as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> expanded supply, while utilization rates declined due to scheduled maintenance in Europe, further weighing on regional performance. In Mexico, however, the company achieved its highest utilization rate since early 2017, driven by stable operations after a major 3Q25 maintenance shutdown and increased imported ethane availability, particularly from the Terminal Química Puerto México, supporting a stronger operational contribution from that segment.</p>\n<p>The company’s green ethylene operations saw utilization rates rebound sharply from 3Q25 after inventory optimization, though they remained below 4Q24 and full-year 2024 levels due to an unscheduled power-related shutdown earlier in 2025 and deliberate Green PE inventory adjustments. Overall, the data underscore how maintenance cycles, feedstock constraints and weaker global petrochemical fundamentals weighed on Braskem’s 2025 operating profile, while targeted export strategies and improved Mexican utilization provided partial offsets for stakeholders monitoring capacity use and market exposure.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"BAK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bak\">(BAK)</a> stock is a Hold with a $3.50 price target.

The amendment reduces interest margins on SOFR and base-rate loans by 50 basis points at each utilization level, updates commodity hedging covenants by raising certain utilization thresholds from 25% to 30%, adjusts lender schedules, and imposes customary post-closing mortgage and title delivery obligations, while leaving core facility terms such as commitments, collateral, covenants, and maturity unchanged.</p>\n<p>As of December 31, 2025, and February 27, 2026, PrimeEnergy had no outstanding borrowings, preserving full availability under the $115 million borrowing base.

The infrastructure is anchored by a 20-year lease with Telefónica, which currently uses only a small portion of the network’s 24 available fiber pairs, alongside capacity leased to Marcatel.</p>\n<p>In a February 27, 2026 announcement, Akanda and FTF outlined plans to expand leasing of this underutilized dark fiber network starting in 2026, aiming to add more tenants and boost recurring revenue with limited additional capital outlay. Management argues that the network’s scale, redundancy and available capacity position FTF as a key shared infrastructure provider for rising connectivity demand in Central Mexico, with potential implications for the region’s telecom competition and for Akanda’s long-term revenue mix.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Akanda Corp</u></b></p>\n<p>First Towers &amp; Fiber Corp. is an emerging telecommunications infrastructure developer in Mexico, focused on cellular tower construction and dark fiber networks. The company partners with national carriers and technology providers to deliver scalable, reliable connectivity solutions that support commercial growth and digital inclusion in fast-growing regional markets.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 1,376,505</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Sell</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> $1.85M</p>\n<p></p>",

Discovery entity holding the company’s Streaming &amp; Studios businesses, leaving WBD’s Global Linear Networks and certain other assets separated. This structure was designed to make the retained WBD streaming and studio operations a wholly owned Netflix subsidiary, supported by a package of committed bridge and term financing arrangements.</p>\n<p>However, on February 26, 2026, Warner Bros. Discovery notified Netflix that a revised offer from Paramount Skydance Corporation constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement. Netflix waived its right to negotiate changes, and on February 27, 2026, WBD terminated the deal with Netflix to sign a merger agreement with Paramount Skydance, triggering a $2.8 billion termination fee payable to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement on February 27, 2026, all related financing commitments arranged by Netflix, including a bridge commitment letter, incremental bridge facility, a 2025 revolving credit facility and a delayed draw term loan, were automatically canceled. These facilities had been intended to fund the proposed acquisition and associated costs, so their termination effectively unwinds the capital structure Netflix had put in place for the abandoned transaction.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"NFLX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx\">(NFLX)</a> stock is a Buy with a $120.00 price target.
