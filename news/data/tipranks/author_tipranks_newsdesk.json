Although the company posted a GAAP net loss of $42.6 million in Q4 2025, reflecting merger-related costs and non-cash expenses, it significantly improved profitability metrics with Adjusted EBITDA rising to $58.3 million, strengthened its balance sheet with $199 million in cash and no revolver borrowings, expanded its principal agent base by 19.4%, and continued to outperform the U.S. housing market in transaction and GTV growth while deepening adoption of its technology platform and integrating recent acquisitions, including Christie’s International Real Estate and the closed Anywhere transaction.</p>\n<p>Operationally in 2025, Compass drove 19.7% year-over-year growth in Q4 transactions versus a 0.7% increase for the broader U.S. market, lifted organic revenue and GTV by double digits, and maintained high agent retention at 96.8%. The company also advanced key platform offerings such as Compass One, Make-Me-Sell, One-Click Title &amp; Escrow and a new Buyer Demand Tool, which together increased client engagement and attach rates, underscoring a strategy of tightly linking technology, ancillary services, and disciplined cost control to enhance competitiveness and long-term value for agents and shareholders.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"COMP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/comp\">(COMP)</a> stock is a Buy with a $15.00 price target.

The board-approved change, which required no shareholder vote and leaves security holder rights and the CUSIP number unchanged, will see the stock begin trading on Nasdaq under the new ticker “FRMM” at the market open on March 2, 2026.</p>\n<p>In tandem with the rebrand, Forum launched a new corporate website on February 25, 2026, and framed the name change as the next step in its strategic evolution into an institutional-grade digital asset platform focused on tokenizing real-world, income-generating assets on <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd\">Ethereum</a>. Management emphasized that the new identity reflects the company’s role as a regulated bridge between traditional capital markets and blockchain-based infrastructure, underpinned by a multi-pronged revenue model and recent moves such as launching the Eurus Aero Token I and acquiring a portfolio of manufactured and modular home loans for future tokenization.</p>\n<p>The rebranding consolidates Forum’s positioning as it transitions from passively holding <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> assets to executing a broader tokenization strategy spanning sectors including auto loans, housing finance and aerospace equipment. For investors and institutional partners, the shift signals a more mature, infrastructure-centric business model aimed at defining market structure for on-chain finance and scaling access to tokenized real-world asset products.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"ETHZ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ethz\">(ETHZ)</a> stock is a Hold with a $4.00 price target.

The company structures cash-generating assets onto blockchain-based infrastructure to unlock liquidity, broaden investor access and improve primary issuance and secondary market efficiency for institutional participants.</p>\n<p>Forum integrates traditional asset management principles with scalable digital market architecture, positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based capital markets. Since launching in August 2025, it has built infrastructure, partnerships and asset pipelines across sectors such as auto loans, manufactured housing finance and aerospace equipment to support institutional-scale tokenization.</p>\n<p>The firm operates an economic model built around four revenue streams: yield on assets held prior to tokenization, origination fees on tokenized products, recurring asset management fees and potential transaction-based revenue from secondary trading. Through strategic equity investments in AI-driven credit and underwriting platforms and regulated distribution via partners like Liquidity.io, Forum aims to create a repeatable pipeline for tokenized investment products across multiple asset classes.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 772,505</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Sell</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> $65.59M</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",

Structured entirely as performance-based restricted stock units split evenly between relative total shareholder return and relative earnings per share goals versus the S&amp;P 500, the award features a five-year vesting period, above-market performance hurdles starting at the 40th percentile, and potential payouts ranging from 0% to 175% of target, tying Kohli’s long-term compensation tightly to CBRE’s comparative shareholder returns and earnings growth.</p>\n<p>The award’s rTSR portion will measure cumulative total shareholder return from February 25, 2026, to January 31, 2031, while the rEPS portion will track Core EPS growth against peers’ GAAP EPS growth from January 1, 2026, to December 31, 2030, with vesting occurring after performance certification but no later than February 25, 2031. By extending vesting to five years and requiring performance above median for enhanced payouts, CBRE is signaling a strong commitment to rigorous pay-for-performance alignment, executive retention and competitive positioning in the S&amp;P 500 peer set, potentially reassuring investors about long-term leadership stability and disciplined incentive design.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CBRE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cbre\">(CBRE)</a> stock is a Buy with a $180.00 price target.

The company also disclosed a maturity default on its $325 million JPM8 mortgage loan secured by eight hotels, while emphasizing that dispositions and potential handing back of assets could improve leverage and future capital needs, and reiterated that a special committee formed in early December 2025 is evaluating strategic alternatives to address the gap between the portfolio’s perceived value and the market price of its common stock.</p>\n<p>Operationally, Ashford reported that comparable hotel RevPAR fell 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2025 year-over-year, largely due to a federal government shutdown that began in October and drove a 27.9% decline in government-related room nights, with outsized impact on its Washington, D.C. exposure. Excluding the D.C. market, comparable RevPAR was flat and total revenue increased slightly, underscoring the company’s view that its ongoing asset sales, debt extensions, and performance initiatives are creating a leaner, more resilient portfolio despite constrained liquidity and continued industry uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AHT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht\">(AHT)</a> stock is a Hold with a $4.00 price target.

Technicals are modestly positive in the short term (price above 20/50-day averages and positive MACD), but valuation remains challenged due to negative earnings and no dividend yield data.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on AHT stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Ashford Hospitality</u></b></p>\n<p>Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. is a lodging real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels across the United States. The company focuses on actively managed hotel assets, working with third-party operators to drive revenue, optimize capital structure, and enhance shareholder value through portfolio repositioning and opportunistic asset sales.</p>\n<p>As of December 31, 2025, Ashford’s consolidated portfolio comprised 68 hotels with 16,500 net rooms, and its strategy includes performance improvement initiatives, balance-sheet deleveraging, and selective dispositions of non-core or capital-intensive properties. The REIT is highly exposed to markets with significant government and corporate demand, including Washington, D.C., and continues to navigate a challenging environment of negative industry RevPAR trends, elevated interest rates, and higher capital expenditure needs.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 190,015</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Sell</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> $18.91M</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",
