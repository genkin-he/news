            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Kellanova, a prominent player in the global snacking, international cereal, and North American frozen foods sectors, has released its third-quarter earnings for 2025. The company is currently involved in a pending acquisition by Mars, Incorporated, which is expected to close by the end of 2025. </p>\n<p>For the third quarter of 2025, Kellanova reported a slight increase in net sales, driven by growth in its noodles segment in Africa and favorable currency translation. However, the company faced a decline in operating profit and earnings per share due to decreased mark-to-market benefits and higher costs. Despite these challenges, adjusted operating profit saw a 7% increase, highlighting the company’s focus on innovation and emerging market expansion.</p>\n<p>Regionally, Kellanova experienced varied performance. North America saw a 3% decrease in net sales, while Europe and Latin America also faced declines. In contrast, the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA) region reported a 14% increase in net sales, driven by strong performance in the noodles and cereal segments. The company’s free cash flow for the year-to-date period was $320 million, down from $853 million in the previous year, primarily due to increased capital expenditures.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Kellanova remains committed to innovation and productivity, with a focus on expanding in emerging markets. The company is also working towards completing its merger with Mars, which is anticipated to usher in a new chapter of growth and opportunities.</p>",
