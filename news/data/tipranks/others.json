            "title": "The S&amp;P 500 Might Be Overheated, but Bank of America Sees Value in These 2 Stocks",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>While those gains are fostering an optimistic mood on Wall Street, some voices are counseling caution. Writing from Bank of America, strategist Savita Subramanian notes that there are bearish signals out there, and that investors should take care.</p>\n<p>“Our bear market signposts – the triggers that typically precede an S&amp;P 500 peak – suggest additional caution. Today, 60% of our signposts are triggered, just below the average of 70% before prior market peaks… Historical comparisons are problematic, as today’s S&amp;P is higher quality, asset light, less levered, etc. But risks are mounting and the valuation floor for the S&amp;P 500 is likely lower than today’s levels… Be selective,” Subramanian opined.</p>\n<p>That last line might be the key. Bank of America’s stock analysts are being selective – and they are selecting stocks where they still see value ahead. We’ve used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a> to look up the broader Wall Street view on two of these BofA picks. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p><strong>Doximity</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/docs/forecast\"><strong>DOCS</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with a look at Doximity, a professional networking platform oriented toward the medical field and health-care industry. Doximity’s core user base is physicians and other direct care providers, who can use the platform to connect with each other, follow medical news, communicate via a secure app that is considered HIPAA-compliant, and even contact patients via video call. The company points out that modern medicine is mobile – and it has designed its platform to facilitate mobility in ways that benefit clinicians and patients.</p>\n<p>Doximity bills itself as the largest online network for medical clinicians in the US healthcare sector. The company boasts that 80% of US physicians, as well as 50% of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are verified members of the network. By connecting them, with the ease and convenience of a mobile app, Doximity makes it easier for medical professionals to collaborate on patient care and to disseminate new developments in the field.</p>\n<p>The increase in demand for medical services over the past decade or more has forced providers to look for alternative ways to keep abreast of new developments, meet with patients, confer with specialists – and has expanded the field of telemedicine. The Doximity app, which allows providers to speak directly with patients via video link, streamlines the process. Providers can set online call appointments, tend to other work, and receive alerts as callers – patients or colleagues – enter the conversation.</p>\n<p>All of this requires a solid tech backing, and in August of this year Doximity announced that it had acquired Pathway Medical, a Canadian company that specializes in developing medical <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and evidence-based clinical reference systems. Doximity paid $36 million for Pathway, and the acquisition brings the Montreal-based firm’s physician-centered AI and datasets into Doximity’s suite of assets.</p>\n<p>On the financial side, Doximity reported results for fiscal 1Q26 this past August. The company kicked off its fiscal year with $145.9 million in revenue, a total that was up 15% year-over-year and came in $6.36 million ahead of the estimates. The company had a quarterly non-GAAP EPS of 36 cents, up from 28 cents one year earlier – and a nickel better than the forecast. Doximity also reported a 52% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, to $60.1 million.</p>\n<p>Bank of America analyst Allen Lutz sees a shift in the healthcare industry as a net gain for Doximity. He notes that regulatory reforms are promoting ad spending toward provider channels – and that Doximity is perfectly positioned to reap gains from that trend. Lutz says of the company, “The FDA’s recent reforms to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising are adding friction in that channel, and pharmaceutical manufacturers are beginning to shift spend away from the DTC channel and toward the healthcare provider (HCP) channel. The combination of recent manufacturer decisions (Alnylam) and this quarter’s survey results gives us confidence that Doximity’s 4Q’25 budget flush will be significantly above Street expectations and that revenue growth can potentially accelerate in CY26. We see substantial upside revision risk with the Street currently expecting a three year revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 11%/12%, respectively.”</p>\n<p>These comments support Lutz’s Buy rating on DOCS, while his $82 price target suggests that the stock will gain ~24.5% by this time next year. (To watch Lutz’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/allen-lutz\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, the Moderate Buy consensus rating on Doximity shares is based on 17 reviews that include 10 to Buy, 5 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The stock is currently trading for $65.82, and its $71.38 average target price implies a one-year gain of 8.5%.

            "title": "Insiders Are Snapping Up These 2 Stocks — and Analysts Like What They See",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>We don’t mean anything nefarious by ‘insiders’; they’re corporate officers whose positions make them responsible for ensuring company profits and shareholder returns – and also give them a deep view into the inner workings of their companies, along with early knowledge of just what effect those workings will have on share prices.</p>\n<p>All of that is just to say that insiders could have a better idea than the rest how their own firms’ stocks are likely to move – and they do trade shares on that knowledge. To keep the playing field level, regulatory authorities require that insiders publish their trading activities, and investors can follow those published trades, using them for market signals.</p>\n<p>We’ve used the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-insider-trading-stocks\">Insiders’ Hot Stocks</a> tool at TipRanks to look up the details on two stocks that the insiders love right now. These are stocks that are seeing recent multi-million-dollar insider buys – and they have also attracted upbeat ratings from the Street’s analysts. So, let’s give these names a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>Summit Therapeutics</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smmt/forecast\"><strong>SMMT</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we’ll look at is Summit Therapeutics, a biopharma company operating at the late clinical stage. Summit is studying the drug candidate ivonescimab as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of various types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The company is working with ivonescimab under a license agreement with the Chinese drug company Akeso; under the agreement, Summit has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan.</p>\n<p>The drug candidate, ivonescimab, is a new tetravalent molecule that brings together two oncological mechanisms that have already been validated. The drug is a first-in-class agent, described as an advanced PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody. It is designed to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment while avoiding healthy tissue. NSCLC, the disease target of Summit’s current clinical trials, is the most common type of lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Currently, Summit is studying ivonescimab in the HARMONi, HARMONi-3, and HARMONi-7 trials. These trials are investigating the drug, respectively, as a second-line treatment for advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC; as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC; and as a first-line treatment for metastatic PD-L1 high (≥50%) NSCLC. We should also note that, on October 17, Summit announced that it is starting the HARMONi-GI3 study, the first global Phase 3 trial of ivonescimab to look beyond NSCLC. The new study, planned to start in the US before the end of this year, will focus on using ivonescimab to treat colorectal cancer, and total enrollment is planned for approximately 600 patients.</p>\n<p>Summit has recently reported positive results for ivonescimab from the HARMONi trial, and based on those results, the company has plans to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA during 4Q25. The company has also announced an update to the HARMONi-3 trial, under which it will release split analyses of ivonescimab, evaluating the drug plus chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with squamous NSCLC and in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Summit states that enrollment in the HARMONi-3 and -7 trials remains ongoing.</p>\n<p>Turning to the company’s insiders, we find that several top-level corporate officers have made recent stock buys. Co-CEOs Maky Zanganeh and Robert Duggan each purchased 26,680 shares of the stock, paying approximately $500,000 each, while Board member Xia Yu spent nearly $10 million to pick up 533,617 shares. All three of these purchases were made on October 21 and totaled just under $11 million.</p>\n<p>For Citizens JMP analyst Reni Benjamin, there are two key points for investors to consider regarding Summit: the company’s extensive late-stage clinical trials and its deep pockets. Benjamin writes, “Ivonescimab’s efficacy across all subgroups, unconstrained by PD-L1 TPS, underscores its versatility in the first-line NSCLC setting. In our opinion, the superiority demonstrated over tisle&nbsp;is particularly meaningful given that one should be able to extrapolate across other checkpoint inhibitor approved indications… With more than 40,000 patients treated with ivo (3,000 in clinical trials and the remainder commercially, based on our conversation with management), potential HARMONi-2 OS data by YE25/early 2026, multiple Phase 3 trials ongoing, an accomplished team at the helm, and a strong cash position of $297.9MM, we continue to view shares as attractively valued, and we would consider any near-term weakness as an additional buying opportunity.”</p>\n<p>These comments back up the analyst’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on SMMT shares, while his $40 price target suggests that the stock will gain 114% in the next 12 months. (To watch Benjamin’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/reni-benjamin\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Summit has a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s stock experts, based on 14 reviews that include 10 to Buy, 1 to Hold, and 3 to Sell. The shares are priced at $18.66, and their $30.92 average price target implies a one-year gain of 66%.

            "title": "Wells Fargo Says These 2 Utility Stocks Are Among Its ‘Best Ideas’ for the Rest of 2025",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In addition, most utility firms operate in tightly regulated markets and effectively hold monopolies within their regions. For investors, that means a key determinant of performance isn’t the going rate for services, but rather the company’s relationship with its regulatory authority. Maintain that relationship on solid footing, and the firm will remain well-positioned to appeal to investors.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo’s Shar Pourreza, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 2% of Wall Street’s analysts, has been giving this sector a long, hard look as 2025 winds toward its close, and he sees utility stocks as sound options for the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>“We continue to see the sector as discounted vs. its emerging growth attributes/opportunities, including data centers, reshoring, electrification of the system, and other economically driven load growth opportunities. In short, this is one of the strongest backdrops we have seen in the sector, which is not only leveraged to perpetual infrastructure needs, but is now further buoyed by one of the healthiest load growth environments we have seen in more than 20 years of covering this space… The defensive characteristics for the group merely create a floor, limiting downside, but the perfect storm of tailwinds creates materially higher upside opportunities,” Pourreza opined.</p>\n<p>With that bullish setup in mind, Pourreza isn’t just speaking in general terms – he pinpoints two utility stocks as his ‘best ideas’ for the rest of the year. But do his top picks align with the broader Wall Street consensus? We turned to the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to find out. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p><strong>Sempra Energy</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sre/forecast\"><strong>SRE</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first energy stock we’ll look at here, Sempra Energy, is an electric and natural gas utility operating in California and Texas. The San Diego-based company was founded in 1998 and today is one of the largest utility-scale energy networks in North America, with approximately 40 million customers. Sempra has some 20,000 employees and boasted nearly $100 billion in total assets at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>Sempra has three main operating divisions: Sempra California, Sempra Texas, and Sempra Infrastructure. In the first, the company’s two utilities, SD&amp;E and SoCalGas, serve some 25 million customers in the southern and central parts of the state, providing electricity and natural gas. The company takes a proactive stance on grid resiliency, understanding that power supplies must be reliable. In addition, Sempra is a leader in bringing renewable energy sources into the distribution network.</p>\n<p>Looking at Sempra Texas, we find that the company operates through Oncor Electric Delivery Company. Oncor, headquartered in Dallas, is a regulated electric transmission and distribution company, with more than 143,000 miles of total electric lines in commission. Oncor is one of the largest transmission and distribution companies operating in Texas and serves some 13 million customers across 120 counties.</p>\n<p>The Sempra Infrastructure division has a more global focus and includes a portfolio of liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets with approximately 40 million tons capacity per year under construction on the Pacific and Gulf coasts. This division focuses on bringing LNG into the North American utility network and includes more than 4,500 miles of natural gas transport and distribution pipelines. The division’s other work involves operating cross-border projects between the US and Mexico. These include solar and wind power projects, as well as battery storage.</p>\n<p>In September of this year, Sempra announced several strategic actions designed to advance the company’s corporate strategy and to bring cash reserves into its coffers. At the center of these actions is the sale of 45% of Sempra Infrastructure Partners to the global investment firm KKR for $10 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the middle of next year, with the full cash balance to be paid seven years after the closing.</p>\n<p>Turning to the company’s financial results, we find that Sempra’s last report, covering 2Q25, showed revenue of $3 billion. This figure was relatively flat year-over-year but missed the forecast by nearly $124 million. At the bottom line, Sempra’s non-GAAP EPS of 89 cents was also the same as the prior-year quarter – and it beat the forecast by 4 cents per share.</p>\n<p>Pourreza, in his comments on Sempra, notes the company’s potential earnings strengths and its bullish catalysts in the making.</p>\n<p>“Best Idea Regulated Utility… We would be buyers ahead of a key reset in February, especially given current valuation levels, with 7-9% EPS growth unlikely to step back down to 6-8% (i.e., the long-term EPS trajectory is to exceed prior 6-8% guidance),” Pourreza said. “We are very bullish on the outlook for Oncor, especially on the heels of key legislative initiatives that passed, have very little concerns around the CA utilities and believe the recent deal with KKR was banner, as it not only supports growth (still with 25% exposure with SIP) and the balance sheet, but it mitigates risk, which all investors were seeking, by deconsolidating SIP from SRE,”.</p>\n<p>The analyst goes on to put an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, with a $115 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Pourreza’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/shahriar-pourreza\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Moderate Buy consensus rating on Sempra is based on 13 recent analyst recommendations that include 9 Buys and 4 Holds. The shares are currently priced at $92.55, and their $96.92 average target price implies a 5% gain in the coming year.

            "title": "J.P. Morgan Sees Over 50% Upside Ahead for These 2 Gold Stocks",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Mounting fiscal deficits, simmering geopolitical risks, and doubts about long-term currency stability have rekindled demand for the metal. With central banks hoarding bullion and investors looking to diversify portfolios heavy with risk assets, gold has re-emerged as a trusted hedge against potential policy missteps and future turbulence.</p>\n<p>That backdrop hasn’t gone unnoticed on Wall Street. At J.P. Morgan, Natasha Kaneva, Head of Global Commodities Strategy, remains firmly bullish on the precious metal, calling gold the bank’s “highest conviction long for the year.” The strategist expects the ongoing shift toward a Fed rate-cutting cycle to provide further upside, projecting prices to climb from $4,131 per ounce today to $5,055 by the fourth quarter of 2026.</p>\n<p>But you don’t actually need to hold gold to participate in this rally. Patrick Jones, J.P. Morgan’s lead analyst for gold stocks, argues that another way to ride the wave is through miners themselves. He’s particularly upbeat on two gold mining stocks that he believes could deliver gains of 50% or more.</p>\n<p>Are other analysts in agreement? We’ve dived into the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to find out.</p>\n<p><strong>AngloGold Ashanti</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au/forecast\"><strong>AU</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first gold miner that we’ll look at here is AngloGold Ashanti, a company that was formed in 2004 through the merger of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation with AngloGold. In the two decades since then, the company has built itself into one of the world’s major gold producers – and perennial member of the top ten gold firms by numerous measures: #8 by market cap ($34.6 billion), #7 by revenue ($7.64 billion in the last four quarters), and #4 by earnings ($3.02 billion in the last four quarters).</p>\n<p>The company has supported this strong performance with large-scale gold production. In 2024, AngloGold Ashanti’s total production came to 2.66 million ounces of gold, along with 3.75 million ounces of silver, its main metal by-product. The company’s largest operations are in Africa, where it has six active mining operations employing nearly 28,000 people. The company’s African ops produced 1.56 million ounces of gold last year and have a mineral reserve of more than 20 million ounces.</p>\n<p>AngloGold Ashanti’s next largest set of operations, by output, is in Australia, where the company has two mines that generated 572,000 ounces of gold last year and have reserves of 2.32 million ounces. The Australian operations employ more than 1,700 workers. Finally, in the Americas, where AngloGold Ashanti employs some 8,500 people, the company produced 526,000 ounces of gold from three active mines. The firm’s American holdings boast a gold reserve of 6.3 million ounces.</p>\n<p>A key factor for investors to consider when looking at gold mining companies is the cost of production as it relates to the cost of the metal. As noted above, gold is currently selling for over $4,100 per ounce and is expected to rise higher. AngloGold Ashanti’s production costs run between $1,000 and $1,300 per ounce, in US currency, giving the company a comfortable difference between production and sales costs. We should note here that shares in AngloGold Ashanti are up a huge 209% for the year-to-date.</p>\n<p>In its last reported quarter, which covered 2Q25, this company reported sales of $2.44 billion, a figure that was up 77% year-over-year and beat the forecast by approximately $90 million. At the bottom line, the company’s $1.25 non-GAAP EPS was more than double the 2Q24 result, although it missed the forecast by 4 cents per share. In another metric of interest to investors, the company reported a 149% year-over-year increase in its free cash flow, which reached $535 million in 2Q25.</p>\n<p>The company’s free cash flow supports its dividend policy, which AngloGold Ashanti has been increasing in recent years. The company started paying out annual dividends in 2019, moved to semiannual in 2021, and to quarterly just this year. In August of this year, the company declared an interim dividend for Q2 of 80 cents per share, which included the regular dividend payout of 12.5 cents. As well as increasing the frequency of dividend payouts in recent years, the company has also been increasing the amounts paid.</p>\n<p>Overall sound production, a valuable acquisition plan, and a potentially lucrative dividend policy caught the attention of JPM’s Patrick Jones, who says of this major gold miner, “AngloGold still Top Pick on valuation, buyback potential, &amp; Nevada upside. We forecast ANG to return ~4% of mkt cap by Feb’26, solely based on its FCF-based dividend policy. However, with ~$0.7bn net cash (~2% of market cap) forecast at Q4’25, we see potential for additional excess capital distributions beyond the dividend policy. We think share buybacks are now a realistic tool available to management and we have no record of a SBB in &gt;15 years. The recent Augusta Gold acquisition in Nevada further consolidates ANG’s regional footprint, complimenting its North Bullfrog and Arthur projects. North Bullfrog is at pre-feasibility stage, but with &gt;16Moz of total resources, ANG’s Nevada district offers significant value upside potential.”</p>\n<p>Along with Top Pick status, the 5-star analyst gives AU shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating, and a $128 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 87%. (To watch Jones’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/patrick-jones\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>AngloGold Ashanti has earned a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 recent reviews that include 4 to Buy and 2 to Sell. The shares are priced at $68.57, and their $80.56 average price target implies a gain for the coming year of 17.5%.

            "title": "These Are the 2 Reasons Behind J.P. Morgan’s Upgrade of Coinbase Stock",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>That is the reasoning behind a change to J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Worthington’s COIN model. The analyst has upgraded his rating from Neutral to Overweight (i.e., Buy) while also raising his price target from $342 to $404, implying the stock will gain 17% over the coming year. (To watch Worthington’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/ken-worthington\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>So, what are these “emerging monetization opportunities” Worthington is excited about? Well, for one, Coinbase is reportedly exploring the launch of a Base token – a move that could “generate significant value.” Base, Coinbase’s proprietary Layer 2 blockchain introduced in August 2023, has quickly become one of the biggest L2 by several metrics. So far, Coinbase has monetized Base through sequencer fees, but Worthington thinks there’s an opportunity for Coinbase to “equitize Base via a token.”</p>\n<p>A Base token, says the analyst, would benefit both shareholders and the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a> community by encouraging ecosystem development, boosting engagement, and supporting infrastructure growth. Based on current TVL (total value locked) and revenue, Worthington sees room for a sizable market cap in the $12 billion to $34 billion range, supported by “lofty token economics.” While most tokens would likely be distributed among developers, validators, and the Base community, the analyst expects Coinbase to keep a portion for itself, potentially generating $4 billion to $12 billion over time.</p>\n<p>The other opportunity has to do with “experimenting with USDC rewards.” Worthington sees Coinbase testing different USDC yields, both to encourage more adoption of Coinbase One and to generate more revenue from USDC held on its platform. Although USDC deposits generate a 100% gross margin for Coinbase, Worthington estimates operating margins are at 10–20%, with recent quarters likely showing some improvement.</p>\n<p>Coinbase could potentially attract more users to Coinbase One, which provides subscription-based trading fees along with other perks, including a higher yield on USDC. The platform currently provides a 4% yield to members compared with 0% for non-subscribers, effectively making the subscription worthwhile for accounts holding around $1,500 in USDC. Through this segmentation strategy, Worthington believes Coinbase could add up to $1.00 in incremental annual earnings per user at the outset, though he eventually sees a “less extreme outcome.”</p>\n<p>While Worthington is “incrementally more positive” about Coinbase’s position in the crypto ecosystem, he highlights the ongoing risks noted by investors, particularly regarding competition and pricing, with concerns including both fee compression and potential market share declines. However, he still thinks Coinbase’s value proposition is unique. “While we see the potential for prices to come down over time, we see Coinbase vertical integration and its operations as a broker, a market maker, and exchange and a custodian as supporting profitability even as pricing in US cash equities has gone towards zero for many equity-focused brokers,” Worthington summed up. “We see Coinbase better positioned than peers focused in different asset classes.”</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the Street, COIN claims an additional 13 Buys, 10 Holds and 2 Sells, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $385.33 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for an 11.5% premium. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/coin/forecast\">See COIN stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "title": "Meta Stock: Truist Takes a Positive Stance Ahead of Q3 Earnings",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the print, Truist analyst Youssef Squali points out that year-to-date, META has outperformed his covered stocks, rising 25% compared with a 22% gain for the firm’s Truist Securities Internet Index and 14% for the S&amp;P 500. “It remains one of our favorite names, driven by <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> improvements unlocking better ranking and recommendation models, which is helping improve targeting and ad efficiency, and drive spend on the platform,” the analyst went on to say. “Higher monetization of Threads and WhatsApp should help sustain growth, and we see materially higher contribution from AR/VR products with strength from the Ray-Ban (EssilorLuxottica, ESLOY, NR) initiative.”</p>\n<p>As for the Q3 results, Squali expects revenue will be in line with or slightly above his and Street expectations, with total revenue growth of 22% year-over-year, near the high end of the guide of $47.5-$50.5 billion. This would match Meta’s FX-neutral YoY growth of 22% in 2Q25, and improve on the 19% growth seen in 3Q24 (+20% FX-neutral). Squali’s estimate incorporates a 1ppt FX tailwind, which might be conservative, as the analyst thinks FX could provide roughly a 140bps benefit for the quarter.</p>\n<p>With AI shaping the narrative these days, during the quarter, there were several announcements and reports of new partnerships, potential acquisitions, and infrastructure initiatives the company is taking to “accelerate its AI progress.” On the partnership front, Meta entered multi-year agreements with Arm Holdings, Google Cloud, and CoreWeave, committing up to $14.2 billion with CoreWeave through 2031. Regarding acquisitions, Meta is reportedly set to acquire chip startup Rivos (according to Reuters), which would help its efforts to develop in-house <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> capabilities for AI. Additionally, Meta is investing in new data center expansions to advance its AI roadmap, including the Hyperion campus and a new $1.5 billion facility in Texas, representing the company’s 29th global data center.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Q4 guide, the company faces a challenging YoY comp. With revenue growth of 21% in 4Q24 amid “macro uncertainty,” Squali expects management to provide guidance in line with consensus for 4Q25, with revenue at $57.2 billion (+18% YoY). Growth in 4Q24 had accelerated sequentially due to stronger ad pricing and e-commerce performance. Consequently, the analyst sees total revenue growth of 19% in 2025.</p>\n<p>All told, Squali maintained a Buy rating on the shares and raised his price target from $800 to $900, implying the stock will gain 23% in the months ahead. (To watch Squali’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/youssef-squali\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>That’s also the prevalent view among Squali’s colleagues; based on a mix of 40 Buys vs. 6 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy. Going by the $877.57 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 20% premium. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">See Meta stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "title": "Amazon Stock: KeyBanc Looks at the Key Debates and Takes a Bullish Stance",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>This, says KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson, has “elevated the debate” about how the shift affects <strong>Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast\">NASDAQ:AMZN</a>)</strong> AWS’s position as an industry leader. “More specifically,” Patterson went on to say, “we believe AWS is viewed as a laggard in managing gen-<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> workloads while its competitors are taking market share.”</p>\n<p>Patterson’s take is that AWS’s perceived loss of market share is partly due to industry-wide bottlenecks like power and capacity, which hit its large, high-capacity operations harder. Despite this, AWS continues to grow by “absolute revenue dollars” near or above competitor levels, and initiatives like gigawatt-scale data centers (Project Rainier) and partnerships with customers such as Anthropic could boost revenue further in 2026. “In short,” the analyst adds, “we would be surprised if AWS was left behind in the AI revolution.”</p>\n<p>Patterson concedes he could be wrong about this due to companies like Anthropic pursuing multi-cloud strategies – it has worked with Google Cloud since 2023 and could be signing a new deal – which, if widely adopted, could shift “market share dynamics.” Additionally, debate continues over how Amazon’s Trainium chips compare to GPUs or Google’s TPUs. While AWS emphasizes choice by offering both GPUs and ASICs, Patterson thinks limited adoption of Trainium could raise questions about the effectiveness of its AI strategy.</p>\n<p>That’s one key debate, and another one centers around the potential impact of the off-platform advertising strategy. Amazon DSP allows brands to run ads both on and off its platforms, including CTV, audio, and display. While Amazon mainly earns from ads on its own platforms – Amazon.com, Prime Video, and Twitch – it has recently expanded third-party advertising partnerships. This has led to discussion about the size of the off-platform opportunity and its potential impact on overall advertising growth.</p>\n<p>Patterson’s view here is that off-platform advertising is an “evolution” of Google’s approach, with most revenue still coming from first-party channels. Amazon’s advantage lies in its unique data access, positioning off-platform ads as an “incremental contributor to advertising growth,” while Amazon.com sponsored listings and Prime Video remain the primary revenue sources.</p>\n<p>Looking at the potential negatives, the key issue is scale; Patterson finds it unlikely that Amazon’s third-party advertising will surpass revenue from its owned platforms. Weak growth could result from the DSP failing to gain traction beyond e-commerce brands or Amazon allocating fewer resources to this business over time.</p>\n<p>The last key debate revolves around how much the grocery business will drive North America growth. Patterson sees Amazon and Walmart gaining share as smaller, less tech-enabled grocers lose ground. By the end of the year, Amazon will have expanded same-day perishables delivery from 1,000 to over 2,300 U.S. cities, while Walmart targets reaching 95% of households within three hours. Amazon’s recent grocery investments are likely to generate incremental industry share gains. Grocery is critical – eight of the top 10 U.S. retailers offer it – highlighting its importance. Since launching in 2011, Amazon’s grocery offerings have evolved to include Amazon.com, Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and partnerships, with e-commerce grocery and delivery continuing to grow in significance.</p>\n<p>So, what does all this ultimately mean for investors? After considering all the above, Patterson resumed coverage of AMZN stock with an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating backed by a $300 price target. This figure factors in a one-year gain of 36%. (To watch Patterson’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-patterson\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Amazon gets the backing of every analyst to have reviewed its prospects over the past 3 months. The 41 Buys naturally all add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 22%, considering the average target clocks in at $269.03.

            "title": "Intel Stock: Rich Valuation and Length of Turnaround Keep Needham on the Sidelines",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The company beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. Indicating a rebound in demand for its core x86 PC processors, revenue rose by 3.2% year-over-year to $13.7 billion, surpassing consensus by $560 million. Within that total, Data Center and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> revenue reached $4.12 billion, down 1% from the prior year but ahead of the $3.97 billion analysts had anticipated.</p>\n<p>Adj. gross margin came in at 40%, topping the Street’s 36% forecast. The margin improvement was driven by higher revenue, a more favorable product mix, and reduced inventory reserves – helped by sales of previously written-down stock – partly offset by increased Lunar Lake volumes and the initial ramp-up of Intel 18A. The end result was adj. EPS of $0.23, $0.22 above Street expectations.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Intel expects Q4 revenue of about $13.3 billion at the midpoint and adj. EPS of $0.08, roughly matching analysts’ expectations of $13.37 billion in revenue and $0.08 in EPS. The company noted that this outlook does not include the impact of its recent sale of the Altera subsidiary.</p>\n<p>Scanning the results, Needham’s Quinn Bolton, an analyst ranked among the top 1% of stock experts on Wall Street, highlights several key takeaways. Product mix is expected to be the largest “swing factor” in future gross margin changes, as the company manages demand for its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake products while reallocating older-node capacity to data center customers to better support its PC partners. Meanwhile, the absence of Altera is expected to create roughly a 1% headwind in 2026. Capacity is likely to remain tight, particularly in the Data Center and AI segment, where wafer supply will be prioritized but still fall short of overall demand. Additionally, the analyst points out the company has formed a new Central Engineering Group to spearhead its upcoming ASIC initiatives.</p>\n<p>So, investors are evidently happy with the print, but Bolton’s overall conclusion in not quite as enthusiastic. “We continue to believe Intel’s turnaround will take time as the company is losing share in DC and is not yet competitive in AI. As valuation is rich, we remain Hold rated,” the 5-star analyst summed up. Bolton has no fixed price target in mind. (To watch Bolton’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/quinn-bolton\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Street, as a whole, does have one, and it concludes the shares are overvalued; at $29.35, the figure sits 23% below the current share price. Most analysts are also sitting this one out for now; the stock’s Hold consensus rating is based on 24 Holds, 6 Sells and 2 Buys.

            "title": "Needham Sees Opportunity in 2 Lesser-Known Energy Stocks Riding the Data-Center Boom",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>At the heart of this construction wave are the world’s largest tech firms, whose AI ambitions are driving unprecedented levels of capital spending. Companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are pouring record amounts into data center construction to power their AI and cloud computing goals. Their combined spending reached about $245 billion last year and is now approaching $360 billion.</p>\n<p>Data centers are extraordinarily power-hungry, consuming around 415 TWh last year, with forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggesting that figure could reach 945 TWh by 2030, making them a central force behind rising global electricity demand. Much of that power goes toward cooling and climate control systems essential for maintaining stable operations.</p>\n<p>Covering the energy sector for Needham, analyst Sean Milligan points to two lesser-known energy stocks that stand to gain as data centers multiply and the demand for reliable power infrastructure accelerates.</p>\n<p>Do other analysts share his optimism? We turned to the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to find out.</p>\n<p><strong>Generac Holdings (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gnrc/forecast\"><strong>GNRC</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>First up is Generac, a company that provides ‘total energy solutions,’ enabling people and businesses to personalize their energy use. More specifically, Generac provides energy technology and solutions, including power generation equipment, energy storage systems, energy management devices, and other specialized power products to a wide range of customers in the light commercial, industrial, and residential markets. The company has been in business since 1959, and today is a $10 billion-plus player in the power generation segment and a leader in North America’s generator market.</p>\n<p>Generac’s power solutions have applications in several areas, including portable power, home backup, solar power storage, and EV charging. The common denominator is demand for either off-grid power or reliable backups to grid power; in every case, Generac’s products are designed to ensure that the essential electricity continues to flow under any conditions. The company conducts its sales under an array of brand names and boasts that it is the top name in home backup generators.</p>\n<p>On the industrial side, Generac’s products support everything from microgrid local power supplies to specific industrial needs such as telecom, water infrastructure, and – of course – data centers. Reliable and sustainable power is necessary for data centers, and Generac provides a wide range of industrial-strength diesel-powered generators capable of meeting high power demands in the data center segment.</p>\n<p>This company’s last set of financial results covered 2Q25 and showed a top line of $1.06 billion. This figure was up 6% year-over-year, and it beat the forecast by just under $35 million. Generac had a net income of $74 million in the quarter, or $1.25 per share in GAAP measures; this beat the forecast by 22 cents per share.</p>\n<p>Needham’s Sean Milligan notes that Generac’s recent gains – the stock spiked as much as 29% in the days after the 2Q25 earnings release – are tied to the data center business and sees that as the key to the stock going forward.</p>\n<p>“We think shares began trading on the data-center thematic after 2Q25 results (August 2025), when management publicly framed the $5B+ opportunity; we see further upside with execution (award announcements and pipeline-to-backlog conversion)… We see margin quality improving through 2026–2027 as data-center volumes ramp and the energy-technology drag eases… We assume $250MM of data-center revenue in 2026 at ~17.5% adjusted EBITDA, scaling toward a ~$500MM run-rate in 2027; lead times and service coverage are key differentiators. Data-center revenue could scale quickly, driving revenue and margin upside vs. our model,” Milligan opined.</p>\n<p>Quantifying this stance, the analyst puts a Buy rating on GNRC shares, along with a $248 price target that implies a potential upside for the year ahead of 31%. (To watch Milligan’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sean-milligan\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Generac has earned a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 16 recent reviews with a split of 8 Buys and Holds, each. The shares are priced at $189.04, and their $207.14 average target price suggests that the shares will gain 9.5% by this time next year.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>By some estimates, well over 90% of businesses globally are using cloud services of some sort. For the rest of us, the cloud makes possible a wide range of daily activities, including GPS navigation, smart home technology, mobile data usage – even high-end sewing machines can be connected to access online patterns. Cloud technology makes possible the flexibility and scalability that eases our path through modern life.</p>\n<p>The analysts at Morgan Stanley understand this and are picking out cloud-related stocks that deserve investor interest. Specifically, firm analyst Elizabeth Porter, in her coverage of the cloud sector, sees two cloud stocks that are presenting compelling entry points.</p>\n<p>We’ve opened up the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks database</a> to get a closer look at both of them; according to the data, both have Buy ratings from the Street and double-digit upside potential. Here are the details.</p>\n<p><strong>Twilio, Inc.</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/twlo/forecast\"><strong>TWLO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we’ll look at is Twilio, a tech firm involved in cloud computing and software, particularly in the communications field. Twilio offers its enterprise clients a customer engagement platform that supports a wide range of communication tools, including messaging, email, and voice channels, as well as customer data analytics and identity authentication for anti-fraud security.</p>\n<p>Twilio’s platform is designed to let its customers build what they need, on the basic framework. Developers, marketers, data engineers, and sales teams can all find the tools necessary for effective customer contacts and communications management. Twilio has been integrating <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> tools into the platform, in the form of conversational AI that enhances human interactions instead of replacing them. The AI can provide automated customer support, can assist agents during and after customer calls, and can analyze support center data.</p>\n<p>In short, Twilio’s cloud-based communications system offers a full array of tools that cover all aspects of B2C contacts. The company aims to streamline the communications flow, allowing businesses to improve their contact procedures with personalized tools that meet the needs of both companies and clients, while creating advantages with AI-powered data analysis.</p>\n<p>All of this has allowed Twilio to take a leading position in its niche, in a short time. The company was founded in 2008, just 17 years ago, but today is a $17 billion tech innovator that generated $4.46 billion in total revenue last year. For the first half of this year, the company’s revenue total, $2.24 billion, was up 15% year-over-year. The company’s last set of quarterly results, from 2Q25, showed $1.23 billion at the top line, for a 13% year-over-year increase and beating the forecast by $40 million. The $1.19 quarterly non-GAAP EPS in Q2 was 14 cents per share better than had been anticipated.</p>\n<p>In her coverage of Twilio for Morgan Stanley, analyst Porter restates her belief that the company is a leader in its field – and more importantly, that it has plenty of room for continued growth.</p>\n<p>“We continue to see TWLO as best positioned within communication software, remaining confident on path towards DD% growth on the back of improved GTM and cross sell initiatives. While gross margin noise has weighed on the name, Q2 results provided further confidence in the path to improving growth, during which the company’s Comms business saw its 4th consecutive quarter of&nbsp;acceleration. On Q3 results, we expect 200-300bps of upside to organic (ex-surcharges) Comms revenue (implying ~11.5% Y/Y growth), passed through to 4Q/ FY25, with 4Q revenue guidance coming in closer to 8% (vs. consensus of ~7.5%). Given valuation of ~16.5x EV/’26e FCF, we do not believe this expected upside has been priced in,” Porter opined.</p>\n<p>Quantifying her stance, Porter rates TWLO as Overweight (i.e., Buy), with a $152 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Porter’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/elizabeth-porter\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Twilio gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 19 recent reviews that include 14 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. The stock is currently trading for $109.41, and its average target price of $132.47 suggests a gain of 21% in the coming year.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Stocks can fall in price for all sorts of reasons – but that doesn’t mean investors should necessarily avoid them. Wall Street’s analysts are quick to point out shares that retain their fundamental soundness, even if their prices have fallen.</p>\n<p>We’ve looked into the data on the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a> to find two stocks that are showing sharp losses in recent months – they’re both down more than 40% in 2025 – but that also have solid ratings from the analysts. Let’s give them a closer look, and find out why Wall Street’s analysts are recommending these stocks now they are flirting with bottom-level prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Klaviyo, Inc.</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/kvyo/forecast\"><strong>KVYO</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>We’ll start with a look at Klaviyo, the B2C CRM software company that was founded in 2012 and today is a $7 billion-plus leader in its field. It offers its subscription customers access to the proprietary Klaviyo Data Platform, complete with <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> insights, marketing automation, top-end analytics, and quality customer service.</p>\n<p>Klaviyo provides personalized service in an industry that tends toward automation. The company’s software systems are designed to bring that automation to bear where it is most needed – on the subscribers’ interactions with their own customers. Klaviyo makes it easy for its enterprise clients to know their customers, to foster profitable relationships, and to drive brand growth.</p>\n<p>In the background, supporting all of this, Klaviyo’s services include a wide range of high-quality, data-driven marketing tools, adapted to reap the advantages of AI technology. These include email and SMS marketing, automation for content generation, and a clean data library as a strong foundation.</p>\n<p>Despite all of these advantages, Klaviyo’s stock is down 41% so far this year. The shares have come under several sets of headwinds over the past several months, including ongoing worries that the stock may be overvalued. More recently, the company’s CEO, Andrew Bialecki, has been selling large blocks of shares over the past several weeks. One of his notable sales, on September 25, totaled more than $7.5 million worth of KVYO stock; during this month of October, he has sold two blocks worth a combined $8 million. And, during the summer, Klaviyo conducted a secondary stock offering that saw 6.5 million shares go on the market.</p>\n<p>When we turn to Klaviyo’s last earnings report, which covered 2Q25, we find that the company generated $293.1 million at the top line. This represented 32% year-over-year growth – and it was also $14.4 million better than had been expected. The company’s 16-cent non-GAAP EPS in the quarter beat the forecast by 3 cents per share.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo analyst Ryan MacWilliams sees Klaviyo’s strong use of AI as one key factor, among several, that bodes well for the company going forward. He writes of the stock, “KVYO’s data platform and Shopify integration provides a unique position to augment workflows with AI and agentic features for its customers. We anticipate that as KVYO scales its AI products and incorporates AI augmented features into its offerings, its growth algorithm will improve. We believe KVYO’s e-commerce market is ripe for AI utilization and its growing customers are more likely to buy vs. build… We view the shares of KVYO as undervalued given the tailwinds from the proliferation of agentic workflows in its core end-markets, the potential of its cross-sell opportunity, and the upmarket penetration opportunity.”</p>\n<p>The analyst goes on to rate KVYO as Overweight (Buy) with a $40 price target that suggests the stock has a 64% upside potential for the year ahead. (To watch MacWilliams’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/ryan-macwilliams\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>This stock has picked up 17 recent analyst reviews, all of them positive &nbsp;and naturally coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $24.33, and the average price target of $45.44 implies a one-year gain of 87%.

            "title": "Down More Than 40%: These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Are Flirting with a Bottom",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>In recognizing that lower price range, investors can turn to Wall Street’s pros for help. The analysts have been busy lately, picking out stocks that are in their lower price range, and are flirting with the bottom.</p>\n<p>We’ve used the&nbsp;<a href=\"/WJho/pna91n1n\">TipRanks database</a>&nbsp;to look up two such stocks, Strong Buys with plenty of upside potential – and each one is trading at or near its one-year low. Are these the low prices investors should consider? Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>LiveRamp Holdings</strong> <strong>(<a href=\"/stocks/ramp/forecast\">RAMP</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with LiveRamp, a San Francisco-based tech firm that offers its customers a data enablement platform, a product designed to make data accessible, easy to use – and secure. LiveRamp boasts more than 50 granted patents for its tech, and that its platform is used by more than 160 data providers. The system can connect data, devices, and people across the digital and physical worlds, making integration faster and more efficient without sacrificing digital security.</p>\n<p>Despite offering a solid product in an essential niche, LiveRamp has seen its share value drop sharply this year, losing 53% in that time frame. While the fall has been long-term and sustained, RAMP saw a particularly sharp drop of 20% in the last few days, since releasing its Q1 results for fiscal year 2023. A look at the results may help to explain what happened.</p>\n<p>First off, at $142.2 million, the top line grew 19% year-over-year. At the same time, earnings have been falling. In 1Q22, EPS was listed at 9 cents; the current report showed just 5 cents in per-share profit, a clear sign that margins are contracting. We should note, however, that the Q1 earnings beat the 1-cent forecast. Looking ahead, LiveRamp is guiding toward revenue gains of 13% in fiscal Q2 and the full fiscal year 2023, bringing expectations down from the current quarter’s performance.</p>\n<p>Despite the clear concern from investors, Morgan Stanley analyst <a href=\"/experts/analysts/elizabeth-porter\">Elizabeth Porter</a> notes that the company did beat the forecasts on both the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q1 report, and she goes on to point out that the company is showing solid execution on its sales plan.</p>\n<p>“Offsetting some of the slowdown is LiveRamp’s existing commitment to accelerating growth by investing in its sales force, expanding internationally, and accelerating their partner channel efforts. On the sales force front, management noted encouraging progress as the time to ramp for reps has shortened from 6 months to 4 months and reps are signing deals within their first quarter of joining,” Porter explained.</p>\n<p>“With the stock trading at a ~70% discount to the SaaS average, we see a favorable risk reward,” the analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>To this end, Porter rates RAMP an Overweight (i.e. Buy), describing the stock as ‘attractive,’ and sets a $36 price target that implies a 62% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Porter’s track record, <a href=\"/experts/analysts/elizabeth-porter\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>Even though this stock is down, Wall Street remains sanguine about its prospects. All 6 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $42.33 average price target suggests a strong 90% upside from the current trading price of $22.20.

CarGurus connects buyers and sellers, in both the new and used vehicle markets, and provides both sides with the information needed to create a smoother experience in both buying and selling cars. The platform uses data analytics, and allows buyers to search for vehicles based on price, mileage, options, accident history, pre-owned certification status, location, and dealer reputation. The data is transparent, and reflects more than 5 million auto listings.</p>\n<p>CarGurus operates mainly in the US, but also in Canada and the UK. The site boasts more than 36 million average monthly visitors and over 31,000 global paying dealers. At the beginning of last year, CarGurus made an important acquisition, buying a 51% interest in the CarOffer website. The move added wholesale vehicle purchase and selling to CarGurus dealer offerings.</p>\n<p>Since then, CarGurus has seen its revenues increase steadily. In the most recent quarter, CarGurus saw more than $511 million in top line revenues, for a powerful 135% year-over-year increase.</p>\n<p>While revenue growth is high, CarGurus’ earnings have been stalling. Non-GAAP income attributable to common shareholders was down y/y, from $46.9 million to $38 million. Per share, this meant that the year-ago quarter’s 39-cent EPS fell to 32 cents, a drop of almost 18%. On a positive note, CarGurus finished 2Q22 with $368.2 million in liquid assets and no debt on the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>So the financial results are basically sound – and yet the stock has fallen 43% year-to-date. The company’s forward guidance may be influencing that; investors were disappointed by the numbers projected for 3Q22. Management is guiding toward $460 million to $490 million in total revenue for Q3, along with EPS of 25 cents to 28 cents. These would represent significant drops from the Q2 results.</p>\n<p>Jefferies analyst <a href=\"/experts/analysts/john-colantuoni\">John&nbsp;Colantuoni</a> notes the drop in guidance here, but believes that there is a disconnect between what CarGurus can currently offer and what investors are pricing in, resulting in a stock that is undervalued. </p>\n<p>“Guidance for 3Q implies sizable downside to CarOffer estimates, driven by a reduction in purchases by rental car companies. While we expect the market to react negatively to the disappointing outlook, we believe the core Marketplace business continues to deliver remarkably durable results in a tough macro environment. Our SOTP also suggests that current valuation is pricing in little (or no) value for CarOffer, which creates an attractive risk-reward,” Colantuoni opined.</p>\n<p>At bottom, Colantuoni rates CARG a Buy, and his $32 price target implies a 12-month share gain of 67%. (To watch Colantuoni’s track record, <a href=\"/experts/analysts/john-colantuoni\"><strong>click here</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>Cars are big business, and this automotive e-commerce site has generated no fewer than 9 analyst reviews. The reviews include 7 to Buy against just 2 Holds, to back up the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in CARG are selling for $19.16 and have an average price target of $31.88, indicating a one-year upside potential of 66%.

            "title": "Microsoft Stock: Watch Out for These Catalysts, Says BofA",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>BofA analyst Brad Sills thinks sentiment is being weighed down by “<a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> infrastructure momentum away from Microsoft (to Oracle),” although he is not concerned about the company’s positioning.</p>\n<p>With the tech giant’s first fiscal quarter of 2026 results set to be released next Tuesday (October 28), Sills held some discussions with several partners to assess deal momentum ahead of the readout. Most indicated that deal activity remains “healthy,” and based on the feedback, Sills now anticipates a modest 0–1% upside to his Q1 revenue forecast of $77 billion (+18.2% year-over-year, +16.2% constant currency), supported by continued workload migration to Azure and solid performance in security and applications.</p>\n<p>The analyst now sees potential for Azure growth of 39% (+38% constant currency) compared to his base case of 38% (+37% constant currency). While strength in security was partially offset by softness in other workloads, this was mainly due to capacity constraints as customers deploy more compute-intensive workloads such as AI services, as well as enterprises taking additional time to map out multi-year strategies that further embed Microsoft’s solutions. Sills views both factors as positive for the longer term.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sills thinks Capex revisions are likely to act as a catalyst for the stock. The company continues to take a deliberate and strategic approach to expanding its AI infrastructure, keeping a balance between scaling capacity and ensuring energy independence. The analyst is encouraged by the increasing visibility around its compute investments, including Microsoft’s role in the Aligned Data Centers acquisition alongside BlackRock and Nvidia, as well as the “durable demand” for compute, highlighted by ongoing Azure capacity constraints. As a result, Sills now anticipates upward revisions to FY26 consensus Capex estimates of $115 billion (36% of revenues), which sits below his base case of $125 billion (38% of revenues).</p>\n<p>There are other potential catalysts, including the possibility of upward revisions to the current flat margin outlook as FY26 progresses, and faster commercial Office growth than the current 14%, supported by continued momentum in E3/E5 adoption and Copilot demand through the year. “We believe that Microsoft is well positioned to participate in the AI cycle in both the application and infrastructure markets,” Sills summed up.</p>\n<p>Sills still sees MSFT stock as a “top pick,” maintaining a Buy rating on the shares, backed by a $640 price objective. The implication for investors? Upside of 24% from current levels. (To watch Sills’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/bradley-sills\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Barring one skeptic, the Street wholeheartedly agrees with that stance; based on 33 Buys vs a lone Hold, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 22%, considering the average target clocks in at $630.41. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft/forecast\">See Microsoft stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Archer came out on top in a competitive bidding process for more than 300 patent assets covering a range of current and next-generation eVTOL technologies, paying roughly €18 million ($21 million).</p>\n<p>Lilium’s patents cover crucial innovations that could speed up Archer’s development of future Midnight eVTOL models, such as advanced high-voltage systems, battery tech and management, next-gen aircraft designs, electric engines, flight controls, propellers, and ducted fans.</p>\n<p>Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller thinks the company probably won the bid against Joby Aviation or Vertical Aerospace, believing it says something about the practicality of Lilium’s ideas. “We view this acquisition as a nod of approval from both Archer and the wider eVTOL industry that Lilium’s 50% silicon-dominant anode battery technology was likely more viable than its competitors previously made it out to be,” the analyst opined.</p>\n<p>In fact, the battery design’s performance – featuring 50% higher energy density and a fivefold increase in power – was validated by the DoE’s Idaho National Laboratory in 2023. “We imagine that it is also possible for Lilium’s landmark ducted fan technology to be used in a future blended wing architecture for regional air mobility (RAM) missions,” Moeller further said.</p>\n<p>The analyst thinks Archer will likely incorporate silicon-dominant anode lithium batteries in the next-generation Midnight, which could be adapted under a supplemental type certificate (STC) from the FAA to enhance the aircraft’s overall range and cargo (luggage/passenger) capacity. A longer range would also help alleviate concerns about reaching the 20-minute emergency battery reserve limit under visual flight rules (VFR) if air traffic control puts the aircraft in a holding pattern at an airport.</p>\n<p>Moeller advises investors to watch for mentions of future Midnight eVTOL battery technology on upcoming earnings calls, as well as any updates on the hybrid-VTOL drone variant being developed for the DoW in collaboration with Anduril. The analyst also thinks it’s worth noting that the US Army announced at AUSA last week plans to launch its own Collaborative Combat Aircraft competition, which could potentially feature rotorcraft drones, considering the Army’s large Apache attack helicopter fleet. “Both of these opportunities represent strong positive catalysts for the stock,” Moeller said.</p>\n<p>All told, Moeller maintained a Buy rating on the shares, along with a $13 price target, a figure that factors in 12-month returns of 12%. (To watch Moeller’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/austin-moeller\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Most analysts share Moeller’s enthusiasm. With an additional 5 Buys and 1 Hold, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy. The average target is only slightly higher than Moeller’s objective; at $13.14, shares are anticipated to appreciate by 13% over the coming months.

            "title": "Tesla Stock: Buy In Before Autonomous Valuation Gets Unlocked, Says Daniel Ives Ahead of Q3 Earnings",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Heading into the print, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, an analyst who ranks among the top 4% on Wall Street, notes “incremental positivity” regarding the readout, the upbeat sentiment down to a deliveries beat driven by some pull-forward EV demand ahead of the expiration of US EV tax credit and a modest recovery in China sales. “After a brutal few quarters we are finally starting to see stable demand trends for Tesla,” said the 5-star analyst. “With some Model Y refreshes abound we expect generally positive commentary around more stable demand into year-end.” That said, Ives also notes the expiration of the US EV tax credit and continued sluggish demand in Europe remain headwinds for now.</p>\n<p>For the quarter, consensus estimates call for total revenue of around $26 billion, including about $19 billion from automotive sales – a target Ives thinks is achievable given solid performance in both EV deliveries and energy generation. Gross margins (excluding credits) are expected to continue improving from past year’s lows, while beating the expected EPS of $0.53 is not out of the question, particularly if the higher-margin energy division delivers stronger results.</p>\n<p>While a headwind beforehand, China has now become a “source of strength,” with the Model Y fueling additional demand in the region. The new six-seat Model YL has also played a major role in attracting fresh buyers, even as more low-cost models enter the market. “Despite this <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> war playing out and changing daily, we believe that Tesla’s massive presence in China is a relatively good sign for Musk and Co. as Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory produces a significant amount of its global vehicles while rare earth minerals remain a crucial component for multiple products within the TSLA ecosystem (including Optimus),” Ives explained on the matter.</p>\n<p>As for what to look out for on the earnings call, the focus will turn to Tesla’s Robotaxi rollout across the US, the production ramp for Cybercabs and Optimus expected in 2026, and updates on any new models slated for early next year. While Wednesday’s earnings and guidance will be important, Ives thinks they are likely to “take a backseat” to Tesla’s larger <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> ambitions. “We continue to strongly believe the most important chapter in Tesla’s growth story is now beginning with the AI era now here,” Ives said. It begins with autonomy and then extends to robotics, with Ives believing the autonomous segment alone could be worth $1 trillion to Tesla’s valuation over the next few years – one that will start to get “unlocked over the coming months.”</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Ives maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $600 price target, implying the shares will post 12-month growth of 37%. (To watch Ives’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Ives’ positive stance gets the backing of 15 other analysts, yet with an additional 13 Holds and 10 Sells, the stock only claims a Hold consensus rating. Meanwhile, the $366.35 average target implies shares will lose 17% in the months ahead. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla/forecast\">See Tesla stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "title": "AMD Stock: The AI Bull Case Just Got Stronger, Says BofA",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>That is the opinion of BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who ranks among the top 3% of Street stock experts, following some positive announcements made at the event.</p>\n<p>Highlights for Arya include Oracle’s plan to introduce the first publicly available MI450 Series–based clusters featuring 50,000 GPUs starting in Q3. The Helios rack was also officially unveiled, built on Meta’s Open Rack Wide (ORW) standard as an open reference design. Arya points out that ORW support positions AMD in tandem with Meta’s data center architecture, potentially creating an opportunity for “further penetration” at Meta. AMD’s rack lineup will feature MI450 Series GPUs, Venice CPUs, and Vulcano DPUs, which Arya believes represents a $15–20 billion sales opportunity per gigawatt. Additionally, AMD now plays a role across all major open-standard AI networking ecosystems – UALink for scale-up links and switches, Ultra Ethernet for scale-out switches, and ESUN for L2/L3 scale-up fabrics and switches – supporting a “vendor-agnostic” ecosystem across CPUs, accelerators, NICs, and switches.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the ROCm software stack continues to show steady improvement, with the AMD ROCm PyTorch team actively working to lower the number of open ROCm-based disabled or skipped tests since June’s Advancing AI Day. And just as importantly, the Helios rack is now showcased as a fully operational system that can be viewed in person, rather than just a display featuring images of its components as was the case at the Advancing AI event.</p>\n<p>“Overall,” the 5-star analyst said, “we now see greater visibility into the deployment and ramp outlook of MI450 Series ‘Helios’ racks launching in 2H26, supported by key industry customers such as Oracle, Meta, and OpenAI.”</p>\n<p>Arya sees OpenAI’s first 1 GW deployment starting in 4Q26, representing approximately $17.5 billion in AMD GPU content per gigawatt, though the analyst conservatively assumes only 50% will materialize. This increases Arya’s CY26 and CY27 sales forecasts by $1.4 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, or +4% and +21%. If full deployment of six gigawatts occurs over four years, the analyst sees CY27 EPS of $10–11 and CY30 EPS of $15–16 or more. Importantly, says Arya, his base case assuming 50% OpenAI adoption implies a 4% and 5.4% share of the AI accelerator market in CY26 and CY27, respectively, as part of an estimated $287 billion and $430 billion market – significantly higher than his previous outlook of 3–4%. At full 100% deployment, Arya thinks AMD’s share could even approach 7.5%.</p>\n<p>With that opportunity now at play, Arya raised his price objective from $250 to $300, suggesting the stock will gain 29% in the months ahead. Arya’s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Arya’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/vivek-arya\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>28 other analysts also take a favorable view of AMD’s prospects, and with an additional 10 Holds, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 7%, considering the average target stands at $249.92. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast\">See AMD stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "title": "Wells Fargo Suggests 2 Energy Stocks to Buy in a Challenging Market",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Summing up this outlook, Wells Fargo analyst Sam Margolin writes, “We pick stocks based on return of capital trends, which have historically driven sector-wide share price performance. Since capital returns are in turn driven by commodity prices within cycles, this characterization might be considered an overly complex way of just saying energy stocks move with oil prices. But we find that to be a bit of a cop out, particularly ahead of potentially lower oil prices in the near to medium term. O&amp;G stocks can deliver attractive through-cycle total stock return via dividend CAGR, achieved by a combination of dividend burden management (buybacks), balance sheet care, disciplined reinvestment, diversification, and idiosyncratic factors like project timing, cost recovery built into Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), and regional considerations.”</p>\n<p>Margolin puts this stance into practice with some concrete stock recommendations, selecting two energy stocks to buy in what is shaping up to be a challenging market. Opening up the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a>, we’ve found that both of these Wells Fargo picks have ‘Buy’ ratings from the Street – but that Wells Fargo sees much better upside than the average. Here are the details.</p>\n<p><strong>ExxonMobil</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/xom/forecast\"><strong>XOM</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>The first Wells Fargo energy pick we’ll look at is ExxonMobil, one of the world’s largest oil companies – and the corporate descendant of John D. Rockefeller’s famous Standard Oil Company. ExxonMobil is a perennial part of the world’s top-five largest oil and gas companies; its current market cap of $478 billion ranks it second, and makes it the largest of the US-based oil firms. The company generated $349.6 billion in total revenue last year and paid out $16.7 billion in total dividends.</p>\n<p>ExxonMobil’s core business is the exploration, discovery, and exploitation of hydrocarbon energy resources, primarily crude oil and natural gas. This is backed up by extensive operations in the production and distribution of the refined products and fuels that are essential in today’s industrial world. These businesses have made ExxonMobil one of the world’s largest corporate producers of oil and gas, as well as a leader in such industries as petrochemicals, industrial chemicals, and plastics.</p>\n<p>In recent months, ExxonMobil has been expanding its production capabilities, in addition to boosting its refining capabilities. In September, the company expanded its output in its Guyana offshore projects, opening a seventh development that will have an output capacity of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. Earlier this month, the company signed a preliminary deal in Iraq for development of that country’s Majnoon oil field near the southern city of Basra. On the refining side, ExxonMobil in September opened new refining capacity in Singapore, using first-of-its-kind technology to enhance the production of high-value products such as lubricant base stocks. The new tech targets fuel oils and other “bottom-of-the-barrel” crude products for conversion to higher-value end products that will improve profitability.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to its Q3 results, expected on October 31, ExxonMobil is predicting high profits from both crude oil production and refining operations. The company’s crude oil profits will get an earnings boost of as much as $300 million from higher crude prices; the refined products are expected to generate between $300 million and $700 million in additional profits due to improved margins.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the company’s 2Q25 results, we see that ExxonMobil had $85.51 billion in total revenues. This was down 12% year-over-year, but it came in just over $1 billion better than had been expected. At the bottom line, the company’s EPS of $1.64 was 8 cents per share better than the forecast.</p>\n<p>For investors seeking an immediate return, ExxonMobil pays out a reliable dividend. The company has not missed a quarterly payment since 1995, although it will adjust the payment to keep it in accord with prevailing conditions. The last payment, declared on August 1 and paid out on September 10, was for 99 cents per share. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to $3.96 per share and gives a forward yield of 3.5%.</p>\n<p>Sam Margolin, in his write-up of ExxonMobil for Wells Fargo, takes a bullish stance, citing several factors. He says of the stock, “We are Overweight rated on XOM. Our rating reflects: 1) XOM’s industry-leading balance sheet profile and extensive Downstream footprint provide a defensive buffer in a softer oil price environment; 2) its capital/development program offers significant flexibility, supporting sufficient headroom for competitive dividend CAGR; 3) structural cost reductions, Permian production ramp, and long-cycle LNG growth enhance optionality, positioning XOM to outperform despite commodity headwinds.”</p>\n<p>That stated Overweight (Buy) rating comes along with a $156 price target that points toward a 39% gain for the shares on the one-year horizon.</p>\n<p>The Moderate Buy consensus rating on ExxonMobil is based on 18 analyst reviews, which break down to 11 Buys and 7 Holds. The stock is currently trading for $112.24 and has an average target price of $126.65; together, these suggest a 13% upside over the next 12 months.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Might now be the time to consider some defensive plays?</p>\n<p>That mindset will naturally lead us down the path to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dividends/best-dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> – the classic defensive move. These names tend to be more stable and less volatile than riskier asset classes. Moreover, top-quality <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> boast consistent payouts and attractive yields, offering investors a source of steady income.</p>\n<p>Piper Sandler analyst Crispin Love has been eyeing the segment and has spotted an opportunity in two dividend stocks that just might fit the bill.</p>\n<p>Even better, running both tickers through the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks database</a>, we find both are viewed positively by Wall Street analysts. Let’s dig in.</p>\n<p><strong>Annaly Capital (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nly/forecast\"><strong>NLY</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>Those seeking dividend stocks with high yields will often turn to REITs (real estate investment trusts), which are known for their steady income streams and requirement to distribute most of their earnings to shareholders. This is the segment Annaly Capital operates in.</p>\n<p>Annaly is a leading mortgage REIT and diversified capital manager based in New York. It mostly invests in mortgage-related assets – including agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency residential loans, commercial mortgage securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other real estate credit instruments.</p>\n<p>Although NLY operates across several segments, its agency MBS portfolio is the main breadwinner. As of the end of Q2, the company held a total portfolio valued at $89.5 billion, with $79.5 billion invested in its highly liquid Agency MBS strategy. This segment accounts for 89% of total assets and 62% of the firm’s allocated capital. Residential Credit accounted for $6.6 billion, while Mortgage Servicing Rights made up $3.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the quarter, the company generated an adj. EPS of $0.73, beating the Street’s forecast by $0.02, and enough to cover its $0.70 dividend. The last payment was declared on September 10 and will be paid out on October 31. NLY’s dividend offers a 13.6% yield, far above the sector average of 3.3%.</p>\n<p>The robust dividend forms part of Crispin Love’s investment thesis here. The Piper Sandler analyst writes: “The environment has changed dramatically in recent months given the start of the Fed rate cutting cycle as well as significant agency spread tightening and GSE reform commentary. We expect the forward return outlook as well as the potential for GSE reform to be popular topics on the earnings call. We remain Overweight on Annaly given its diversified model that can perform in numerous environments, its solid dividend, and attractive valuation.”</p>\n<p>That Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating is backed by a $22.50 price target, suggesting the stock will gain ~8% over the coming months. Add in the dividend, and investors could be pocketing returns of more than 20%. (To watch Love’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/crispin-love\">click here</a>) </p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NLY stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 5 Buys vs. 2 Holds. At $21.57, the average target factors in a one-year gain of ~4%. (See <strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nly/forecast\">NLY stock forecast</a></strong>)</p>\n<p></p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>But there’s another view circulating, too, taking the position that the current AI boom is the real deal. Covering tech stocks for Wedbush, 5-star analyst Daniel Ives describes Big Tech and AI as leaders of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution,’ a truly game-changing evolution of the digital/technological/industrial landscape.</p>\n<p>“We believe tech stocks will be very strong into year-end&nbsp;and could be up another 10%+ into the rest of the year as the next part of this AI Revolution takes hold with upcoming tech earnings season further swaying investors this is a 1996 Moment…and not a 1999 Momen,” Ives opined. “In a nutshell, there are concerns among investors in the region around the on again/off again US/China tensions and this remains an ongoing soap opera as we saw manifest last week. There clearly could be hiccups ahead on the trade war tensions, but we instead focus on the sheer demand, AI use cases, supply chain feedback to further confirm our bullish view of the AI Revolution,”.</p>\n<p>Taking his upbeat view of AI and tech to its logical next step, Ives goes on to choose three tech stock giants – including Elon Musk’s Tesla – as shares to buy in the coming months. Let’s give them a closer look to find out why Ives is bullish, and with some help from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks database</a>, we can see if the general Street view aligns with Ives’ take.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\"><strong>AAPL</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with Apple, a tech titan whose ecosystem remains one of the most powerful in the industry. The company’s success has long rested on its ability to combine hardware, software, and services into a seamless experience that keeps users firmly within its ecosystem.</p>\n<p>That strategy has paid off. Apple now counts over 2.35 billion active devices globally, including more than 1.5 billion iPhones. This vast installed base forms a dependable foundation for recurring revenue through services such as iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store. With a market capitalization of around $3.7 trillion, Apple stands among the world’s most valuable companies.</p>\n<p>Apple has fallen a bit behind in the AI stakes, but is working to integrate AI technology into its devices and services. The company’s AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, is bringing updates and improvements to a wide range of Apple’s features across the full array of Apple’s devices. Apple Intelligence is already built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.</p>\n<p>Looking at Apple’s last earnings report, from the company’s fiscal 3Q25, we see that the revenue total of $94 billion was a record for the company’s June quarter. The quarterly revenue beat the forecast by $4.87 billion and was up 10% year-over-year. At its bottom line, Apple reported earnings of $1.57 per share, beating the forecast by 14 cents per share and increasing 12% year-over-year.</p>\n<p>In his coverage of Apple, Daniel Ives focuses on the still-unearthed AI potential, while noting that the large device and user base forms a solid foundation.</p>\n<p>“The elephant in the room has been the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts through outside partnerships… We believe the AI monetization piece could add $75 to $100 per share to the Apple story over the coming few years as it finally plays out after a very disappointing WWDC this past June. We believe no ‘AI premium’&nbsp;is factored into Apple’s stock at current prices which makes this a compelling large cap tech name to own into year-end and 2026,” Ives opined.</p>\n<p>Quantifying his stance, Ives gives AAPL an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, along with a $310 price target that points toward a gain of 25% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Ives’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/daniel-ives\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Apple’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 36 recent reviews that include 20 to Buy, 13 to Hold, and 3 to Sell. The stock is priced at $247.45, and its $255.84 average target price implies a modest upside of 3% for the year ahead.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Micron is riding a wave of AI-driven demand for its products, the rally boosted by record earnings, a recent estimate-crushing guide, and plenty of support on the Street, making the company one of the winners of the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> boom. And it looks like demand is not about to slow down anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Citi analyst Christopher Danely believes that the next major development in the AI supply chain will be excellent news for one of Micron’s core offerings. “We believe DRAM will be the next type of chip to secure long-term contracts with the AI food chain given its importance and projected undersupply, similar to what happened with NVDA, AMD and AVGO,” Danely said.</p>\n<p>And that should help extend the current DRAM upcycle. Danely believes this trend is being driven by AI companies seeking to lock in DRAM supply amid surging demand across the AI sector, and Micron is set to benefit via “higher and sustainable DRAM pricing.”</p>\n<p>That, in turn, will help push gross margins back to previous peaks and help EPS peak above $23.00. Accordingly, Danely has made some changes to his MU model.</p>\n<p>The analyst expects gross margins to rise from 44.7% in F4Q25 to 60.0% in F3Q26E, approaching the previous peak of 60.8% during the 2018 DRAM upturn. &nbsp;Recall, in the current cycle, Micron’s gross margins hit a low of -14.4% in 2023.</p>\n<p>Danely also forecasts peak EPS will reach $23.02 in calendar year 2026, nearly double the prior peak of $12.26 in 2018. Reflecting this outlook, the analyst has raised his estimates: F2026 sales and EPS are now expected to land at $62.5 billion and $21.05, up from $56.0 billion and $16.93; driven by the prospect of long-term contracts, F2027 sales and EPS are bumped to $65.0 billion and $20.31, up from $52.5 billion and $15.93; lastly, F2028 sales and EPS are lifted to $65.0 billion and $19.71, up from $52.5 billion and $15.93.</p>\n<p>All of that merits a new price target; Danely’s objective goes from $200 to $240, suggesting the stock will gain 19% over the one-year timeframe. Danely’s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Danely’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/christopher-danely\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the Street, the stock claims an additional 26 Buys and 3 Holds, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Considering the big gains, the $209.32 average target factors in modest 12-month returns of 4%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mu/forecast\">See Micron stock forecast</a>)</p>",

            "title": "Alphabet Stock: These Are the Key Issues to Watch Ahead of Q3 Readout, Says Roth",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Investors have evidently warmed to the notion the tech giant will remain a key player in the new AI-led paradigm, given the stock has gained 64% over the past 6 months.</p>\n<p>Now, with the company slated to release Q3 results on October 29, Roth’s Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst ranked among the top 3% of Street stock experts, has been looking into the big issues investors are focused on.</p>\n<p>Of course, the direction of the Search business is top of the list and while the company’s AI positioning is currently seen in a more favorable light, Kulkarni thinks Search is now “entering a period of incremental volatility.” Over the past 90 days, OpenAI has been “unusually active,” releasing a steady stream of product and partnership announcements, likely preparing for an ads rollout in 2026. If Amazon’s decision to pause Google ads for a thirty-day period (as it did in July) is any indication of what comes next, Search has a “bumpy road ahead.” While Google’s AI Overviews earn similar revenue to traditional search, they generate fewer searches and clicks, relying on higher CPCs. And right now, AI Mode remains experimental, although GOOGL has added tools like an agentic toolkit to encourage more efficient queries and usage beyond standard search and business listings.</p>\n<p>The Search business might be facing a challenging period, but Kulkarni sees plenty to be buoyed about in Google Cloud. GOOGL and META signed a six-year cloud contract worth over $10 billion in August, as AI compute needs and demand for capacity continue to outpace advances in leading AI lab models. GCP’s growth in Q2 was fueled by larger deal sizes and a rising trajectory in enterprise AI workloads. “We think building on top of Gemini provides these enterprises further incentive to choose GCP in both experimental and scaled AI-based cloud spend, and optionality in GPU and TPU infrastructure may allow for improved compute efficiency both in training and inference,” Kulkarni said on the matter.</p>\n<p>Kulkarni also thinks upward revisions to CapEx are coming. As he noted in a late-August analysis of the AI CapEx race, the analyst finds it surprising consensus expects CapEx intensity and Mega Cap reinvestment capacity to peak in 2026. GOOGL already raised its 2025 CapEx guidance from $74 billion to $85 billion in Q2, and Kulkarni expects that “story to continue” as LLM usage expands, AI cloud demand hasn’t displayed any signs of slowing down, and visibility into 2026–2027 supply continues to improve.</p>\n<p>So, what does all of this ultimately mean for investors? Kulkarni maintained a Buy rating on the shares, backed by a $265 price target. This suggests the stock will climb a modest 4% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Kulkarni’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/rohit-kulkarni\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Of the 37 analysts to have reviewed GOOGL’s prospects during the past 3 months, 29 implore to Buy, while 8 say Hold, all culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, the $258.6 average target implies shares will stay rangebound for the time being. It will be interesting to see whether analysts boost their price targets or downgrade their ratings shortly.

            "title": "AMD Stock: GPU Revenue Certainty Merits New Price Target, Says Wedbush",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Earlier this week, AMD and Oracle revealed a deal under which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will start an initial rollout of 50,000 AMD MI450 chips in 3Q26, with plans to expand the deployment further from 2027 onward. This announcement came shortly after AMD and OpenAI unveiled a partnership aimed at deploying six gigawatts of AI capacity powered by AMD technology.</p>\n<p>These developments have not gone unnoticed by Wedbush’s Matt Bryson, an analyst ranked among the top 1% on Wall Street. When Bryson last previewed AMD’s earnings, he noted that for his projections to push higher, he would need significantly more positive updates on AMD’s 350 and 400 series GPUs – progress that would enable the analyst to “substantially bolster” his datacenter GPU estimates.</p>\n<p>Well, the Lisa Su-led company has taken on that challenge with aplomb. “Over the last quarter, AMD has clearly provided future certainty around GPU demand announcing new agreements that promise to substantially lift future GPU revenues,” the 5-star analyst said.</p>\n<p>Even accounting for potential overlap between the two announcements – since much of OCI’s future capacity seems intended to meet OpenAI’s needs – Bryson estimates that each gigawatt of capacity could translate to roughly $20 billion in AMD product demand. This suggests the OpenAI partnership alone could “dwarf” Bryson’s previous forecasts, which anticipated total revenues of about $20 billion across 2026 and 2027 combined.</p>\n<p>As a result, the analyst has made upward revisions to forward estimates. For Q3 and Q4, Bryson has raised his forecasts slightly to reflect stronger-than-expected demand in both PC and server compute, which he believes primarily benefits AMD. His datacenter GPU projections for this period remain largely unchanged.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to next year, Bryson has increased his datacenter GPU and AI estimates for the second half, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. Bryson now sees 2026 EPS of $5.81, revenue of $40.3 billion, and gross margins of 55.5%, vs. previous projections of $5.62 in EPS, $38.8 billion in revenue and 55.5% gross margins. Still, even with this upward adjustment, Bryson’s forecast for total AI datacenter revenue in 2026 remains around $10 billion, as he expects AMD’s revenue ramp to take a bit longer.</p>\n<p>By 2027, however, Bryson anticipates AMD will be supplying a significant share of a gigawatt of capacity to OpenAI, driving AI-related revenue to about $20 billion. Consequently, even after factoring in higher operating expenses in line with revenue growth, he now sees EPS rising sharply to $9 in 2027, up from $5.81 in 2026.</p>\n<p>All of that merits a new price target, which goes from $190 to $270, suggesting the stock will gain 13% over the coming months. Bryson’s rating stays an Outperform (i.e., Buy). (To watch Bryson’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/matt-bryson\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>29 other analysts also back AMD’s case, while 10 Holds can’t detract from a Strong Buy consensus rating. However, the big recent gains (up 170% over the past 6 months) now leave room for just modest one-year upside of 4%.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Rocket Lab’s Electron small-lift launch vehicle – which carries a list price of about $8.5 million per mission – has completed 72 launches since its 2017 debut, achieving a roughly 94% success rate. This makes it the second most successful commercial space launch vehicle globally over the past decade by launch volume, behind SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which has completed 565 launches since 2015.</p>\n<p>Since 2021, the company has been developing its larger Neutron rocket, priced around $50 million per launch, aimed at the medium-lift market currently led by the Falcon 9. The Neutron’s first flight is expected in the second half of 2025 or early next year.</p>\n<p>Baird’s Peter Arment, an analyst ranked among the top 1% of Street stock experts, points out that the global space launch market is expected to grow at a mid-teens or higher annual rate through the next decade. From 2020 to 2024, global launches have increased by roughly 22% per year, with year-to-date 2025 launches up about 19% year-over-year. Arment anticipates that global launch activity will continue to expand at least at a mid-teens CAGR (compound annual growth rate) between 2025 and 2030, supported by “significant demand signals from space customers.”</p>\n<p>And Rocket Lab is very well-positioned to make the most of that opportunity. Its reputation as a dependable launch provider is well established, backed by its 94% mission success rate and Street expectations for revenue growth of more than 34% annually through 2030. That growth is expected to accelerate once the larger Neutron rocket begins operations in the “highly lucrative” medium-lift segment, positioning it as a “direct competitor” to SpaceX’s Falcon 9.</p>\n<p>Arment also sees “significant margin expansion potential” through 2030, expecting gross margins to rise from 32.3% in 2025 to 47.5%, led by Launch Services reaching 50% margins by 2030 (up from 29.2%), driven by higher Electron launch cadence and Neutron first-stage reusability, which allows costs to be spread across multiple launches. Meanwhile, Space Systems margins should reach 45% (up from 33.5%) as vertical integration reduces costs and multi-satellite contracts expand across commercial and government programs, including earth observation, missile tracking, and internet connectivity.</p>\n<p>Also standing in its stead is a “clean balance sheet” in net cash position. Combined with access to its ATM facility, this provides financial flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions that could further strengthen its vertically integrated spacecraft manufacturing operations within the Space Systems segment.</p>\n<p>“We see RKLB becoming a $200+ stock longer-term, assuming solid launch cadence growth is combined with reusable rocket technology development,” Arment summed up.</p>\n<p>For now, however, the analyst initiated coverage of RKLB with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating and a more modest $83 price target. Nevertheless, that target is a Street-high and offers one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Arment’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/peter-arment\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>8 other analysts join Arment in the bull camp, and with an additional 5 Holds, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. However, the $56.42 average target implies shares have overshot by 18.5%. With this in mind, keep an eye out for either price target hikes or rating downgrades shortly.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Even so, the main stock indexes remain near record highs. Tech stocks, led by the so-called ‘Magnificent 7,’ have continued to power market gains, fueled by enthusiasm around AI. Over the past year, the tech-heavy NASDAQ has advanced by 23.5%.</p>\n<p>The strength of this rally and the market’s <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> fixation have raised concerns about a potential bubble. However, Goldman Sachs’ chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer argues that we’re not there yet. While acknowledging the risks, he believes investors still have room to benefit from current trends before valuations reach truly excessive levels.</p>\n<p>“Bubbles tend to develop when there is a combined surge in stock prices and valuations to an extent that the aggregate value of companies associated with the innovation exceed the future potential cash flows that it is likely to generate. Valuations of the technology sector are becoming stretched but not yet at levels consistent with historical bubbles. While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and increased competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” Oppenheimer noted.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts are drawing attention to two lesser-known stocks with sound upside potential of at least 40% in the months ahead. While the broader markets hover near record highs, these picks are actually trading at depressed levels, but the Goldman analysts think that is about to change. Here’s a closer look at them, using data drawn from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>StubHub Holdings</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/stub/forecast\"><strong>STUB</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>Ticketed venues – concerts, plays, sports events, festivals, and the like – are increasingly popular entertainment attractions. StubHub, which was founded in 2000, offers users a comprehensive platform to access live event tickets. Eventgoers can use the online system or the mobile app to peruse events of all kinds and to order tickets in advance. StubHub operates under two brand names – its eponymous activities are in the North American market, while internationally the company goes by the name of Viagogo.</p>\n<p>Using StubHub’s service is easy. The system starts by showing ticketed events near the user’s location; search options allow for expanded searches or searches narrowed to specific events or dates. Users will need an account and login to purchase tickets. For now, StubHub operates as a secondary ticket issuer but is working to become a direct ticket issuer. In early September, as an example, the company announced a multi-year agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB) for direct issuance. The partnership is set to begin for the 2026 baseball season and makes StubHub’s direct issuance technology available to MLB.</p>\n<p>Also in September of this year, StubHub went public through an IPO. The company had tried several times over the past few years to hold an IPO; public launches in 2024 and earlier in 2025 were canceled due to ‘choppy’ market conditions or increased volatility. In the offering last month, however, StubHub successfully put 34,042,553 shares on the market at a price of $23.50 each, raising gross proceeds of approximately $800 million. We should note that STUB shares have fallen since the IPO and are now trading 18% below the IPO price.</p>\n<p>However, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan likes what he sees in StubHub, particularly the company’s potential to enter the direct issuer market.</p>\n<p>“We view StubHub to be positively levered to the large and growing ticketing market – which will continue to scale as consumers continue to prioritize experiences over products (a multi-decade secular trend),” the analyst said. “Today, StubHub is a share leader in the global secondary ticketing market and we expect the company will be able to take additional share (both in North America and Internationally), while also scaling into the $132bn original issuance market opportunity (through direct issuance business) and growing its advertising revenues in the years ahead.”</p>\n<p>Sheridan goes on to give STUB a Buy rating, along with a price target of $46 that suggests a robust one-year upside of 139%. (To watch Sheridan’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/eric-sheridan\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, STUB’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 11 reviews, including 10 Buys and just 1 Hold. The stock’s $27.80 average price target suggests a 44% upside from the $19.25 trading price.

            "title": "2 ‘Perfect 10’ Stocks Wall Street’s Biggest Banks Are Betting On",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Making sense of that ocean of information takes time and expertise, which is why professional analysts dedicate their careers to it, often narrowing their focus to specific industries or market segments. For everyone else, diving that deep into the numbers is rarely practical.</p>\n<p>That’s where <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and TipRanks’ <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a> step in. The <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks\">Smart Score</a> is an algorithm that applies <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a> and natural language processing to evaluate every publicly traded stock. It analyzes a wide range of factors statistically linked to future outperformance and distills them into a simple 1-to-10 score.</p>\n<p>Stocks that achieve a ‘Perfect 10’ stand out as particularly compelling – and when top Wall Street banks share that conviction, it’s a combination worth noticing.</p>\n<p>We turned to the TipRanks database to find such names and identified two ‘Perfect 10’ stocks that also enjoy strong endorsements from major banks. Here’s a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>QXO Inc. (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qxo/forecast\"><strong>QXO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>Up first on our list of ‘Perfect 10’ stocks is QXO, a distribution company working in the building materials sector. QXO offers lines of roofing, siding, waterproofing, and other related building and construction products in the North American market. The company has over 600 locations, and a fleet of over 3,000 trucks to facilitate product deliveries.</p>\n<p>Getting into specifics, QXO’s products are divided into three segments: exterior materials, interior materials, and tools &amp; supplies. On the first, the company offers such items as decks &amp; railings, lumber &amp; composites, windows, sidings, accessory fittings – to name just a few. Interior materials include such vitals as drywall and insulation, while tools and equipment include everything from nails and fasteners to hand tools and air-powered tools to personal safety gear such as hard hats.</p>\n<p>However, QXO&nbsp;only recently became a building products distributor. In 2Q25, QXO finalized its acquisition of Beacon Roofing Supply, significantly expanding its presence in the building products distribution market, including roofing and related construction materials. Before the deal that transformed the company, QXO was a much smaller software and technology firm focused on digital platforms and tech-driven solutions.</p>\n<p>The acquisition led to huge growth in the firm’s last set of financial results, with net sales rising from just $14.5 million in 2Q24 to $1.91 billion in 2Q25, and beating the forecast by $32.7 million. At the bottom line, the company’s 11-cent non-GAAP EPS was 7 cents better than the forecast.</p>\n<p>This stock has caught the attention of Morgan Stanley, one of the banking industry’s biggest names. MS analyst Christopher Snyder is impressed by the company’s growth and the opportunity offered in the building sector by lower interest rates, writing, “QXO is expected to compound EBITDA at a ~40% CAGR through decade — roughly 5x the peer group, yet shares trade at a discount… While the QXO value creation opportunity is not cycle dependent, it always helpful. After US construction stagnated in 2023-25 on higher rates, we are beginning to see signs of cycle momentum and potential NTM rate cuts would further aid the recovery into 2026. QXO also screens to benefit from <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> policy by shifting more investment into the US (ie structures that need roof) while Tariffs also bring higher industry price which would translate to higher profits for QXO as the company looks to expand its GM into 2026 and the higher price environment.”</p>\n<p>These comments are accompanied by an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating, as well as a $35 price target that suggests a robust one-year gain for the stock of 89%. (To watch Snyder’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/christopher-snyder\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>QXO’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 12 recent analyst reviews that feature a lopsided split of 11-to-1 in favor of Buy over Hold. The shares are trading for $18.50, and their $30.65 average target price implies an upside of 66% in the year ahead.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>It started with China, which announced plans to impose export controls on rare earth elements and certain products containing them – a critical category of materials used in everything from smartphones and EVs to military systems. China currently dominates roughly 70% of the global supply of rare earths, giving it significant leverage in this space.</p>\n<p>In response, President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> initially announced sweeping new tariffs – in some cases up to 100% – on Chinese imports, raising fears of an all-out trade conflict and sending markets tumbling on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 2.71%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.56%.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, however, Trump appeared to soften his tone, saying: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!” The comment helped calm investors, with U.S. stocks moving higher ahead of the week’s trading.</p>\n<p>Even though volatility has returned, that doesn’t mean investors should stay on the sidelines. Pullbacks like this can sometimes open the door to attractive entry points in quality names. Bank of America’s analysts share that view, highlighting two stocks they believe offer solid opportunities. We’ve opened up the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to take a closer look at their picks.</p>\n<p><strong>Darling Ingredients</strong><strong> (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dar/forecast\"><strong>DAR</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first company we’ll look at here is Darling Ingredients, a firm with its hands in several areas: recycling, food tech, and agribusiness. Darling has built its business by collecting waste materials from the animal husbandry, agriculture, and food industries and using those materials as the base to create new, useful products in feed, food, and fuels. Darling’s end products include animal feeds, human food products and additives, and renewable biofuels.</p>\n<p>The company’s work is split among those three main segments. On the feed side, Darling produces a range of essential ingredients, including fats and proteins, that are used in animal nutrition, for both livestock and pets. The company’s feedstock fats are also an essential base ingredient for the biofuel industry. Darling is the largest rendering company in the global feed market.</p>\n<p>Turning to human food, Darling has a reputation as a global leader in gelatin and collagen solutions. The company has 16 factories around the world and sells its products in more than 80 countries. The company’s gelatin products are used as stabilizers, clarifiers, and thickeners in a wide variety of food products, while the collagen products are used in the health and wellness sector. Darling is also known for producing natural protein ingredients for the meat industry and has its hands in the biopharmaceutical field, where it provides medical-grade gelatins. We should note here that Darling and Tessenderlo Group have entered into a joint venture, dubbed Nextida, that will combine the two companies’ collagen and gelatin segments. The venture will be 85% owned by Darling and is projected to generate $1.5 billion in revenue.</p>\n<p>Finally, Darling’s fuel segment produces renewable biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuels, and biogas. The biodiesel is derived mainly from cooking oil and animal fats, and the company produces approximately 1.2 billion gallons per year. Darling’s aviation fuel is also produced from waste fats and oils, while the biogas is generated from food waste and pig manure.</p>\n<p>Turning to Darling’s last financial report, which covered 2Q25, we find that Darling generated $1.5 billion in net sales for the quarter, representing a 1.4% year-over-year increase—but also just missing the forecast, coming up $804,000 short. At the bottom line, Darling’s 8-cent EPS represented a year-over-year decline of 41 cents and was 23 cents per share less than had been expected.</p>\n<p>Despite the miss on the Q2 results, Bank of America’s Conor Fitzpatrick sees plenty of potential in Darling Ingredients. The shares are down approximately 10% this year, but Fitzpatrick writes of Darling, “We see a robust recovery in RD margin based on 2026 RINs demand growth. RD margins have been the main driver of total EBITDA revisions and stock performance over the last several years, so we rate Buy expecting RD margins to recover and for share prices to also rise. Long-term value is additionally supported by Feed volume growth due to policy-related demand targets. Assuming the Food Nextida gelatin &amp; collagen JV is finalized, accretive monetization of that JV could be an additional catalyst.”</p>\n<p>That Buy rating is accompanied by a $45 price objective that suggests a one-year upside potential of 49.5%. (To watch Fitzpatrick’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/conor-fitzpatrick\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Darling’s stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the Street, based on 10 reviews that include 8 to Buy and 2 to Sell. The stock is priced at $30.10, and its $45.80 average target price implies a gain of 52% in the next 12 months.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>For investors, however, the broad industry momentum hasn’t translated into a reliable signal for restaurant stocks. Performance across the sector remains uneven, with some posting notable gains while others continue to lag. This divergence underscores how much individual business dynamics – and at times, sheer timing – can influence stock performance.</p>\n<p>Given that, the current state of the restaurant sector suggests that there are going to be plenty of hidden gems there – stocks with beaten-down share prices and sound prospects for growth.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, RBC analyst Logan Reich is looking at two such names that are down more than 30% and says it’s time for investors to pull the trigger.</p>\n<p>According to data from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks platform</a>, both of these RBC picks carry ‘Buy’ ratings and double-digit upside potential for the year ahead. Let’s take a closer look to see what RBC finds appealing about these names, and why they might be compelling choices for investors hunting for bargain-priced restaurant stocks.</p>\n<p><strong>CAVA Group</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cava/forecast\"><strong>CAVA</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>CAVA Group, the first RBC pick we’ll look at here, is a fast-casual chain based in Washington, DC, that offers diners a menu of Mediterranean fare. The company competes in both the limited-service restaurant sector and the health and wellness eatery niche, and boasts that its food has a broad appeal that is fueling sound growth.</p>\n<p>That growth can be measured in the company’s expansion. In 2018, Cava purchased the competing Zoe’s Kitchen restaurant chain, and by 2023 had converted all Zoe’s locations to Cava restaurants. As of July 13 this year, the end of Cava’s fiscal 2Q25, the company had 398 restaurants in operation, a total that represented a year-over-year increase of nearly 17%. Since the second quarter ended, Cava has announced new restaurant openings in Canton, Michigan, as well as in Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Miami. The Canton location was the first in that state; the other three locations were the first in those cities.</p>\n<p>Also in the fiscal Q2 report, Cava reported revenue of $280.6 million, and an EPS of 16 cents. The company’s topline total was up 20% year-over-year yet missed the forecast by $4.8 million; the EPS figure was down 1 cent year-over-year, but was 2 cents per share better than had been anticipated. Of more concern to investors, Cava reported a sharp slowdown in its year-over-year same-store sales growth. This figure came in at just 2.1% for fiscal Q2, compared to the 14.4% figure in fiscal 2Q24. Growth for the company’s same-store sales has been sliding for months – the metric was reported as 21.2% in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024, and was 10.8% in fiscal 1Q25.</p>\n<p>The slowdown has been worrying investors all year, and the miss in revenue for 2Q25 underlined those worries. We should note here that shares in CAVA are down approximately 42% for the year-to-date.</p>\n<p>RBC analyst Logan Reich covers this restaurant stock, and he believes that the slowing growth will likely turn out to be a blip rather than a prolonged trend. Noting that Cava inhabits a popular niche and holds a strong position within it, Reich says of the stock, “We view CAVA as the dominant brand in the fast-growing Mediterranean category with a long runway for unit growth. And with shares down 45% YTD we think this presents an opportunity given improving unit economics, which we think prompted Q2’s unit growth guide up, despite SSS deceleration. While NT SSS growth may continue to be volatile given ongoing consumer spending dynamics where the broader fast casual space experienced challenging traffic trends in Q2, we think that’s well-appreciated by investors. Over the next few years we think CAVA can comp in the MSDs driven by outsized category growth relative to restaurants more broadly, operational improvements, marketing, and menu innovation…”</p>\n<p>The analyst quantifies his stance with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on these shares, and he complements that with an $80 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 23%. (To watch Reich’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/logan-reich\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, CAVA stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the Street, based on 18 recent analyst reviews that include 12 Buys and 6 Holds. The shares are priced at $63.16, and their $91.24 average target price implies a gain of 44% in the year ahead.

            "title": "Barclays Says These 2 Industrial Tech Stocks Are Top Agentic AI Plays",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>That next leap forward appears to be agentic AI. This emerging paradigm marks a shift from rules-based operations and decision-making to systems capable of autonomous activity, and the implications are staggering. Earlier digital technology gave us cloud computing and IoT; AI, as noted, brought task automation into the mix; and now agentic AI promises to introduce independent software agents that can learn continuously, interact with their environment and with each other, and coordinate workflows – all without human supervision.</p>\n<p>The implications are tremendous, and writing for Barclays, analyst Guy Hardwick lays out just where this can take us.</p>\n<p>“We believe that agentic AI can be transformative for industrial companies and industrial tech is among the best routes to investing in the rise of agentic AI, just as Industry 4.0 was an investment opportunity in digitization. Companies providing components to datacenters are already reaping the rewards of this transformation, in our view, and we expect the beneficiaries to broaden from advanced GenAI investment, including AI agents that improve processes and productivity, which we believe should be positive for industrial margins,” Hardwick noted.</p>\n<p>Hardwick follows from this premise to recommend two industrial tech stocks as top plays in the emerging world of agentic AI. We’ve opened up the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\">TipRanks database</a> to see how his picks stack up on Wall Street. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p><strong>Manhattan Associates</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/manh/forecast\"><strong>MANH</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first Barclay pick on our list, Manhattan Associates, is a global leader in industrial technology. Specifically, the company works in the fields of supply chain and omnichannel commerce, offering enterprise customers a software platform and related technology designed to merge the needs of front-end sales and back-end supply chain execution. These are vital areas for any business, and by putting them in harness together, Manhattan Associates helps its customers to boost both total revenues and bottom-line profits.</p>\n<p>Manhattan Associates’ platform lets users manage every aspect of their supply and omnichannel marketing, unifying the experience for customers and connecting every aspect of the back-office operation. The company has long made use of AI tech to automate these processes, and today is moving to integrate agentic AI into the mix.</p>\n<p>The company’s Agent Foundry, established in the second half of this year, gives subscription users access to a wide range of commercial and reference AI agents, and also allows Manhattan Active customers to quickly and easily build new agents to meet their own unique needs. Developers can use existing agents as a template, or create new agents from the ground up; either way, the addition of agentic AI brings greater autonomy to supply chain operations.</p>\n<p>Adding agentic AI to the platform brings a suite of advantages to the company’s customers, and Manhattan Associates lays them out clearly. These include a better user experience for subscription customers, faster time to market for customers’ products, consequent improvements in human productivity, and more accurate real-time data analysis to tie it all together.</p>\n<p>Before looking at Manhattan Associates’ last quarterly report, covering 2Q25, we should note that the stock dropped sharply earlier this year, in the wake of the 4Q24 report. While that report beat top and bottom line expectations, the company also reduced revenue and earnings guidance for the full fiscal year 2025. The stock is down 23% for the year-to-date – even after seeing a boost from the 2Q25 results.</p>\n<p>That most recent financial report showed a top line of $272.4 million, beating the forecast by $8.68 million and growing 2.7% year-over-year. At the bottom line, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.31 per share, 18 cents per share better than had been forecast and an increase from the $1.18 reported in the prior-year period.</p>\n<p>Analyst Hardwick, writing for Barclays, explains how this firm’s work with agentic AI is likely to bring continued gains, as it builds on the company’s existing lead in its niche. He writes, “MANH is the leader in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) software. Due to its superior product suite as well as its cloud-native platform, and with agentic AI enhancements ramping in 4Q, we believe MANH will maintain its market leadership in the WMS market. The company is successfully cross-selling into its WMS customer base, gaining share in other products including transportation management systems (TMS) and supply chain planning. MANH is approaching a major renewal cycle in 2026, which poses a significant opportunity for cross-selling. Furthermore, MANH is already seeing the productivity benefits of agentic AI internally, which is enabling it to improve its leverage over R&amp;D spending.”</p>\n<p>Hardwick puts an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the stock, and his $247 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 18%. (To watch Hardwick’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/guy-hardwick\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, MANH shares have earned a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent reviews that include 7 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is priced at $208.9 and its $233.25 average target price points toward a gain of 12% over the next year.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>It evolved into agentic AI, AI as an agent, capable of handling tasks autonomously. This was AI that we could set to a task – tell it what to do, and let go. It could handle customer contacts, analyze data, and automate repetitive tasks.</p>\n<p>And now there’s agentic coding. This is AI that can build AI. We can set up agentic coding using plain-text prompts, and the AI will devise the code to create the agent. It’s AI that understands what we want and how to get it done.</p>\n<p>As Wells Fargo analyst Ryan MacWilliams puts it, the market impact is only starting to be felt: “Investors underestimating how the launch of agentic coding in Feb. 2025&nbsp;has led to a wave of new AI development. Agentic coding automates AI agent builds, and drives significant coding productivity. Buy infrastructure SaaS, the AI build cycle is on.”</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, MacWilliams is recommending three stocks that are poised to benefit from a new AI boom. All three are linked to agentic AI and coding, and according to the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a>, all three have Strong Buy ratings from the Street. Here are the details on these Wells Fargo AI picks.</p>\n<p><strong>HubSpot, Inc.</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hubs/forecast\"><strong>HUBS</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with a look at the marketing software platform HubSpot. HubSpot has been in business since 2006, and has become one of the online marketing world’s go-to software platforms. The company offers its customers a set of cloud-based digital marketing tools purpose-built to solve the day-to-day issues that face marketers in fields like CRM, social media, content management, and the old stand-by, SEO. HubSpot’s unified platform is popular with inbound sales teams, direct marketers, and customer service experts.</p>\n<p>HubSpot built its reputation on the innovative nature of its toolset. Users could automate a wide range of marketing functions, optimize ad placement, build newsletters and publish content, even build chatbots. In recent years, these tasks have proven highly amenable to AI enhancement, and HubSpot was quick to see that potential. The company developed Breeze, its AI assistant designed to work within the HubSpot platform.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, HubSpot is using recent advances in agentic AI to allow users to build or modify their own AI tools. These include customer agents, but the company has an array of new features in late stages of development. Prospecting agents, closing agents, personalization agents, data agents – all of these features are coming into play with HubSpot, to give users more flexibility in approaching online marketing. The key point – the agents will handle the time-consuming ‘busy work,’ allowing the human behind the scenes to make better decisions based on more accurate data in real time.</p>\n<p>Like many online subscription services, HubSpot operates on the ‘freemium’ model, giving its registered users an array of basic tools free of charge while reserving the more advanced features for paid subscribers. The model has proven successful; many users are satisfied with the free tools, and their use of HubSpot provides a base for word-of-mouth advertising, while the subscription users provide the company with a sound financial base.</p>\n<p>HubSpot last reported financial results for 2Q25, and in that period showed a top line of $760.9 million. This was up 19% year-over-year and came in $20.8 million better than had been expected. The company’s success was driven by its subscription revenue, which at $744.5 million was up 19% year-over-year. HubSpot’s earnings, $2.19 per share by non-GAAP measures, were 7 cents per share better than had been forecast, and the company had $1.9 billion in liquid assets available at the end of Q2.</p>\n<p>We should note here that HubSpot’s stock is down right now, showing a 35% year-to-date loss. The most recent hit to the stock came last week, when OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced a new set of software tools for marketing and customer contact use. This represents a direct challenge to companies like HubSpot – although HubSpot, which has been working on AI features for over a year now, has the resources to meet such a challenge.</p>\n<p>That is the view of Ryan MacWilliams. In his write-up of HubSpot for Wells Fargo, the analyst notes that the company has proven capable of developing quality tools on a fast timeline, and that gives it an advantage in a challenging environment. MacWilliams writes, “Our working thesis is that HUBS can add agentic use cases in a reasonable period before a competitor gets to comparable scale/breadth of the platform. HubSpot’s installed base, customer data, and partner ecosystem give it a leg up on distrubution/integrations out of the gate. While there will certainly be heightened competition as entrants try to build new agentic solutions, we believe HUBS is attractively positioned to monetize agentic AI (and power users) at scale.”</p>\n<p>MacWilliams goes on to rate HUBS as Overweight (i.e., Buy), and gives the stock a $685 price target that suggests a one-year upside potential of 51.5%. (To watch MacWilliams’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/ryan-macwilliams\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>HubSpot’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 29 analyst reviews that include 26 Buys against 3 Holds. The shares are priced at $451.87, and their $686.74 average target price implies a 52% gain in the year to come.

            "title": "Apple or Super Micro Computer: Bernstein Selects the Top AI Hardware Stock to Buy",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>While AI may interact with us through software, it still relies on a physical backbone – processor chips, server stacks, and device interfaces that bring it to life. Bernstein analyst Mark Newman understands this dynamic and has been closely watching the AI hardware sector.</p>\n<p>“Hardware stocks have historically lagged overall tech in large part because hardware companies have struggled to grow. That said, hardware stocks offer high dispersion, creating opportunities for near-term Alpha generation, while the potential for AI re-rating and broader growth reacceleration offer longer-duration opportunities,” Newman opined.</p>\n<p>“Although near-term concerns of an AI-bubble persist,” the analyst added, “we see huge upside in the long-term for IT hardware. While there is a huge range of outcomes, we land at $1.3T for enterprise inference in the 2030 base case (67% 25-30E CAGR).”</p>\n<p>Putting these themes into action, the Bernstein expert looks closely at Apple <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast\"><strong>NASDAQ:AAPL</strong></a><strong>)</strong> and Super Micro Computer <strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/smci/forecast\"><strong>NASDAQ:SMCI</strong></a><strong>)</strong>, two companies with strong positions in AI-capable hardware. Let’s dive in and find out which one the analyst has selected as the right AI hardware stock to buy right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>\n<p>First up, Apple needs little introduction – it is a household name everyone is familiar with. The tech giant got its start in the 70s, when it helped to launch the very idea of personal computing, and later its early Macintosh computers introduced the mouse pointer and the GUI that are now ubiquitous. Today, the iPhone and iPad, along with the MacBook line, have a devoted following, giving the company a user base one billion strong.</p>\n<p>The company was the first on Wall Street to reach a one trillion dollar market cap; its current market cap of ~$3.8 trillion makes it the third-most valuable publicly traded company in the US and the company generated over $391 billion at the top line in its fiscal year 2024.</p>\n<p>As noted, Apple has a large and loyal customer base; this stems from a business model decision made by the company as far back as the 1980s, when its Mac computers introduced a series of innovations that quickly made them popular with graphics and publishing professionals – but that also made them incompatible with other computer operating systems. Since then, Apple has built an entire ecosystem based on its own devices, their quality and capabilities, and their users’ loyalty. The model has worked, and supports Apple’s reputation for quality and its solid position as a leader in the world of personal technology.</p>\n<p>Apple hasn’t just leaned on its product sales. The company has created an array of services to back them up, including the Apple Store, streaming music and TV, cloud computing, and even an online payment service. The company is supplementing its services with AI technology, and recently released the latest updates to its Apple Intelligence.</p>\n<p>While the company has developed its ecosystem as its own entity, it does communicate with the larger digital world. Apple has created the Safari web browser, and has received multi-billion-dollar payments from Google to ensure that Safari defaulted to Google as the search engine of choice. Apple dodged a bullet here recently when a federal judge allowed Alphabet to keep paying to have Google Search set as the default search engine.</p>\n<p>Turning to Apple’s recent financial results, we find that the company last reported for fiscal 3Q25, the period that ended this past June 28. Apple generated record June quarter revenues of $94 billion, up 10% year-over-year and ahead of the forecast by $4.88 billion. Apple’s EPS, of $1.57, was up 12% year-over-year and came in 14 cents per share better than had been expected.</p>\n<p>Bernstein’s Newman likes what’s on offer here and sees a path to future gains. The analyst writes, “As the gateway to the Intelligence Revolution, Apple is well positioned to reap rewards from AI. We believe that the Google remedies decision not only clears a significant downside risk, but opens the path for Apple to leverage Gemini’s AI, ruling out the most severe downside cases… We continue to view Apple’s core asset – the most lucrative and sticky 1 billion users as highly attractive, which provides significant potential upside from AI if executed well. With &gt;2.35B devices and ~1B unique users currently onboarded on Apple’s platform, an ever-growing installed base and above-industry margins, the value of the Apple brand and its ecosystem speaks for itself.”</p>\n<p>Newman goes on to rate AAPL shares as Outperform (i.e., Buy), with a $290 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of ~13%. (To watch Newman’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-newman\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, Apple has picked up a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, based on 34 recent reviews that include 18 to Buy, 14 to Hold, and 2 to Sell. At a current price of $257.13, however, the $255.27 average target leaves no room for upside.
