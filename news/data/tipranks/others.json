In a bizarre kind of way, that kind of outstanding performance has become par for the course for the chip giant, and investors’ reaction to the print has been a negative one, with shares down 5% in Thursday’s trading as of writing. Right now, the market seems reluctant to reward anything <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-related, no matter the strength on display.</p>\n<p>The Street’s biggest NVDA bull, however, has no such issues. “We view the risk/reward positive post a beat/raise quarter,” said Evercore’s Mark Lipacis, an analyst ranked among the top 1% on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Lipacis thinks the stock will outperform eventually as investors gain clarity on two key concerns. The first is whether CapEx growth can continue beyond 2027. In short, Lipacis thinks it can. While many liken today’s AI spending to the Internet bubble of 2000, Lipacis points out two crucial distinctions: first, the Internet was a medium “looking for an app,” whereas AI is the application in search of compute cycles; second, internet infrastructure spending happened before returns were realized, while AI investment is being funded by actual returns. For instance, AI spending has driven a 35%-90% rise in revenue per employee over the past three years at hyperscalers, reducing costs in both software and headcount. The analyst believes AI-driven savings on $60 trillion in global OpEx are already financing current AI investments. In other words, AI CapEx isn’t entirely new spending – it’s largely a reallocation, shifting money from enterprise OpEx to the CapEx of hyperscalers, neoclouds, model developers, and enterprises. With current hyperscale CapEx at $1 trillion, less than 2% of global OpEx, Lipacis thinks there is “more to go.”</p>\n<p>The second concern is whether demand for AI tokens can sustain its “parabolic growth.” Here, too, Lipacis believes it can. Agentic AI represents a “change in the paradigm” for compute demand. In prior computing eras, such as PCs or smartphones, demand was constrained by the number of people – 8 billion people can only purchase so many devices. With Agentic AI, multiple autonomous agents can operate simultaneously on behalf of individuals or businesses, interacting with other agents in parallel. This creates virtually unlimited demand for AI tokens. “Agentic AI has only just started, we expect parabolic growth demand for tokens will continue,” the 5-star analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Lipacis maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, alongside his Street-high price target of $352, implying the stock will gain 90% in the year ahead. (To watch Lipacis’ track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-lipacis\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NVDA stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 36 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each. At $272.65, the average target offers 12-month upside of 47%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Analysts expect a bump when the Q1 numbers come in and the effects of the understated Federal Government shutdown finish rippling through.</p>\n<p>The big news, however, was the Supreme Court decision striking down most of President <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a>’s tariff regime. That was the wildcard, and we still don’t know how it will affect the game. The President has already indicated that he’ll simply levy a global blanket <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> of at least 10%. In the meantime, businesses and importers who have already paid some $170 billion in aggregate tariffs to the US Treasury will be looking to pull some of that back.</p>\n<p>Watching this situation from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus sees reason for optimism – and a place to look for sound stock picks. He writes, “Many market participants are increasingly recognizing that indeed uncertainty remains at the core of the day-to-day life of the markets as it does in the lives of its participants. Periods of price volatility offer opportunity ‘to catch babies thrown out with the bath water’&nbsp;in periods of market downdrafts and present opportunities to respond rather than opt for knee jerk reactions.”</p>\n<p>The stock analysts at Oppenheimer are running with this thesis – they’ve picked out beaten-down stocks that appear ready to bounce back in a resilient market environment, and their notes make interesting reading. Let’s take a look at two of their choices, and with some help from the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks database</a>, we can see whether the general Street consensus aligns with the Oppenheimer analysts’ view. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Freshworks</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/frsh/forecast\"><strong>FRSH</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>The first stock on our list of Oppenheimer picks is a software-as-a-service company, Freshworks. Founded in 2010 in India, Freshworks builds and delivers software systems designed to ‘uncomplicate’ enterprise users’ IT and customer service systems. IT and customer service are two of the vital digital functions in any modern enterprise, and Freshworks uses <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> and intuitive management to simplify them both.</p>\n<p>That approach has earned the company a solid audience. Freshworks boasts that it has over 74,000 customers in more than 120 countries; that last year, it saved its customers over 1.3 million work-hours in support workflows; and that its AI agents and copilots deliver measurable and significant improvements in productivity times and resolutions.</p>\n<p>Freshworks can claim some major names on its customer list, including S&amp;P Global, Klarna, Forbes, and Bridgestone. The company can also boast solid earnings and a trend of rising revenues. Nevertheless, the stock is down 40.5% year-to-date.</p>\n<p>Much of that loss tracks back to the general threats facing the enterprise software sector. Competition is fierce in the industry, and the emergence of AI, especially agentic and generative AI models, is both a promise and a threat. The promise is that these technologies will open new vistas of opportunity for increased profits; the threat is that current customers will start to adopt the new AI models in-house and reduce the demand for SaaS operators’ products.</p>\n<p>For now, though, the company is reporting solid results. In 4Q25, the last period reported, Freshworks’ revenue came to $222.7 million, up more than 14% year-over-year and beating the forecast by a $4 million margin. The company’s bottom line of $0.14 per share in non-GAAP measures was 3 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>Those strong results form the starting point for Oppenheimer’s Brian Schwartz, who writes of the software firm, “Freshworks delivered a good quarter in 4Q25. The quarter strength was driven by momentum across the EX business and AI products. 4Q25 results also show a record gross margin, and the top-line outperformance flowed through to higher profits. Negatively, 4Q and 2026 guidance show down operating margins as management invests for future growth. Also, 104% constant-currency NRR in 4Q and 105% 1Q guide indicates a meaningful recovery in expansions activity is further out, and may feed an AI bear narrative on Freshworks’ seat-based model. Bottom Line: Freshworks is showing good consistency in revenue growth and profit margins, and generating a lot of cash. In our view, the latter supports management instituting greater capital returns to shareholders given low multiples and strong balance sheet.”</p>\n<p>The analyst goes on to rate FRSH stock as Outperform (Buy), with a $15 price target that indicates room for 106% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/brian-schwartz\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Right now, Freshworks has 12 recent analyst reviews on file, and the 6-6 split between Buy and Hold gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $7.28, and their $12.89 average price target implies a 77% gain by this time next year.

Lee believes this additional spending is driven by sharply higher memory prices and does not indicate that hyperscalers are redirecting their capital spending from GPUs to ASICs. Meanwhile, Street revenue forecasts for major memory companies have also been increased by roughly $157 billion over the same period. As there has been no adjustment in CoWoS capacity allocation, Lee’s GPU revenue projections remain unchanged for now.</p>\n<p>As for the results, Lee anticipates Nvidia will report Q4 revenue of $68.0 billion, which is 5% higher than the guide and 3% above Visible Alpha (VA) consensus estimates of $65 billion and $66 billion, respectively. With the GB300 continuing to ramp up into FY27e, Lee forecasts 1QFY27 revenue of $74.0 billion, 3% above VA consensus of $71.8 billion. He sees revenue surpassing expectations despite ongoing uncertainty around China exports, with Lee’s estimates excluding any revenue from China.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lee thinks server CPU could potentially be a “new narrative.” Amid the recent surge in server CPU demand fueled by the growth of agentic AI, Nvidia unveiled a groundbreaking agreement with Meta for a large-scale rollout of its Grace CPUs, with Vera CPUs expected to follow in the future. “It remains too early to quantify the opportunity but this could potentially drive a re-examination of datacenter revenue estimates,” said the analyst.</p>\n<p>With the March GTC event approaching, Lee anticipates attention will return to Nvidia’s AI GPU roadmap, including the ramp of GB300 and the next-generation Rubin, which is on track to scale in 2H26. The analyst also remains optimistic about the AI GPU total addressable market expanding beyond traditional hyperscalers. His FY27e and FY28e datacenter revenue forecasts of $351 billion and $434 billion remain 12% and 8% above Street estimates, respectively.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Lee maintained a Buy rating on the shares, although he lowered his price target from $320 to $310, reflecting a revision of the target PE from 30x to 29x (this adjustment is based on the company’s five-year historical average PE, which has now fallen to 29x). Lee’s new target factors in 12-month returns of 57%. (To watch Lee’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/frank-lee-cfa\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Barring one NVDA bear, all of Lee’s colleagues are also bulls, with the additional 32 Buys all naturally coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $268.57 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 36% premium. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Total potential spending from Meta is expected to reach tens of billions. </p>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, AMD granted Meta a performance-based warrant covering as many as 160 million shares of its common stock. The warrant vests in stages linked to Instinct GPU shipment targets, beginning with the first 1 GW delivered and continuing in additional tranches as Meta expands purchases toward the full 6 GW. Vesting also depends on AMD meeting certain stock price thresholds, and Meta’s ability to exercise the warrant is subject to the achievement of specified technical and commercial milestones.</p>\n<p>AMD shares jumped in response to the news, but what does the deal do for Meta? BofA’s Justin Post, an analyst ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, looks at both the positives and negatives here.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, there is “supplier diversification,” as a multi-vendor approach should strengthen “pricing leverage” and contribute to lower long-term compute costs. Second, the warrant structure offers potential financial upside: if AMD delivers operationally and its share price exceeds the required vesting levels, Meta could “realize meaningful equity value,” effectively offsetting a portion of its infrastructure spending. Lastly, securing infrastructure supply at scale positions Meta with the flexibility to extend beyond its core advertising business over time into AI subscriptions, enterprise solutions, or broader developer ecosystems.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are risks involved. The deal could keep capital spending elevated for an extended period, possibly through 2026–2029, limiting the company’s ability to adjust investments in the short to medium term. Rapid advances in AI chip technology also create a risk that newer architectures could outperform the GPUs Meta has committed to, meaning the capacity could become “economically suboptimal.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, higher fixed costs, combined with revenues still largely tied to the cyclical advertising market, could put pressure on margins if economic conditions weaken. While there is also a chance the partnership could influence supply from Nvidia, the 5-star analyst thinks this risk is likely small, given that most major hyperscalers are moving toward sourcing from multiple suppliers.</p>\n<p>All told, Post still rates META stock a Buy, while his $885 price objective implies shares will gain 37% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Post’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-post\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>This stock gets plenty of support elsewhere on the Street; based on a mix of 39 Buys and 4 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the shares a Strong Buy. At $864.62, the average target factors in 12-month returns of 33%. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/meta/forecast\">See Meta stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Progress in developing Amazon’s own large language models could also boost investor confidence.</p>\n<p>But one specific area Post homes in on as a potential driver of sentiment is AWS. The cloud computing platform has doubled its power capacity since 2022, and during the 4Q25 earnings call, Amazon reported that it added 3.9 gigawatts in 2025 alone, with plans to double capacity again by 2027. This expansion contributed to an acceleration in revenue growth, rising from 17% year-over-year in 2Q25 to 24% in 4Q25, and Post’s capacity projections indicate that AWS could drive future revenue growth above current Street estimates. Microsoft has also noted that capacity additions often serve as a revenue guide, further boosting Post’s confidence, while 4Q25 agreements with OpenAI and the US government suggest Amazon is well-positioned to compete for AI capacity deals moving forward.</p>\n<p>Post’s analysis (based on Amazon’s commentary and historical capex data) suggests AWS could expand its power capacity to over 31 GW by the end of 2027, up from roughly 15 GW in 3Q25. If revenue per added GW remains steady at $5.4 billion, Post thinks AWS could see revenues of $164 billion in 2026 and $209 billion in 2027. This implies upside of 2% in 2026 and 5% in 2027 vs. Street estimates of $161 billion and $199 billion, translating to 27% and 28% growth for those years, above the Street’s 25% and 24%. “While revenue yields on capacity could be impacted by shifts to AI workloads and competitive pricing, we think favorable demand trends will support revenues,” the 5-stat analyst said.</p>\n<p>Post does point out the risks to these estimates. He reckons hyperscalers will invest $1.2 trillion in capex over the next two years, up from $534 billion in 2024–2025, which could push data center construction costs higher and create excess industry capacity. This unprecedented expansion is likely to increase input costs – JLL estimates data center construction expenses have grown about 7% annually – and could lead to more competitive pricing, putting pressure on industry revenues.</p>\n<p>That, however, does not affect Post’s bullish stance.

            "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Every investor looks at the market and wonders what to buy. That’s normal. It’s tempting to look to the experts for inspiration, and that’s also normal. And few experts have more to offer retail investors than the market’s legendary investors.

Originally from the Soviet Union, his family brought him to the US when he was 7. He started his career in financial trading in 1994, and in 2001 he founded his fund, Balyasny Asset Management, BAM. Today, Balyasny’s fund boasts some $32 billion in total AUM, and over 2,000 professionals working out of 20-plus global offices.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview, Balyasny made an interesting observation: that people are the most difficult issue to navigate in the financial trading business. As for market issues, he had a simple solution for difficulties: “You could just exit a position,” he said.</p>\n<p>So, let’s take a look at two of Balyasny’s positions, one that he’s exited and one that he’s opened. These are both companies focused on electric VTOL aircraft – a hot topic that aims to bring flying taxis to life. Balyasny’s positions involve <strong>Archer Aviation (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/achr/forecast\">NYSE:ACHR</a>) </strong>and <strong>Joby Aviation (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/joby/forecast\">NYSE:JOBY</a>)</strong>, two companies at the leading edge of this industry – and his actions may bring some light to bear on which stock is the better buy.</p>\n<p><strong>Archer Aviation</strong></p>\n<p>Archer Aviation, the first flying taxi stock we’ll look at here, was founded in 2018, and aims to develop an all-electric, short-hop air taxi for urban commuter routes – it describes the ‘target route’ as one which will take an hour or more by surface transport but can be reduced to a 10-minute hop or less by air. The trip from downtown Manhattan to Newark Airport is used by the company as an example.</p>\n<p>Archer’s prototype aircraft is dubbed ‘Midnight,’ and it features a battery-powered multi-rotor design to carry a pilot and four passengers, plus luggage, on a 20- to 50-mile route at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. The Midnight uses 12 rotors mounted on the wing; the forward rotors can tilt between level and vertical modes for take-off and landing operations. The use of multiple rotors is a redundancy-based safety feature.</p>\n<p>The company is currently advancing its Midnight aircraft through FAA regulatory processes for certification, with the aim of getting it cleared for commercial service. In the meantime, Archer is also making arrangements to start services in various cities around the country. Two recent examples: in December, Archer announced its plans for an air taxi network in Metropolitan Miami, to link the cities of Miami, West Palm Beach, Boca Raton, and Fort Lauderdale, and to connect the major international air travel hubs of Miami International Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and Palm Beach International Airport. This announcement was followed two weeks later by an announcement that Archer will be launching air taxi trials in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and New York under the White House’s eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP), a joint program of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>\n<p>We should also note that during 3Q25, Archer had sufficient resources to purchase LA’s Hawthorne Airport for $126 million in cash and finished the quarter with over $1.6 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand.</p>\n<p>When we turn to Dimitry Balyasny, we find that the hedge fund legend bought big into Archer recently. During 3Q25, he opened a position in this air taxi company, buying 1,276,177 shares; at current prices, this position is worth almost $9.2 million.</p>\n<p>Needham analyst Chris Pierce covers Archer and is impressed by the company’s sound position, realistic plans to expand, and its means to execute those plans. He writes of Archer, “With substantial balance sheet liquidity, ACHR retains flexibility to fund internal commercialization initiatives, advance its Georgia manufacturing ramp, and pursue targeted tuck ins across IP and composites, including defense adjacent opportunities. While OEM remains the core value driver vs peers levered to longer dated air taxi network operations, we view ACHR’s forward leaning posture (spanning defense, civil, public normalization efforts, and disciplined certification) as increasingly differentiated. Net, while timelines remain long and patience is required, the setup continues to favor companies with capital and regulatory credibility, and ACHR continues to check those boxes.”</p>\n<p>Pierce rates ACHR as a Buy, with a $10 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Pierce’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/chris-pierce\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Overall, Archer’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 3 recent analyst reviews that include 2 Buys and 1 Hold. The stock is priced at $7.19, and its $11.50 average target price points to a 60% gain over the coming year.

The deal involves AMD’s AI-focused Helios rack-scale systems, featuring the latest MI450 GPUs alongside Verona and Venice Gen6 EPYC CPUs, with initial deliveries slated to begin in the second half of 2026. Both Meta and OpenAI highlighted their early adoption of AMD’s Helios rack-based infrastructure built to OCP specifications, with Meta emerging as the first customer to deploy a customized AMD Instinct GPU tailored to its specific AI workload requirements.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, Meta will receive 160 million performance-based warrants that vest in stages over a five-year period. AMD noted that each gigawatt of deployed capacity equates to tens of billions of dollars in revenue.</p>\n<p>The equity-for-chips structure is another example of the industry’s circular dealmaking and echoes AMD’s October agreement with OpenAI, which allowed the ChatGPT maker to build a 10% stake in the company over time.</p>\n<p>Looking at the deal, Roth’s Suji Desilva, an analyst ranked among the top 2% on Wall Street, thinks it further cements AMD’s standing in the AI chip industry. “We believe expansion of AMD’s already deep Meta relationship, following a similar OpenAI announcement in October 2025, represents a further step forward in the company’s place as a source of large-scale AI infrastructure,” the 5-star analyst said.</p>\n<p>In what is a highly competitive AI accelerator landscape, Desilva believes AMD benefits from a workload-oriented product roadmap that allows it to position its offerings, when necessary, between a standard merchant GPU solution and a fully customized ASIC alternative.</p>\n<p>Desilva thinks AMD’s chiplet-focused custom GPU, which played a central role in getting Meta on board, amounts to a competitive differentiator, and also sees AMD’s Instinct GPUs, when integrated with its market-leading x86-based EPYC CPU portfolio, as well positioned to address emerging AI demands, particularly those tied to advanced agentic AI and reasoning-driven AI systems.</p>\n<p>“With equity stakes included in both the META and OpenAI deals, we now believe that two major industry players have a vested interest in bringing AMD’s offering to a meaningful share position versus competitive AI infrastructure offerings,” the analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>To this end, Desilva maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares, along with a $300 price target that points toward 12-month returns of 40%. (To watch Desilva’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sujeeva-de-silva\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the Street, the stock claims an additional 22 Buys and 8 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $285.07 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 33% premium. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast\">See AMD stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Year-to-date, then, the stock has shed 30%.</p>\n<p>That said, shares tilted into the green at the open of Tuesday’s session after the quantum computing company announced it secured a government contract under the Missile Defense Agency’s Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense initiative tied to the Golden Dome. IonQ did not disclose the specific value of its award but said the overall contract carries a ceiling of $151 billion. More than 2,400 companies are eligible to compete for future task orders issued under the SHIELD IDIQ contract structure.</p>\n<p>Investors will be hoping that the company’s Q4 earnings tomorrow (Feb 25) after the market close can further help shift sentiment.</p>\n<p>Heading into the print, Wedbush analyst Antoine Legault believes the odds are in favor of that happening. Given the sharp pullback, the analyst thinks “expectations are somewhat low,” and anticipates that any positive technological or financial development will be “well received by the market.”</p>\n<p>Specifically, Legault anticipates further updates on the timeline and development progress of the company’s upcoming 256-qubit system. Legault thinks the call is likely to center on qualitative and technical developments rather than detailed financial commentary, although he does expect management to outline its 2026 organic and inorganic revenue outlook, like IonQ did in 4Q24. As has often happened on prior earnings calls, there is also the possibility that the company makes additional announcements alongside the results.</p>\n<p>As for any M&amp;A news, Legault is looking for additional detail on the proposed acquisition of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> foundry SkyWater Technology, particularly regarding the expected closing timeline, as well as updates on the January acquisition of Seed Innovations, a software and R&amp;D firm, and the previously announced November acquisition of Skyloom. Recall that when IonQ disclosed its proposed SkyWater transaction at the end of January, it indicated that full-year 2025 revenue was tracking toward the high end or potentially above its $106 million to $110 million guidance range. Legault is calling for $109.7 million for the full year, including $41.6 million in Q4. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Still, Legault thinks financial performance is secondary to technological execution and believes that new customer wins and broader <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-driven market momentum will “continue to be the main driver of share performance in the near-term.”</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Legault maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $60 price target. That implies the stock will gain 93% in the year ahead. (To watch Legault’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/antoine-legault\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>That exuberant target is actually below the Street’s average, which lands at $72.75, and factors in a one-year gain of 134%. On the rating front, based on a mix of 7 Buys and 3 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy.

While memory availability could stay tight and pricing elevated in the intermediate term, thereby constraining smartphone supply and demand dynamics, Mobley makes the case that supply chains typically adjust and find “some sort of equilibrium” over time. Earlier this year, Chinese smartphone OEMs tightened inventory controls as the memory shortage became more pronounced. But over time, these OEMs may gradually relax inventory discipline as the ecosystem adapts to ongoing memory constraints and a structurally higher bill of materials.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, by this point next year, Qualcomm’s sales exposure to Samsung should be comping against a steady 75% share, rather than reflecting the step-down from 100% share seen this year. In addition, its chip shipments to Apple are expected to represent less than 10% of total revenue by then, excluding any QTL patent licensing revenue collected from Apple.</p>\n<p>Finally, within that same timeframe, investors are likely to have greater conviction in the outlook for FY29, where Automotive and IoT revenue could approach or potentially surpass Handset revenue for the first time, marking a “milestone in QCOM’s diversification path.”</p>\n<p>Against the backdrop of this potential shift in sentiment, and given the year-to-date decline in QCOM shares, Mobley has now upgraded his rating from Hold to Buy. Mobley’s $185 price target implies shares will climb 28% higher in the months ahead. (To watch Mobley’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/gary-mobley\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>On a side note, Mobley thinks the company will hold an analyst day in June, when the company should outline progress in expanding non-smartphone revenue streams and offer additional detail on its data center roadmap, including platforms such as AI200 and AI250. Ahead of the event, he thinks it is probable that Qualcomm announces another data center customer, adding to HUMAIN.</p>\n<p>So, that’s the Loop view, but what does the rest of the Street have in mind for this chipmaker? Based on an additional 9 Buys, 12 Holds and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. Going by the $163.65 average target, the shares will gain 12.5% in the months ahead.

In a blog post, Anthropic pointed to COBOL functionality in its Claude Code platform, sparking renewed concern over AI’s potential to impact IBM’s traditional business lines. Anthropic emphasized that hundreds of billions of COBOL lines are still active in daily operations across sectors like finance, airlines, and government, and suggested that AI can now handle analysis tasks that previously made system upgrades slow and costly. Because COBOL is essential to critical systems such as payment processing and financial infrastructure – areas where IBM has historically been a key player – the news intensified fears that AI could reduce demand for legacy COBOL services.</p>\n<p>While investors fled on the prospect of more AI disruption, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is more sanguine, pointing out that IBM is “already disrupting itself.” It is doing so by “productizing AI-native modernization tools” designed to tackle the key issues in its install base, including a dwindling pool of COBOL developers and the complexity of decades-old business logic. Its watsonx Code Assistant for Z has been in use for over two years (generally available in 4Q23) and eases the typical hurdles of mainframe modernization by leveraging generative AI to convert COBOL into Java, interpret production code, and update applications while maintaining essential logic. Thill thinks that integrating these capabilities directly into the Z platform gives IBM a structural edge over general-purpose code assistants, which may be capable but lack native access to mainframe data, tools, and operational context. “More broadly,” Thill added,&nbsp;“IBM&nbsp;is positioning itself to live in a multi‑model, agentic world by partnering with providers like Anthropic, OpenAI and others. Those agents ultimately need to be infused into enterprise data &amp; hybrid cloud architectures, where&nbsp;IBM&nbsp;differentiates through its data layer, connectors, and platform integration.”</p>\n<p>Essentially, Thill says IBM remains a “software-driven story” with several long-term growth opportunities across hybrid cloud, AI, automation, and data. While mainframe software contributes significantly due to its strong margins and stability – making up roughly 23% of total revenue and 29% of software revenue in CY25 – it is not the “linchpin of&nbsp;IBM’s broader software reacceleration narrative.” The company’s goal of sustaining software growth above 10% is being fueled by expansions in areas such as Red Hat, watsonx, automation, and data platforms, which go far beyond the Z mainframe. “We view the sell-off as a near-term sentiment overhang on legacy services rather than an existential or structural risk,” the analyst summed up.</p>\n<p>To this end, Thill maintained a Buy rating on IBM shares, while his $370 price target points toward 12-month returns of 66%. (To watch Thill’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/brent-thill\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>11 other analysts join Thill in the bull camp, while an additional 5 Holds and 1 Sell all add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 51%, considering the average target clocks in at $337.53. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ibm/forecast\">See IBM stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company has met with banks in response to unsolicited approaches from potential buyers. At least one major competitor is reportedly evaluating a bid for the entire business, while other parties are said to be exploring the acquisition of select PayPal assets. The report added that the discussions remain at an early stage and may not lead to a deal. PayPal has not commented on the matter.</p>\n<p>The stock has faced sustained pressure in recent years, now sitting 86% below its 2021 peak. Earlier this month, shares declined 20% after the company issued a soft 2026 profit outlook, announced a CEO transition to replace Alex Chriss, and continued to grapple with intense competition across the digital payments landscape.</p>\n<p>Looking at the situation, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev says it is not surprising that interest is emerging at the current valuation, and believes the takeover attention “highlights PayPal’s intrinsic value.”</p>\n<p>“In our view at ~7x 2027E consensus EPS (vs. 20x+ 5-year avg.), PYPL is deeply undervalued given that it is one of four globally recognized payment networks alongside V/MA/AXP, has nearly $2tn of volumes including a 2-sided network with nearly 440mn active accounts and the most prominent US P2P network (Venmo) and a growing BNPL practice,” the analyst explained.</p>\n<p>Dolev maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $60 price target that points toward 12-month returns of 36%. (To watch Dolev’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/dan-dolev\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>For Raymond James analyst Madison Suhr, the most probable buyers are likely to be mega-cap tech companies such as GOOG, META, MSFT, AMZN, and AAPL. Stripe, which is privately held, could also represent a strategic fit, although it is unclear whether such a transaction would be feasible given the limited publicly available financial information on the company.</p>\n<p>However, Suhr is skeptical the deal will make it across the finish line. “In our view,” said the analyst, “a PE takeout is unlikely as this would likely be a $50B+ check size, and the ultimate exit strategy isn’t clear to us. Moreover, we estimate a mid-teens IRR at a $55 takeout price, which is not very compelling given elevated risks with the deal. That said, we acknowledge potential suitors may look to chop the business up or buy certain assets such as Venmo.”</p>\n<p>While a full sale of the company is unlikely, Suhr also thinks the reported interest is not surprising given the stock’s current valuation. For now, Suhr remains on the sidelines with a Market Perform (i.e., Neutral) rating with no fixed price target in mind.</p>\n<p>Most other analysts are also on the fence here; based on a mix of 26 Holds, 5 Buys and 4 Sells, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Hold. Going by the $51.29 average target, shares will climb 16% higher in the months ahead. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pypl/forecast\">See PYPL stock forecast</a>)</p>",

Truist analyst Arren Cyganovich, who is rated by <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks</a> among the top 5% of Wall Street’s experts, has recently picked out some high-yielding dividend shares – and both also show depressed share prices. It’s a trifecta of ‘Buy’ signals.</p>\n<p>The depressed share price offers an attractive point of entry; a high dividend yield – over 10% in these cases – promises a solid return on the purchase; and the top-ranked analyst’s imprimatur shows that these stocks are standing out from the pack.</p>\n<p>Keeping that in mind, let’s look at these two underperforming high-yield div stocks and see why the Truist expert is saying ‘Buy.’</p>\n<p><strong>Ares Capital Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arcc/forecast\"><strong>ARCC</strong></a>)</p>\n<p>We’ll start with a look at Ares Capital Corporation, a business development company, or BDC, that has been in operation since 2004. BDCs like Ares play a vital economic role, providing capital and financing to the small- and mid-sized businesses that tend to drive the US economy. In the years since its founding, Ares has put together what it describes as a balanced portfolio. As of December 31, 2025, this investment portfolio included 603 companies backed by 254 private equity sponsors. By fair value, the portfolio was worth $29.5 billion.</p>\n<p>Of Ares’ portfolio, more than half – some 60.5%, to be exact – is composed of first lien senior secured loans, and another 5% is in second lien senior secured loans. The remaining third of the portfolio consists of various instruments, including preferred equity securities and senior subordinated loans. A large portion of the portfolio, 23.8%, is in the software and services sector; health care equipment and services make up 11.3%, and commercial and professional services account for 9.4%. Overall, the portfolio features a diverse array of investment sectors and geographic exposure.</p>\n<p>Ares works to build a portfolio of high-quality borrowers that generate sound long-term returns. That strategy has allowed the company to consistently maintain a strong dividend payout. The company has been paying regular quarterly dividends since 2004 and has, at times, supplemented those with special dividends. The current dividend, scheduled to be paid on March 31, is set at 48 cents per common share. The annualized rate of $1.92 gives a forward yield of 10%.</p>\n<p>In its 4Q25 report, the most recent quarterly results released, Ares reported top-line revenue of $793 million. This was up 4.5% year-over-year, although it missed the forecast by $840,000. On the bottom line, Ares reported non-GAAP EPS of 50 cents per share – enough to fully cover the dividend and in line with pre-release expectations. We should note here that Ares’ stock is down 18% over the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>The Truist view is set out by Arren Cyganovich, who addresses investor fears, and lays out a case for buying in, writing following the recent earnings release: “With peaking concern about software exposure (24% of ARCC’s portfolio) management’s tone was confident both in the recent performance of its investments and the near- to medium-term outlook. While investors remain skeptical about the long-term outlook for software, we are more in ARCC’s camp seeing this more as a slow burn than a near-term fundamental impact to BDC portfolios – especially one with the long-term investing track record of ARCC… We believe that with two more cuts likely this year ARCC should be able to cover the dividend with earnings. Any potential near-term shortfalls can be covered by spillover taxable income estimated to be $1.38 per share.”</p>\n<p>Cyganovich rates ARCC shares as a Buy, and his $23 price target implies a one-year upside of 21%. Adding in the dividend yield, we’re looking at a potential total return of 31% by this time next year. (To watch Cyganovich’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/arren-cyganovich\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>ARCC shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on four unanimously positive recent analyst reviews. The stock is priced at $19.05, and its $21.75 average price target suggests it will gain 14% by this time next year.

Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski had taken a more balanced view of the stock’s prospects, but he has now officially changed his tune.</p>\n<p>Gawrelski has just upgraded his rating from Equal Weight (i.e., Neutral) to Overweight (Buy) and has also raised his price target from $354 to $387, suggesting the stock will gain 23% in the year ahead. (To watch Gawrelski’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/ken-gawrelski\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>“Capacity is king,” says the analyst, who sees “multiple new opportunities to capitalize on Google’s leadership in compute capacity, distribution and consumer data.”</p>\n<p>Gawrelski forecasts that Google will expand its compute capacity to 35GW by 2028, up from 15GW at the end of 2025, extending its capacity lead over other hyperscalers. The analyst notes that hyperscaler ambitions increasingly appear constrained by compute capacity. As this market dynamic continues over the medium term, Gawrelski expects Google will strengthen its competitive edge by further extending its capacity lead over peers. The analyst believes this growth in capacity will allow Google to “fulfill its ambitions” across GCP (Google Cloud) and its search, agentic, and autonomous businesses.</p>\n<p>To match his projected capacity growth, Gawrelski has raised his already well-above-consensus GCP estimates. The analyst now forecasts 2026 GCP revenue will grow 60% year-over-year, 11% above Street estimates, with 2027 and 2028 growth at 42% and 28% year-over-year, respectively, 16% and 12% above consensus. These forecast adjustments reflect the ongoing supply/demand imbalance in the industry, which indicates that supply “dictates revenue opportunity.” Gawrelski reckons GCP capacity will increase from 7.6GW in 2025 to 16.9GW by 2028. As a result, his cloud operating income estimates for FY26 and FY27 are now 10–15% above Street expectations.</p>\n<p>Gawrelski also factors into his projections a Gemini consumer subscription business he expects will reach $12 billion in ARR by the end of 2027, up from $4 billion at the end of 2025. There’s also potential upside from the Apple Siri partnership, likely contributing in 2027 or later, and possibly from TPU sales, although the analyst expects those to remain limited over the next few years since compute capacity is “highly strategic.” While the AI search transition remains a risk, with ChatGPT’s share holding steady around 13% since July 2025, Google has some breathing room to manage the shift. And what looked like a zero-sum game for engagement in early 2025 – market search instances up 9% while total Google (including Gemini) grew 3–4% – has now turned into a growing market, with search instances up 37% and total Google up 24% in January 2026.</p>\n<p>“Finally,” Gawrelski summed up, “count us as impressed by the accelerated pace of product innovation post conclusion of the DOJ search remedy hearing.”</p>\n<p>So, that’s the Wells Fargo view, but what does the rest of the Street make of Alphabet’s prospects? Based on a mix of 27 Buys and 6 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Strong Buy. The average target stands at $382.81, suggesting shares will gain 22% in the months ahead.

Novo’s latest obesity therapy combines a new molecule, cagrilintide, with semaglutide, the component behind its blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. The findings from the late-stage study add further scrutiny on Novo, which has ceded ground to Lilly in the pivotal US market.</p>\n<p>The sharp drop follows another decline earlier this month, when the company projected that net sales and profits could decline by as much as 13% this year, pointing in part to lower US pricing tied to an agreement with the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt\">Trump</a> administration aimed at reducing consumers’ drug costs.</p>\n<p>While the results seem to have taken the market by surprise, BofA analyst Sachin Jain says this is a “scenario we’d been uniquely flagging.”</p>\n<p>“We’ve been vocal that consensus c$14bn peak CagriSema sales could need revisiting, which we now see as high probability post-inferiority for REDEFINE-4,” the analyst said. “Moreover, we also note limited efficacy advantage in diabetes is a risk to consensus CagriSema forecasts, with recent REIMAGINE-2 data only showing a c0.1-0.2% HbA1c delta for CagriSema vs sema 2.4mg (Ozempic).”</p>\n<p>As such, Jain thinks the weaker-than-anticipated CagriSema readout likely “raises the bar” on oral semaglutide sales, even though the launch has started strongly. Essentially, if CagriSema were to generate limited or no revenue in 2028E, roughly $7 billion in oral semaglutide sales would be needed to compensate, implying average weekly total prescriptions of about 450,000, broadly in line with current Zepbound prescription volumes.</p>\n<p>The initial rollout of oral semaglutide has exceeded forecasts, with prescription trends running “well ahead of expectations.” Physician feedback on Novo’s oral semaglutide indicates it could capture around 50% market share, underpinning a peak sales opportunity of approximately $12 billion, based on BofA’s recent survey work. That said, Jain thinks several variables are likely to influence the rollout. These include the post-Orforglipron (LLY’s oral drug) PDUFA decision on April 10th and whether that supports a broader global expansion vs. a more limited US and select EU strategy; the prospect of “injectable cannibalisation,” with clinicians estimating that such transitions account for 43% of uptake; and questions around treatment duration and dose escalation, as doctors continue to “flag persistence issues.”</p>\n<p>“Our two key areas of concern (FY26 guidance and potential for REDEFINE-4 inferiority) have now played out negatively,” Jain summed up, although that does not alter his stance. The analyst maintained a Neutral rating on the shares along with a $55.30 (350 DKK) price objective. That said, the figure now makes room for solid gains of 38% over the next year. (To watch Jain’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sachin-jain\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>3 of Jain’s colleagues join him on the sidelines, yet with an additional 4 Buys and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. Going by the $56 average target, a year from now shares will be changing hands for a 40% premium. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo/forecast\">See NVO stock forecast</a>)</p>",

In fact, Vinh has now lifted his F4Q revenue forecast from $66.8 billion to $69.0 billion, compared with the Street at $65.7 billion.</p>\n<p>The primary catalysts will be rising B300 and GB300 shipments, although supply constraints could cap more substantial upside. The analyst anticipates that higher volumes of Blackwell Ultra (B300/GB300) will provide the overall lift, supported by both unit growth and ASP expansion, with the B300 carrying a 20–30% premium to the B200. Increased rack shipments should also contribute meaningfully, as Vinh estimates Nvidia is on pace to deliver just under 30,000 racks this year.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the 5-star analyst is modeling F4Q Data Center revenue of $63.7 billion, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, with Compute revenue of $54.6 billion, up 27% QoQ. For F1Q, his forecasts stand at $69.1 billion for Data Center, up 8% sequentially, and $59.3 billion for Compute, up 8.5% QoQ. On the other hand, GDDR memory shortages are expected to weigh on Gaming shipments.</p>\n<p>Vinh also anticipates that shipments of the H200 to China will represent a meaningful revenue component in both the FQ4 results and the guide. For the quarter, he estimates the H200 will contribute $3.5 billion to $4 billion, with a further $2 billion to $3 billion expected to be reflected in the F1Q outlook.</p>\n<p>Given the revised estimates, Vinh’s FY26 revenue forecast rises from $215 billion to $217 billion, compared with consensus at $213 billion, while his FY27 forecast moves up from $355 billion to $359 billion vs. the Street at $331 billion.</p>\n<p>So, down to business, what does this all ultimately mean for investors? Vinh maintained an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares, backed by a $275 price target. The figure suggests upside of 45% from current levels. (To watch Vinh’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/john-vinh\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Of the 31 other analysts that have recently posted NVDA reviews, 1 rates the stock a Sell, but all 30 others say Buy, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year returns of 40%, considering the average target clocks in at $265.63. (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvda/forecast\">See Nvidia stock forecast)</a></p>",

U.S. comparable sales rose 4.6%, slightly above the Street’s 4.3% forecast and up from 4.5% in the third quarter. Adj. EPS came in at $0.74, ahead of the $0.73 expected by the analysts.</p>\n<p>Consolidated gross margin expanded by 13 basis points year-over-year, an improvement from the 2-basis point increase recorded in Q3. The margin performance was primarily driven by a 17-basis point YoY gain in Walmart U.S.</p>\n<p>The company also announced a new $30 billion share repurchase authorization, which is likely to be deployed over the next three to four years.</p>\n<p>For the FY27 outlook, Walmart guided for net sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, below the 4.9% anticipated on Wall Street, operating income growth of 6% to 8%, and adj. EPS of $2.75 to $2.85, compared with the analysts’ $2.96 estimate.</p>\n<p>Despite the below-consensus guide, the FY27 outlook implies stronger topline and profit growth than was assumed in the company’s initial FY25 and FY26 guides. Management said its objective is to outperform the stated targets, but emphasized that it is prudent to begin the year with a conservative stance given what it described as a somewhat unstable operating backdrop.</p>\n<p>For Roth analyst Bill Kirk, the performance amounted to a demonstration of strength. “Underlying trends remain strong. Walmart’s automatization opportunities, data capabilities, and consumer proposition are a rare combination that supports market share gains AND increased profitability,” the analyst said.</p>\n<p>Kirk believes Walmart is increasingly pulling ahead of traditional brick-and-mortar rivals, driven by upgraded stores, a best-in-class digital ecosystem spanning marketplace, delivery, logistics, and subscriptions, and a fast-scaling advertising business. The integration of Vizio’s model, which delivered triple-digit ad revenue growth, into the broader Onn platform is expected to further accelerate advertising momentum. “Importantly,” Kirk adds, “it broadens the potential advertiser base to include partners that would not have traditionally advertised within Walmart’s physical stores or even on walmart.com.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, when combined with structural cost efficiencies from automation, the advertising opportunity strengthens Walmart’s ability to take share. Notably, Kirk reckons Walmart’s ad revenue as a percentage of GMV remains at less than half the level of industry peers.</p>\n<p>To this end, Kirk maintained a Buy rating on the shares and raised his price target from $108 to $138, suggesting the stock will gain 12% in the months ahead. (To watch Kirk’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/bill-kirk\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Most analysts agree with that stance. Based on a mix of 27 Buys vs. 2 Holds, the consensus view is that this stock is a Strong Buy. The $138.32 average target closely matches Kirk’s objective.

In the U.S., companies raised $46 billion through IPOs, the strongest showing since the 2021 peak. Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs expects a significant acceleration, forecasting that U.S. IPOs in 2026 could raise around $160 billion.</p>\n<p>Several forces appear to be supporting the recovery. Investors are anticipating potential listings from high-profile private companies, including SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic. At the same time, signals from the SEC suggest that regulatory adjustments may create a more favorable environment for companies considering going public.</p>\n<p>Against that backdrop, it’s worth taking a closer look at a pair of last month’s new market entrants, both of which have already earned Buy ratings from Wells Fargo. But what does the broader Street think? We turned to the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> for the full picture. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p><strong>BitGo Holdings (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/btgo/forecast\"><strong>BTGO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first new stock on our list is the digital asset company BitGo. This company has been in business since 2013, and its prime services, offered through its main platform, are in trading, financing, collateral management, and transaction settlement. The company delivers the advantages of deep liquidity and flexible credit through secure infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In addition, BitGo offers an array of other services. The company can integrate with leading digital exchanges and capital providers, to smooth out day-to-day operations; it can orchestrate stablecoin deposits and payments through its online wallet system; those wallet services are secure, flexible, and controllable; and BitGo makes available a full suite of <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency\">crypto</a>-as-a-service digital asset solutions.</p>\n<p>In short, BitGo has positioned itself as a provider of digital assets support through the ongoing, and increasing, digital transformation of the financial system. The company has $104 billion in assets on its platform, supports more than 1,500 digital asset types, and boasts over 4,900 clients in its ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In January of this year, BitGo announced that it had broken some additional new ground, becoming the ‘first publicly traded, federally chartered digital asset infrastructure company.’ That announcement followed the company’s January 22 debut on Wall Street. BitGo put 11,821,595 shares on the market, at an initial price of $18 each, and raised nearly $213 million in gross proceeds. Since then, the stock has fallen by 43%, but even after those losses, BitGo still has a market cap of more than $1.25 billion.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo analyst Cassie Chan takes an upbeat stance on this digital asset company, writing, “We are Overweight rated on BTGO as we believe BitGo has established itself as a trusted, specialized custodian in a fast-growing crypto market that has quickly hit &gt;$4T market cap. BitGo has &gt;4,900 institutional clients, and supports 1,550+ digital assets in 100+ countries across liquidity, lending, custody, staking, and infrastructure solutions. Increasing adoption and growth of crypto to come from increased regulation and penetration of real world assets (crypto market &lt;3% of equities market).”</p>\n<p>Chan’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating is accompanied by a $13 price target that suggests a one-year gain of 29% from current levels. (To watch Chan’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/cassie-chan\">click here</a>.)</p>\n<p>Overall, BTGO shares have earned a Strong Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, based on 13 recent reviews with an 11 to 2 split that favors Buy over Hold. The stock is priced at $10.51 right now, and its $15.88 average price target points to a 51% gain on the one-year horizon.

Quantum hardware is significantly more complex and costly to manufacture than conventional <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> chips. Many systems must also operate at extremely low temperatures, requiring specialized cryogenic infrastructure that adds to overall expense and operational complexity.</p>\n<p>Despite these hurdles, interest in the technology continues to build. Quantum computing is being explored for applications in <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>, optimization, materials science, and cloud-based services. According to Precedence Research, the global quantum computing market reached $1.44 billion last year and is projected to expand to $19.44 billion by 2035, implying an approximate 30% compound annual growth rate. North America accounted for roughly 61% of the market.</p>\n<p>TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar, ranked by TipRanks among the top 1% of Wall Street analysts, has been closely tracking developments in the sector. After examining two of the leading public players, Rigetti Computing (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rgti/forecast\">NASDAQ:RGTI</a>) and D-Wave (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/qbts/forecast\">NYSE:QBTS</a>), the analyst has identified one as his preferred quantum computing stock at this stage of the industry’s development. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>Rigetti Computing</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start in Berkeley, California, where Rigetti Computing has been bringing quantum computers from the drawing board to the real world since 2013. The company has its hands in all the main aspects of quantum computing systems, and designs, builds, and markets superconducting quantum integrated circuits and processor chips as well as the supercooled dilution systems which those products need to reach a functional quantum state.</p>\n<p>Rigetti currently has several commercially available quantum computers, and prides itself on offering flexibility to draw in customers. The company’s flagship system is Ankaa-3, which uses a non-modular chip, and it also offers a smaller quantum computer, Novera, a 9-qubit QPU, designed to operate as a stand-alone unit or linked in tandem. Novera allows customers to set up a boosted quantum computer that can be expanded as needs grow and that provides more power than a single small unit.</p>\n<p>The latest system from Rigetti, the modular Cepheus-1-108Q, is slated for commercial release by the end of 1Q26. The Cepheus system is based on twelve of the company’s 9-qubit chiplets, and was created to leverage Rigetti’s modular architecture to maximum advantage.</p>\n<p>Last month, Rigetti announced receipt of a new order from India to deliver a 108-qubit quantum computer to that country’s Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). This is the premier R&amp;D organization within the Indian government’s electronics and information tech ministry, and is scheduled to be installed on-site in Bengaluru during the second half of this year. The order is worth $8.4 million.</p>\n<p>We should note that Rigetti’s stock has been falling in recent months. The company faces headwinds, including high-level competition from major names such as IBM and Honeywell; lower-than-expected revenues combined with operating losses; and delays to the 108-qubit Cepheus system.</p>\n<p>This was visible in the last reported quarter, 3Q25. In that period, the company’s $1.9 million top line was down 19% from the prior year and missed the forecast by ~$223,000. At the bottom line, the operating loss for the quarter came to $20.5 million. The non-GAAP net loss of $10.7 million translated to a net loss per share of 3 cents.</p>\n<p><a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/screener/analysts-top-stocks\">Top analyst </a>Sankar takes a measured view of the company’s prospects. The 5-star analyst writes, “We see balanced risk/reward given premium valuation while it has lagged peers in revenue growth and scaling/fidelity rate metrics. Key risks to the story include cash burn and the possible need to raise capital in 1-2 years, a highly competitive market vs large tech companies (e.g., IBM, Google, Honeywell) and other quantum modalities such as ion traps, neutral atom, and photonics, and the scalability and fidelity rates of its own processor roadmap.”</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Sankar puts a Hold rating on Rigetti’s stock, but has no fixed price target in mind. (To watch Sankar’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/krish-sankar\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, this quantum computer company gets a Moderate Buy rating from the Street’s consensus, based on 7 reviews that include 5 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock is priced at $16.6, and its $38.75 average price target implies a robust 133% upside for the coming year.

Those are red flags investors need to recognize. In other instances, however, the pressure stems from temporary setbacks: a softer product cycle, tougher competition, or broader market volatility that sweeps up even solid companies.</p>\n<p>The real challenge is distinguishing between structural problems and short-term turbulence. No one can consistently time the exact bottom, but identifying quality names that have been repriced can tilt the odds in your favor.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we turned to the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to screen for stocks that have dropped sharply yet still get the backing of Wall Street analysts.

Unity offers its users a software platform for creating video games – and not just to create them, but also to expand them, to gather an audience, to create an interactive experience, and to make it available across all major mobile, PC, console, and XR platforms. In short, Unity plays a foundational role in a major segment of the computing industry.</p>\n<p>A short trip through Unity’s website shows that the company can offer a wide range of services, including 2D and 3D game creation, user acquisition apps so that creators can bring in an audience, and monetization apps that allow creators to generate revenue from their work. In addition, the Unity platform has applications in a wide range of non-gaming industries, including immersive training, retail, manufacturing, customer experience, and 3D training. Unity’s systems are compatible with both augmented and virtual reality devices, through designer and user interfaces.</p>\n<p>Unity’s own users have access to a range of interactive connections, including livestreams and discussions, to get the most out of the platform by finding out what other users are doing with it. It’s part of Unity’s overall commitment to providing transparency in the service.</p>\n<p>In its near-quarter century of operation, Unity has carved out a clear niche and built itself into an ~$8 billion company. In the second half of last year, Unity started to see its stock rise – but that trend reversed itself sharply in the last few weeks. The stock is now down 58% year to date.</p>\n<p>The company is facing headwinds from the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> industry, where mega-cap firms like Google are taking the lead in AI and interactive world generation. In a more recent headwind, Unity’s revenue outlook for 1Q26, reported last week, came in with a range of $480 million to $490 million, well below the $494 million expected on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>The soft outlook overshadowed a solid report. In 4Q25, Unity’s top line came to $503 million, up 10% year over year and beating the forecast by $10.18 million. The company’s bottom line, of 24 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, was 3 cents per share better than expected.</p>\n<p>Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang, in his recent note on Unity, explains why the stock remains a sound opportunity despite the headwinds. He says, “The recent sell-off, driven by fears that ‘world models’&nbsp;like Google’s Project Genie will displace game engines, is fundamentally misplaced and ignores the distinct architectural role Unity plays in development. We view the current valuation as disconnected from the company’s improving fundamentals, specifically the successful re-acceleration of the Grow segment via the Vector, and disciplined cost management. We view the current risk/reward profile as favorable. We believe U will see accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion in 2026, validating its role not as a victim of AI, but as a primary platform for its deployment.”</p>\n<p>Putting this into quantifiable terms, Yang rates the stock as Outperform (i.e., Buy), with a $32 price target that implies an upside of 72.5% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Yang’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/martin-yang\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The 20 analyst reviews on file for Unity include 15 to Buy, 4 to Hold, and 1 to Sell, giving the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. U shares are trading for $18.55, and the $37.53 average target price indicates potential for a robust 102% one-year upside.

The strategy can be effective when price strength reflects solid fundamentals – companies operating in attractive markets, generating healthy profits, and executing against durable business models. In such cases, upward trends are not just technical patterns but signals of underlying business momentum.</p>\n<p>Conviction tends to build further when leading Wall Street firms share that positive view. A review of the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> highlights two momentum stocks that have earned support from Morgan Stanley. The bank’s analysts see compelling reasons for further upside, making these names worth a closer examination.</p>\n<p><strong>TeraWulf (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wulf/forecast\"><strong>WULF</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>The first stock we’ll look at, WULF, represents a company that lives on the leading edge of today’s tech world – a combination of data centers, high performance computing, and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd\">bitcoin</a> mining. TereWulf has more than 30 years of experience drawing value from energy, and has five utility-scale data center facilities in operation. Two of these were built on the sites of coal-fired power plants, one on a repurposed industrial site; those locations bring advantages, allowing the company to make use of preexisting energy infrastructure without causing environmental damage.</p>\n<p>TeraWulf’s five data campus locations have an aggregate total of nearly 2.8 gigawatts of infrastructure capacity. The company’s Lake Mariner facility, the 750 megawatt campus in Barker, New York, is also the site of TeraWulf’s bitcoin mining operations. Approximately 90% of the power drawn by this facility comes from zero-carbon sources.</p>\n<p>Outside of bitcoin mining, TeraWulf makes its data centers available for contract operations, giving customers access to high-end, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a>-capable computing power based on low-cost and sustainable energy production, and supported by redundant fiber access and networking, and built in full compliance with energy, physical, and regulatory security standards.</p>\n<p>The AI boom of recent years has put a premium on quality data centers, and TeraWulf has been a direct beneficiary of that. The company’s stock has gained an impressive 243% over the past 12 months, the uptick coming against a backdrop of rising revenues.</p>\n<p>Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, analyst Stephen Byrd notes that the company provides a sound model for investors to gain access to the high-demand data center sector.</p>\n<p>“For investors seeking maximum exposure to DC growth, and who share our thesis that there is a large excess of demand for compute relative to supply, WULF is an attractive way to achieve such exposure,” Byrd opined.</p>\n<p>“TeraWulf has a strong track record of signing agreements with data center customers, and the management team has extensive experience in building a wide range of power infrastructure assets…. We project that the company will achieve success in converting the sites that currently do not have a Bitcoin-to-DC contract, at a present value that equates to ~$8/ watt (or an un-discounted value of $10/watt). We also assume that management achieves a 50% success rate in achieving the lower end of its targeted annual DC project growth of 250 MW/year in 2028-32,” the analyst added.</p>\n<p>Byrd follows up these comments by rating WULF as Overweight (i.e., Buy) with a $37 price target that implies a robust 129% gain in the coming months. (To watch Byrd’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/stephen-byrd\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>Overall, the Street gives this stock a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 6 recent positive reviews. The stock is priced at $16.18 and its $24.20 average price target indicates room for a 49.5% gain by this time next year.
