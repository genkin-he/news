Despite lower output, higher gas prices in Argentina lifted revenue to USD 9.9 million from USD 6.1 million, while a dispute over the Mata Magallanes Oeste and Cañadón Ramírez joint venture led Petrominera S.E. to terminate the agreement, prompting the company to assess ways to safeguard its contractual rights.</p>\n<p>To reinforce its balance sheet, bondholders approved changes to Interoil’s senior secured callable bonds, including payment-in-kind interest, a one-year maturity extension, eased reporting covenants, and consent to sell certain Argentine assets as part of a broader liquidity management effort. The company has since executed a strategic exit from its conventional Argentine operations, selling its stakes in the Santa Cruz Sur joint operations and the La Brea Block, alongside related rights in MMO and CR, to a local investor for up to USD 1.0 million in contingent payments plus an 80% overriding royalty on profits above defined production thresholds, reshaping its exposure to the Argentine market.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about InterOil Exploration and Production ASA</u></b></p>\n<p>Interoil Exploration and Production ASA is a Norwegian-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker IOX.
