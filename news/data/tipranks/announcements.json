Despite these pressures, the company cited its GRO AHT cost and revenue initiatives as driving more than $40 million of EBITDA improvement in 2025, including 2.4% growth in comparable Hotel EBITDA and over $13 million in corporate G&amp;A savings, though it nonetheless posted a 2025 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $215 million and negative AFFO.</p>\n<p>Management detailed an aggressive capital-structure and portfolio streamlining program, noting the payoff of remaining corporate-level debt in early 2025 and the completed sale of six hotels for about $145 million, plus agreements to sell three additional properties expected to generate significant capex savings and improve cash flow after debt service. The company also disclosed a maturity default on its $325 million JPM8 mortgage loan secured by eight hotels, while emphasizing that dispositions and potential handing back of assets could improve leverage and future capital needs, and reiterated that a special committee formed in early December 2025 is evaluating strategic alternatives to address the gap between the portfolio’s perceived value and the market price of its common stock.</p>\n<p>Operationally, Ashford reported that comparable hotel RevPAR fell 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2025 year-over-year, largely due to a federal government shutdown that began in October and drove a 27.9% decline in government-related room nights, with outsized impact on its Washington, D.C. exposure.

Revenue grew 17% to MNOK 1,775 on higher average cabin rates and solid demand, though fourth-quarter earnings were weighed by lower occupancy linked to a delayed sales campaign and heavier marketing spend aimed at boosting future bookings.</p>\n<p>Operating expenses increased 7% as the company expanded its onshore organisation and stepped up sales and marketing, while renegotiated bunkering agreements and LNG price movements helped contain fuel and port costs. A major debt refinancing of MEUR 456 secured 15-year vessel financing, cut the effective interest cost to about 10%, and improved financial flexibility even as reported accounting equity remained negative due to currency effects, contrasted with positive value-adjusted equity based on vessel market values.</p>\n<p>On the sustainability front, Havila Kystruten reduced CO2 emissions 36% versus its 2017 coastal route baseline and completed its first climate-neutral voyage using liquefied biogas and large battery packs, achieving about 92% lifecycle CO2 cuts and eliminating local NOx and SOx emissions on that trip. With 63% of 2026 capacity already booked as of February and cabin-night bookings nearly 20% above the prior year, management expects continued revenue growth and margin improvement supported by the 2025 investments in marketing, sales and organisational capabilities.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Havila Kystruten AS</u></b></p>\n<p>Havila Kystruten AS operates four modern cruise-passenger vessels along the Norwegian coastal route, combining government-contracted coastal transport with commercial passenger services and onboard sales.
