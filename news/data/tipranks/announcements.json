( <a data-ticker=\"AU:RAC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:rac\">(AU:RAC)</a> ) has shared an announcement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p>Racura Oncology Limited reported a sharp reversal in financial performance for the half year ended 31 December 2025, posting a net loss after tax of $4.1 million compared with a profit of $0.5 million a year earlier. The company did not declare or pay any dividends for the period, indicating a continued focus on conserving capital for operations and development activities rather than returning cash to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Despite the swing to loss, Racura’s net tangible assets per share improved to 11.71 cents from 10.39 cents, suggesting the balance sheet asset backing per security has strengthened. The absence of changes in control over entities and the lack of a dividend reinvestment plan point to a relatively stable corporate structure, with stakeholders’ attention likely to remain on how management steers the business back toward profitability while sustaining asset value.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:RAC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:rac\">(AU:RAC)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$2.00 price target.

The study underpins an initial 11-year mine life, with higher-intensity mining in the first two years to access higher-grade ore and build stockpiles that support later production.</p>\n<p>The DFS points to strong project economics, including high pre-tax NPVs, internal rates of return, and rapid payback periods under both spot and consensus silver price cases. With an all-in sustaining cost of A$39.70 per ounce and a relatively modest A$260 million peak funding requirement, the project is positioned as a high-margin, finance-ready development featuring sizable low-grade stockpiles that bolster downside protection and lender confidence.</p>\n<p>The ore reserves and mineral resources that support the production target have been prepared under the JORC Code by independent Competent Persons, reinforcing the technical foundations of the project. Paris also offers leverage to higher silver prices and sits within a 15-kilometre mineralised corridor, giving the company district-scale growth options via potential satellite deposits near the planned processing plant and tailings storage facility.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:IVR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:ivr\">(AU:IVR)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$0.12 price target.

Basic earnings per share jumped to 1.17 cents from 0.25 cents a year earlier, net tangible assets per share swung from a deficit to 1.42 cents, no interim dividend was declared, and the company recorded the loss of control of Medadvisor International Pty Ltd and Medicines Information Pty Ltd on 4 July 2025, signalling a reshaping of its corporate structure and balance sheet that underpins the improved metrics.</p>\n<p>The material improvement in profitability and net tangible assets, alongside the absence of dividends, suggests Adheris Health is prioritising balance-sheet repair and strategic refocusing following the divestment of key subsidiaries. These changes may strengthen the company’s financial position in the near term and could alter its market positioning within the digital health and medication adherence space, with implications for shareholders as the group transitions under its rebranded Adheris Health identity.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:AHE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:ahe\">(AU:AHE)</a> stock is a Sell with a A$0.02 price target.
