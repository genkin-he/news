The period swung to a net loss attributable to shareholders of HK$65.81 million, versus a profit of HK$26.59 million in the prior comparable period, reflecting sizeable expected credit loss allowances on rental deposits and trade receivables, a HK$36.70 million loss from fair value changes in investment properties, and finance costs of HK$10.88 million.</p>\n<p>The group booked a modest profit from discontinued operations of HK$1.99 million, which was insufficient to offset the deterioration in continuing operations, while total comprehensive expense attributable to owners reached HK$70.39 million as currency translation also turned negative. Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations fell to 2.45 Hong Kong cents, signaling a marked reversal in performance that underscores heightened balance-sheet and valuation pressures on its property assets and indicates a more challenging environment for shareholders and other stakeholders compared with the previous interim period.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0565\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0565\">(HK:0565)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$2.00 price target.
