Net tangible assets per share deteriorated further into negative territory, and the company signalled that its forthcoming audited financial statements may include a material uncertainty related to going concern, underscoring ongoing financial pressure and potential risks for shareholders and creditors.</p>\n<p>The preliminary report shows no changes in control over subsidiaries, no associates or joint ventures, and continued reliance on Australian Accounting Standards for any foreign operations, pointing to operational stability but limited growth. The absence of dividends for both the current and prior periods, combined with widening losses and negative net tangible assets, highlights that NoviqTech remains in a challenging financial position, with its long-term viability likely to come under close scrutiny when the audited accounts are released in March 2026.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Tymlez Group Ltd.</u></b></p>\n<p>NoviqTech Limited is an Australian-listed company that prepares its financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards, including for any foreign entities in its consolidated group.

This gain will be recorded as extraordinary income in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending February 2026, supporting the company’s bottom line despite weaker core operations.</p>\n<p>The company simultaneously revised its full-year forecast for FY2/2026, cutting projections for net sales, operating income, and ordinary income due to unseasonably high temperatures that delayed the Autumn/Winter season and dampened demand, as well as sluggish December and January trading and weak inbound spending from Chinese tourists. While profitability from ordinary operations is under pressure, Sanyo Shokai maintained its forecast for net profit attributable to owners of the parent, leveraging the one-off securities gain and share-related effects to stabilize earnings per share for shareholders.\n</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Sanyo Shokai Ltd.</u></b></p>\n<p>Sanyo Shokai Ltd., listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime, operates in the apparel and fashion sector, focusing on seasonal clothing lines that are sensitive to weather-driven consumer demand.
