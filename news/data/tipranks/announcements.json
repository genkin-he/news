Strong volume growth, successful integration of the Thailand assets and robust cash generation offset the drag from weaker oil prices and higher amortization, reinforcing the narrative of a business building scale with manageable balance-sheet risk.</p>\n<h2>Strong Volume Growth</h2>\n<p>Production and sales volumes rose sharply, up 26% and 25% versus the prior half, pushing output above 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. This volume expansion reflects both organic performance and the first meaningful contribution from the newly acquired Thailand assets, setting a higher operational base for the group.</p>\n<h2>Resilient Revenue and Earnings Metrics</h2>\n<p>Underlying revenue for the half reached $54.2 million, including $9.6 million from Thailand, while EBITDAX came in at $28.6 million, broadly flat on the prior half. That stability is notable given a 15% decline in realized oil price, indicating tight cost control and diversification benefits from gas-weighted assets.</p>\n<h2>Material Improvement in Operating Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>Cash flow from operating activities jumped 37% to $25.1 million, underlining the cash-generative nature of the portfolio despite softer prices. This was sufficient to fund the FY’25 final dividend of $15.9 million, reduce debt by $3 million and support $4.6 million of sustaining and development spend without stressing liquidity.</p>\n<h2>Thailand Acquisition: Immediate Scale and Low Costs</h2>\n<p>The Thailand acquisition, completed on 1 August 2025, delivered roughly 28% of group production over just five months and $9.6 million of revenue. These assets are particularly attractive given operating costs of about $7 per barrel of oil equivalent and early optimization at Nam Phong already delivering around a 7% production uplift.</p>\n<h2>Major Development Upside in Thailand</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted the final investment decision on the Nam Phong Booster Compressor as a key growth lever. Once online from mid‑2026, the project is expected to boost Nam Phong field production by at least 40%, providing material near‑term upside and further leveraging the low‑cost Thailand position.</p>\n<h2>Maari Permit Extension and Production Recovery</h2>\n<p>At Maari, a 10‑year permit extension to December 2037 significantly extends field life and underpins investment. Operationally, Maari delivered its strongest daily production in more than five years, with average half‑year output about 12% higher than the comparable period, signaling a meaningful recovery.</p>\n<h2>Mereenie Performance and Gas Sales Progress</h2>\n<p>Mereenie also performed well, with two recent infill wells contributing roughly a quarter of the field’s gas production. Improved realized gas pricing and a binding letter of intent with Power and Water Corporation create a pathway for firm gas sales through 2034, supporting plans for further infill drilling in 2026.</p>\n<h2>Low Cash Operating Costs and Balance Sheet Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Group cash operating costs remain around $20 per barrel of oil equivalent, positioning the company competitively through cycles. With cash of $35.6 million at 31 December 2025 and modest net debt of $9.8 million, Horizon is able to maintain an interim dividend of AUD 0.015 per share while funding development and working capital.</p>\n<h2>Record Calendar-Year Context</h2>\n<p>For calendar 2025, sales volumes were the highest in five years, underscoring the step‑change delivered by Thailand. Underlying revenue of $103.6 million and EBITDAX of $54 million highlight the consistency of earnings capacity even as the portfolio evolves, providing a solid platform for future growth projects.</p>\n<h2>Lower Realized Oil Price Impact</h2>\n<p>The main drag on reported results was a 15% fall in realized oil prices, which weighed on profitability. Calendar 2025 profit was limited to $8 million, reflecting not only the weaker price environment but also higher non‑cash amortization that compressed accounting earnings despite firm margins.</p>\n<h2>Acquisition Funding and Increased Leverage</h2>\n<p>The Thailand deal was largely funded with debt, and together with the FY’25 final dividend and a loan to a joint venture partner, it drove a reduction in cash and a shift to net debt of $9.8 million. Management framed this leverage as modest and manageable relative to cash flow, but investors will watch balance‑sheet discipline closely.</p>\n<h2>Operational Interruptions at Sinphuhorm</h2>\n<p>Not all assets ran at full tilt, with Sinphuhorm’s output temporarily constrained in August and September by planned maintenance at the EGAT power station. Management also flagged similar seasonal effects in February and March, though these interruptions are short‑term and primarily defer rather than destroy value.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing Projects Not Yet Realized</h2>\n<p>Several initiatives remain in execution or review, meaning their benefits are not yet in the numbers. These include the Block 22/12 liquids‑handling upgrade, evaluation of a multi‑well development at 12‑8 East and the still‑undrilled Mereenie Stairway formation, where timing is uncertain but potential upside is material.</p>\n<h2>Non-Cash Accounting Pressure</h2>\n<p>Higher non‑cash amortization also weighed on reported profit, masking the strength of operating performance. Management emphasized that cash margins and EBITDAX remain robust, suggesting that headline earnings understate the underlying health of the business during this investment phase.</p>\n<h2>Working Capital and JV Loan Complexity</h2>\n<p>A loan extended to a joint venture partner to facilitate the Thailand transaction added complexity to the balance sheet and near‑term cash outflows. The facility, which carries a floating rate and amortizes by end‑2027, has already seen more than $1 million repaid, but it remains a notable receivable and funding consideration.</p>\n<h2>Forward-Looking Guidance and Growth Pipeline</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Horizon plans to pay an FY‑26 interim dividend of AUD 0.015 per share in April 2026, supported by $35.6 million in cash and modest net debt. Operational priorities include ramp‑up of the Block 22/12 liquids upgrade, feasibility work on 12‑8 East, Maari optimization under its extended permit, Mereenie infill wells in late 2026 and major growth from Nam Phong’s booster compressor and Sinphuhorm tie‑ins.</p>\n<p>Horizon’s earnings call painted the picture of a company trading near‑term profit dilution for future growth and scale. Strong volumes, low operating costs and clear project catalysts in Thailand, Maari and Mereenie underpin a constructive outlook, while leverage and price volatility are the key risks investors will monitor as the next development phase unfolds.</p>",

Management framed 2025 as a year of stabilization and repositioning that could set up earnings upside, even as risks around litigation and re‑tenanting economics remain.</p>\n<h2>Solid Full-Year Results and Strong Cash Generation</h2>\n<p>Innovative Industrial reported 2025 total revenue of $266 million and AFFO of $205 million, underlining the cash-generating capacity of its portfolio despite tenant stress. Cash flow from operations reached roughly $200 million, and since inception the company has returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, highlighting a still shareholder-friendly capital allocation stance.</p>\n<h2>Quarterly AFFO Acceleration in Q4</h2>\n<p>In the fourth quarter, AFFO rose to $53.3 million, or $1.88 per share, a roughly 10% increase from $1.71 per share in Q3, on total revenue of $66.7 million. Management presented the quarter as evidence that re‑tenanting and collections are starting to flow through earnings, though some of the improvement was tied to one-off recoveries.</p>\n<h2>Leasing Wins and Re-Tenanting Progress</h2>\n<p>Leasing and re‑tenanting were a central theme, with new leases signed on four properties totaling about 339,000 square feet during 2025. The company also reported progress on leases and letters of intent covering over 900,000 square feet tied to previously nonperforming assets, including Forefront, Gold Flora and PharmaCann, signaling potential for future rent normalization.</p>\n<h2>Key Property-Level Leasing Highlights</h2>\n<p>Notable leasing wins included new agreements on 70,000 and 204,000 square feet in Palm Springs and Desert Hot Springs, respectively, showing traction in California assets. Management also highlighted a tentative deal for a 114,000-square-foot property in Washington, reinforcing the message that once-troubled sites are gradually being brought back into productive use.</p>\n<h2>Capital Deployment and IQHQ Strategic Investment</h2>\n<p>In 2025, Innovative Industrial committed roughly $275 million to new investments, underscoring continued growth ambitions even amid sector volatility. A major component was the strategic life‑science investment in IQHQ, where the company has funded $150 million of a $270 million commitment, leaving $120 million to be deployed over time as opportunities arise.</p>\n<h2>Liquidity Boost and Expanded Access to Capital</h2>\n<p>The company exited the quarter with total liquidity in excess of roughly $105 million to $107 million, combining cash and available revolvers. It also added a new $100 million revolving credit facility secured by the IQHQ investment at a 6.1% rate and has raised more than $145 million in debt and preferred equity since October 2025, bolstering its financial flexibility.</p>\n<h2>Preferred Equity Demand Signals Investor Appetite</h2>\n<p>Preferred equity markets have remained open, with about $5 million raised via at-the-market issuance in Q4 2025 and more than $40 million of preferred stock sold early in Q1 2026. The yield of just over 9.5% is not cheap capital, but the expansion of Series A preferred outstanding to $95 million of par value suggests continued investor confidence in the platform.</p>\n<h2>Balance Sheet Conservatism Remains a Core Asset</h2>\n<p>Management emphasized balance sheet strength, citing a portfolio of more than $2.5 billion in gross assets and over $2 billion in unencumbered real estate. Debt service coverage stands above 10 times and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is just 1.4 times, metrics that provide a cushion against sector volatility and upcoming maturities.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Pruning and Capital Recycling</h2>\n<p>The company continued to trim noncore holdings, closing three property sales in 2025 across California, Colorado and Michigan. Early in 2026 it also sold a dispensary in Phoenix, using the proceeds to recycle capital into higher-conviction opportunities and to streamline its footprint in challenged markets.</p>\n<h2>Legal Recovery Delivers Cash but Highlights Risk</h2>\n<p>On the legal front, Innovative Industrial secured a $7 million judgment against former tenant Temescal Wellness for unpaid rent and damages tied to a Massachusetts property. While this represents a clear recovery win and validates its enforcement approach, it also underscores ongoing tenant credit and legal risk embedded in the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Life-Science Tailwinds Support Diversification Strategy</h2>\n<p>Management pointed to improving fundamentals in life science real estate as a key pillar of its diversification thesis around IQHQ. The construction pipeline has shrunk from a 2023 peak exceeding 37 million square feet to about 6 million, while Boston annual demand has risen roughly 72%, and the San Francisco Peninsula logged its first Q4 vacancy decline in more than two years.</p>\n<h2>Troubled Tenants and Receiverships Still a Drag</h2>\n<p>Despite progress, the company remains entangled in receivership and legal processes with tenants such as Gold Flora and Forefront, as well as litigation involving PharmaCann. These situations have led to periods of deferred or unpaid rent, and management acknowledged that the legal and receivership mechanisms necessary to resolve them can significantly delay cash recovery.</p>\n<h2>One-Off Recoveries Inflate Near-Term AFFO</h2>\n<p>The better Q4 AFFO print was partly driven by $3.7 million, or about $0.13 per share, of payments from Gold Flora and an additional roughly $3 million, or $0.10 per share, recovered early in 2026. These one-time inflows, while welcome, mean some of the recent improvement is not yet indicative of a fully normalized recurring earnings run-rate.</p>\n<h2>Re-Leasing at Lower Rents Adds Pressure</h2>\n<p>Re‑leasing economics are not uniform across the portfolio, and management acknowledged that some new leases are being signed at rents as much as roughly 50% below prior contract levels. While filling space restores occupancy and cash flow, these resets indicate that certain local markets remain under pressure and could weigh on long-term yield profiles for affected assets.</p>\n<h2>Legal Costs and Regulatory Scrutiny Cloud Visibility</h2>\n<p>The company faces multiple ongoing legal matters, including tenant disputes, receiverships and issues referenced in its annual filing that involve financial regulators. Management noted that it has not yet recorded a legal reserve and that legal expenses, which historically average around $2 million annually, remain difficult to forecast, adding another layer of earnings uncertainty.</p>\n<h2>Refinancing and Maturity Overhang</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, an upcoming bond maturity at the end of May 2026 looms as a key capital markets test despite the strong base of unencumbered assets. Management did not provide a definitive refinancing plan on the call, leaving investors focused on the timing, cost and structure of whatever solution the company ultimately chooses.</p>\n<h2>Higher Funding Costs Shape Capital Strategy</h2>\n<p>The cost of new capital is clearly higher than in past cycles, with preferred equity issued at just over 9.5% and the IQHQ-secured revolver priced at 6.1%. While these facilities expand liquidity and support growth, they also raise the company’s overall financing expense and heighten the importance of deploying capital into high-return opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Regulatory Uncertainty in Cannabis and Hemp</h2>\n<p>Management noted that the recent executive order to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III is directionally supportive for operators and landlords but remains uncertain in timing and impact. Potential changes to intoxicating hemp rules expected in late 2026 add another layer of market ambiguity, which could influence tenant credit and transaction activity in the near term.</p>\n<h2>Remaining IQHQ Funding Commitment</h2>\n<p>The company still has $120 million, or roughly 44.4%, left to fund on its $270 million IQHQ commitment, a sizable obligation that will require incremental capital over time. While management views this exposure as a strategic foothold in life science real estate, investors will be watching how the remaining funding is paced and financed amid a higher-rate environment.</p>\n<h2>Guidance and Outlook Emphasize Re-Leasing Upside</h2>\n<p>For 2026, management framed guidance around opportunistic capital market access and unlocking earnings from re‑tenanting more than 900,000 square feet of space currently under leases or LOIs. With liquidity above $105 million, a new $100 million revolver, conservative leverage metrics and a shrinking life-science construction pipeline, the company believes it is well positioned to support its dividend and capture incremental revenue as leasing and capital deployment continue.</p>\n<p>Innovative Industrial’s call painted a picture of a platform that is stabilizing and retooling, with AFFO growth, leasing progress and strong balance sheet metrics offset by ongoing tenant, legal and refinancing uncertainties. For investors, the story now hinges on how quickly re‑tenanting converts into recurring cash flow, how expensive upcoming refinancing proves to be and whether legal outcomes break in the company’s favor.</p>",

The overall message was one of disciplined capital management and confidence that free cash flow and shareholder returns will improve as integration progresses.</p>\n<h2>Record 2025 performance underscores cash engine</h2>\n<p>SM Energy reported record operating cash flow, adjusted EBITDAX, total production, and oil volumes for 2025, with oil making up 53% of output, underscoring the strength of its liquids‑weighted portfolio. The company returned $104 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, signaling that its cash generation is already translating into tangible capital returns.</p>\n<h2>Deleveraging accelerates toward target range</h2>\n<p>The company reduced net debt by $437 million in 2025, ending the year at roughly 1x leverage before the Civitas transaction. On a pro forma basis leverage is now in the mid‑1s, but management reiterated a goal to move toward the low‑1s, using rising free cash flow to further de‑risk the balance sheet.</p>\n<h2>Civitas merger synergies already largely captured</h2>\n<p>Management emphasized that $185 million of the $200–$300 million Civitas synergy target has already been actioned, translating to roughly $1 billion in present value based on their characterization. They see total potential synergies unlocking as much as $1.5 billion in present value, making the combination a key driver of value creation over the next several years.</p>\n<h2>Liquidity bolstered by revolver capacity and asset sale</h2>\n<p>SM’s borrowing base was lifted to $5 billion with lender commitments of $2.5 billion, leaving the company with nearly $3 billion of available liquidity. In addition, SM announced the sale of select South Texas assets for $950 million, expected to close in the second quarter, which should further fortify liquidity and support continued debt paydown.</p>\n<h2>Capital plan pivots to free cash flow over growth</h2>\n<p>For 2026, SM set a capital budget of $2.65–$2.85 billion, about 14% below pro forma 2025 spending, under a $60 oil and $3.50 gas price deck. Activity will be reset to an average of 11 rigs next year, down from a pro forma 14, reflecting a shift away from pure volume growth and toward maximizing sustainable free cash flow.</p>\n<h2>Return-of-capital framework and higher dividend</h2>\n<p>The board approved a 10% increase in the fixed annual dividend to $0.88 per share, giving the stock a current yield just under 4% based on management commentary. Free cash flow after dividends will be directed 80% to debt reduction and 20% to share repurchases initially, with management signaling an intention to tilt more toward buybacks as leverage moves lower.</p>\n<h2>Production outlook sets new baseline run rate</h2>\n<p>Management guided second‑half 2026 production to between 420,000 and 430,000 BOE per day, with oil accounting for around 55% of volumes. They characterized that H2 level as the indicative go‑forward run rate for the combined company, implying a more stable, oil‑weighted production profile once the transition phase passes.</p>\n<h2>Credit upgrades support liability management</h2>\n<p>SM has received rating upgrades from both S&amp;P and Fitch, reflecting the improved scale and balance sheet after the merger and deleveraging. The company plans to use its robust liquidity to address near‑term bond maturities, including 2026 obligations and a $417 million note due in 2027, and will look to term out debt further as markets allow.</p>\n<h2>Front-loaded 2026 CapEx creates near-term noise</h2>\n<p>The 2026 spending program is heavily front‑loaded, with higher capital outlays in the first quarter due to entering the year with roughly 15 rigs before stepping down to about 11. This cadence will pressure early‑year cash flow and create a lumpy production profile, with investors encouraged to focus on the cleaner second‑half run rate rather than quarterly volatility.</p>\n<h2>Legacy Civitas declines weigh on early-year volumes</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted that inherited Civitas assets experienced an approximate 14% production decline from September into January, adding to the softness in early‑2026 volumes. These declines, combined with timing effects from the integration, will complicate quarter‑to‑quarter comparisons as the combined asset base stabilizes.</p>\n<h2>Reporting changes muddy production comparisons</h2>\n<p>A shift in reporting from 3‑stream to 2‑stream in some areas is also distorting year‑over‑year volume comparisons, with about 20% of DJ basin BOEs and roughly 5% of Permian BOEs now being classified as NGLs. These changes create modeling complexity and temporary reported volume shifts, even though underlying resource recovery has not changed.</p>\n<h2>Leverage and inventory depth in investor focus</h2>\n<p>Despite deleveraging progress, pro forma leverage remains in the mid‑1s and the company estimates about an eight‑year inventory life, which is shorter than some shale peers. Management aims to offset these concerns through rapid debt reduction and continued portfolio optimization, but investors may remain sensitive to any downturn in commodities or capital markets.</p>\n<h2>Plan tied closely to commodity price deck</h2>\n<p>The company’s 2026 free‑cash‑flow story is built on $60 oil and $3.50 gas assumptions, making outcomes sensitive to macro conditions. If prices fall materially below that deck, SM acknowledges that free cash flow, deleveraging pace, and the capacity to meet its return‑of‑capital targets would all come under pressure.</p>\n<h2>Integration progress good, but execution risk remains</h2>\n<p>SM is only about four weeks into fully combined operations with Civitas, and while most of the synergy target is already identified, execution is still a key risk. Successfully integrating systems and optimizing development across the enlarged footprint will determine whether the upper end of the $1.5 billion synergy value can be realized.</p>\n<h2>Guidance points to leaner, cash-focused 2026</h2>\n<p>For 2026, SM plans $2.65–$2.85 billion of CapEx, about 14% below pro forma 2025, with roughly 45% directed to the Permian and about 45% of total spending in the second half. The strategy uses a $60 oil and $3.50 gas case, targets H2 volumes of 420,000–430,000 BOE per day at 55% oil, directs 80% of post‑dividend free cash flow to debt and 20% to buybacks, and is backed by nearly $3 billion of liquidity plus a $950 million asset sale.</p>\n<p>SM Energy’s call painted a picture of a newly scaled company leaning hard into balance‑sheet strength, disciplined capital, and growing shareholder returns, even as it navigates early‑year volatility and integration risk. For investors, the key watchpoints will be commodity prices, the pace of deleveraging, and the company’s ability to deliver on its synergy and free‑cash‑flow promises while maintaining its new production base.</p>",

The company has requested a waiver of the fine, arguing that as a government enterprise, director appointments rest with the President of India and that it has been regularly apprising the Ministry of Coal about the need for additional independent directors, asserting the lapse was beyond management’s control.</p>\n<p>The case underscores ongoing governance and compliance challenges for government-owned listed entities, where regulatory obligations can clash with slower state-controlled appointment processes, potentially leading to recurring disclosure and penalty issues. Investors and other stakeholders will be watching how regulators and the company resolve the waiver request, as the outcome may set a precedent for how similar governance lapses at other public-sector companies are treated in future.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about NLC India Limited</u></b></p>\n<p>NLC India Limited is a Government of India ‘Navratna’ enterprise operating under the Ministry of Coal, engaged in mining and power generation.
