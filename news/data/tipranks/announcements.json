The latest step was the closing of an Australian secondary offering of 15.2 million CHESS Depositary Interests at A$10.35 each, for A$157 million, sold by Greenstone Resources II L.P. and other existing shareholders.</p>\n<p>While Marimaca did not receive any proceeds from the Australian secondary tranche, the broader global offering included a Canadian treasury component that strengthened the company’s balance sheet. The deal significantly reduced cornerstone investor Greenstone’s stake from 18.58% to 6.44%, improving free float and potentially enhancing trading liquidity, with selling shareholders now subject to a 90-day lock-up that may help stabilize the stock in the near term.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"TSE:MARI\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:mari\">(TSE:MARI)</a> stock is a Hold with a C$12.50 price target.

Technicals are supportive due to a clear uptrend, but overbought signals reduce confidence. Valuation is also constrained by negative earnings (negative P/E) and no provided dividend yield.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on TSE:MARI stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:mari/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Marimaca Copper</u></b></p>\n<p>Marimaca Copper Corp. is a copper-focused mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange.

Net tangible assets per share deteriorated further into negative territory, and the company signalled that its forthcoming audited financial statements may include a material uncertainty related to going concern, underscoring ongoing financial pressure and potential risks for shareholders and creditors.</p>\n<p>The preliminary report shows no changes in control over subsidiaries, no associates or joint ventures, and continued reliance on Australian Accounting Standards for any foreign operations, pointing to operational stability but limited growth. The absence of dividends for both the current and prior periods, combined with widening losses and negative net tangible assets, highlights that NoviqTech remains in a challenging financial position, with its long-term viability likely to come under close scrutiny when the audited accounts are released in March 2026.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Tymlez Group Ltd.</u></b></p>\n<p>NoviqTech Limited is an Australian-listed company that prepares its financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards, including for any foreign entities in its consolidated group.

The Bambach Wires and Cables unit narrowed its loss slightly, while the board completed a review of strategic opportunities and refreshed leadership, and the company shored up working capital by raising $3.78 million in loans, converting $1.55 million of borrowings to equity and repaying $0.4 million in debt, underscoring continued financial pressure but some balance sheet repair and strategic repositioning.</p>\n<p>No interim or final dividend was declared for the period, reflecting the company’s continued losses and focus on capital management. The appointment of Doron Eldar to help guide the business as it returns to core activities, together with the conversion of debt to equity, suggests efforts to stabilise operations and position the group for future growth despite weak current trading conditions.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:EGY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:egy\">(AU:EGY)</a> stock is a Sell with a A$0.02 price target.

The company did not declare or pay any dividends for the period, indicating a continued focus on conserving capital for operations and development activities rather than returning cash to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Despite the swing to loss, Racura’s net tangible assets per share improved to 11.71 cents from 10.39 cents, suggesting the balance sheet asset backing per security has strengthened. The absence of changes in control over entities and the lack of a dividend reinvestment plan point to a relatively stable corporate structure, with stakeholders’ attention likely to remain on how management steers the business back toward profitability while sustaining asset value.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:RAC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:rac\">(AU:RAC)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$2.00 price target.

The study underpins an initial 11-year mine life, with higher-intensity mining in the first two years to access higher-grade ore and build stockpiles that support later production.</p>\n<p>The DFS points to strong project economics, including high pre-tax NPVs, internal rates of return, and rapid payback periods under both spot and consensus silver price cases. With an all-in sustaining cost of A$39.70 per ounce and a relatively modest A$260 million peak funding requirement, the project is positioned as a high-margin, finance-ready development featuring sizable low-grade stockpiles that bolster downside protection and lender confidence.</p>\n<p>The ore reserves and mineral resources that support the production target have been prepared under the JORC Code by independent Competent Persons, reinforcing the technical foundations of the project. Paris also offers leverage to higher silver prices and sits within a 15-kilometre mineralised corridor, giving the company district-scale growth options via potential satellite deposits near the planned processing plant and tailings storage facility.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:IVR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:ivr\">(AU:IVR)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$0.12 price target.
