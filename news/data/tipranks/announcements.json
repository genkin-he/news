The patent, which runs through 2039, protects a polymerizable rhCollagen- and hyaluronic acid-based formulation that is injected into sub-epidermal tissue and then light-activated in situ to form a supportive scaffold for structural tissue restoration and long-term contour stability.</p>\n<p>Management described the allowance as a strategic milestone in expanding clinical and commercial uses of its rhCollagen platform in high-value aesthetic markets, highlighting South Korea as one of the company’s largest target territories. The Korean allowance builds on recent Japanese patent protection and complements existing patents in the United States, Europe, China, Brazil, Australia and Israel, strengthening CollPlant’s global IP position as it develops products aimed at a global injectable soft-tissue filler market estimated at more than $6 billion.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CLGN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/clgn\">(CLGN)</a> stock is a Sell with a $2.00 price target.

Technicals provide partial support with a stronger short-term trend, but longer-term trend and momentum are mixed.
