Executives stressed tighter capital discipline, operational fixes and quality initiatives as the levers to unlock what they see as substantial embedded earnings power.</p>\n<h2>Revenue Growth and Earnings Beat</h2>\n<p>Acadia reported fourth‑quarter revenue of $821.5 million, a 6.1% increase from a year earlier that reflected stronger volumes across its behavioral health facilities. Full‑year 2025 revenue reached $3.31 billion, rising 5% and landing slightly above the high end of prior guidance, signaling that demand remains resilient despite regulatory and operational challenges.</p>\n<h2>Adjusted EBITDA Near Top of Range</h2>\n<p>Profitability tracked close to expectations, with fourth‑quarter adjusted EBITDA coming in at $99.8 million. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $608.9 million, essentially at the upper end of the company’s $601 million to $611 million guidance range and suggesting that cost controls and mix helped offset some of the external pressures.</p>\n<h2>Same‑Facility Performance Improves</h2>\n<p>Underpinning results was better performance at existing hospitals, where fourth‑quarter same‑facility revenue grew 4.4% year over year. That improvement was driven by a 1.3% increase in revenue per patient day and a 3.1% rise in patient days, supporting same‑facility adjusted EBITDA of $152 million in the quarter and indicating healthier utilization trends.</p>\n<h2>Significant Capacity Expansion Strategy</h2>\n<p>Acadia continued to lean into growth, adding 1,089 beds in 2025, above the high end of its target and including 778 beds from six new facilities. The company has opened more than 2,500 beds over the past three years and, despite recent closures, still expects to bring on another 400 to 600 beds in 2026, positioning the network for long‑term volume gains.</p>\n<h2>Embedded EBITDA From New Facilities</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted what it views as a large earnings opportunity embedded in recently opened hospitals, estimating more than $200 million of incremental EBITDA potential from facilities launched between 2023 and 2026. The company expects that upside to be realized over roughly five years as occupancy ramps and operations mature, although the pace will depend on execution and local market dynamics.</p>\n<h2>CapEx Discipline and Free Cash Flow Turn</h2>\n<p>Capital spending came in lighter than planned, with 2025 CapEx of $572 million coming in nearly $50 million below prior guidance. For 2026, the company plans to cut CapEx sharply to a range of $255 million to $280 million and, with growth spend moderating, now expects to generate positive free cash flow for the year, a key milestone for investors focused on leverage and liquidity.</p>\n<h2>Lower Investigation Costs and Solid Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Costs tied to the ongoing government investigation fell steeply to $12 million in the fourth quarter, down 69% sequentially, easing one source of earnings drag. Liquidity remains ample, with $133.2 million of cash on hand at year‑end and roughly $595 million available under a $1 billion revolving credit facility, leaving net leverage at about four times adjusted EBITDA.</p>\n<h2>Operational and Quality Overhaul</h2>\n<p>The returning chief executive laid out a renewed focus on operational discipline, deepening the leadership bench and standardizing the playbook for new hospital openings. Acadia is also rolling out expanded quality dashboards tracking more than 50 measures and publishing early outcomes data, aiming to tighten performance management and strengthen its position with regulators and payers.</p>\n<h2>PLGL Reserve and Expense Headwinds</h2>\n<p>Results were weighed down by a $52.7 million fourth‑quarter adjustment to the professional and general liability reserve, reflecting higher anticipated claims costs. Looking ahead, PLGL expense is expected to run between $100 million and $110 million in 2026, representing a meaningful ongoing drag on profitability and cash generation until trends stabilize.</p>\n<h2>New York Medicaid Policy Impact</h2>\n<p>A policy shift in New York that bars out‑of‑state Medicaid patients will hit Acadia’s bottom line and footprint. Management estimates the change will reduce annual EBITDA by $25 million to $30 million in 2026 and has already prompted consolidations and closures in the affected markets as the company reshapes its network to reflect the new rules.</p>\n<h2>Start‑Up Losses and Slower Ramps</h2>\n<p>Aggressive expansion has brought sizeable start‑up losses, which totaled $12.8 million in the fourth quarter and $56 million for 2025. For 2026, the company expects start‑up losses of $47 million to $53 million, with some newer facilities ramping more slowly than anticipated and delaying the timing of expected EBITDA contributions.</p>\n<h2>Facility Closures and Associated Costs</h2>\n<p>In 2025, Acadia closed five facilities totaling 382 beds, including two leased sites shuttered in response to the New York policy change. The company recorded $3.6 million in net operating costs linked to these closures, underlining the near‑term financial impact of portfolio pruning even as management argues it will sharpen focus on higher‑return assets.</p>\n<h2>Legal and Regulatory Overhang</h2>\n<p>Despite the reduction in investigation‑related expenses, the company still faces unresolved legal and regulatory matters that could require future cash settlements. Management acknowledged that both the timing and the ultimate size of any resolution remain uncertain, leaving a cloud over the otherwise improving financial trajectory.</p>\n<h2>Leverage Constraints on Flexibility</h2>\n<p>With net leverage standing at roughly four times adjusted EBITDA at year‑end, Acadia is operating with limited balance‑sheet flexibility until free cash flow improves. Management signaled that paying down debt and addressing outstanding liabilities will be key priorities before contemplating more aggressive strategic moves or shareholder returns.</p>\n<h2>Near‑Term Headwinds to Early 2026</h2>\n<p>Guidance for the first quarter of 2026 builds in several temporary drags, including about $3.7 million in severe‑weather impact and roughly $14 million of start‑up losses. The outlook for Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $130 million to $137 million also assumes recognition of $11 million in out‑of‑period supplemental payments, complicating year‑over‑year comparisons for investors.</p>\n<h2>One‑Time Revenue Items Fade</h2>\n<p>Full‑year 2025 revenue benefited from a nonrecurring $34 million boost tied to supplemental payments from Tennessee, giving a one‑time lift to the top line and margins. With no similar items embedded in 2026 guidance, reported growth rates may appear more muted, even as underlying operations continue to improve.</p>\n<h2>Guidance and Forward‑Looking Outlook</h2>\n<p>For 2026, Acadia is targeting revenue between $3.37 billion and $3.45 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $575 million to $610 million and adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.55, while turning free cash flow positive. The outlook assumes modest same‑facility volume growth, higher revenue per patient day, substantial start‑up losses, elevated PLGL expense and a potential $22 million EBITDA uplift if pending programs are approved, with first‑quarter guidance calling for revenue of $820 million to $830 million.</p>\n<p>Acadia’s earnings call painted a picture of a company balancing solid demand and a sizable growth runway with tangible financial and regulatory headwinds. Investors will be watching whether the push for operational discipline, capital spending restraint and quality improvements can convert the embedded EBITDA opportunity into cash flow, reduce leverage and gradually lift the overhang from investigations and policy shocks.</p>",

Strong volume growth, successful integration of the Thailand assets and robust cash generation offset the drag from weaker oil prices and higher amortization, reinforcing the narrative of a business building scale with manageable balance-sheet risk.</p>\n<h2>Strong Volume Growth</h2>\n<p>Production and sales volumes rose sharply, up 26% and 25% versus the prior half, pushing output above 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. This volume expansion reflects both organic performance and the first meaningful contribution from the newly acquired Thailand assets, setting a higher operational base for the group.</p>\n<h2>Resilient Revenue and Earnings Metrics</h2>\n<p>Underlying revenue for the half reached $54.2 million, including $9.6 million from Thailand, while EBITDAX came in at $28.6 million, broadly flat on the prior half. That stability is notable given a 15% decline in realized oil price, indicating tight cost control and diversification benefits from gas-weighted assets.</p>\n<h2>Material Improvement in Operating Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>Cash flow from operating activities jumped 37% to $25.1 million, underlining the cash-generative nature of the portfolio despite softer prices. This was sufficient to fund the FY’25 final dividend of $15.9 million, reduce debt by $3 million and support $4.6 million of sustaining and development spend without stressing liquidity.</p>\n<h2>Thailand Acquisition: Immediate Scale and Low Costs</h2>\n<p>The Thailand acquisition, completed on 1 August 2025, delivered roughly 28% of group production over just five months and $9.6 million of revenue. These assets are particularly attractive given operating costs of about $7 per barrel of oil equivalent and early optimization at Nam Phong already delivering around a 7% production uplift.</p>\n<h2>Major Development Upside in Thailand</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted the final investment decision on the Nam Phong Booster Compressor as a key growth lever. Once online from mid‑2026, the project is expected to boost Nam Phong field production by at least 40%, providing material near‑term upside and further leveraging the low‑cost Thailand position.</p>\n<h2>Maari Permit Extension and Production Recovery</h2>\n<p>At Maari, a 10‑year permit extension to December 2037 significantly extends field life and underpins investment. Operationally, Maari delivered its strongest daily production in more than five years, with average half‑year output about 12% higher than the comparable period, signaling a meaningful recovery.</p>\n<h2>Mereenie Performance and Gas Sales Progress</h2>\n<p>Mereenie also performed well, with two recent infill wells contributing roughly a quarter of the field’s gas production. Improved realized gas pricing and a binding letter of intent with Power and Water Corporation create a pathway for firm gas sales through 2034, supporting plans for further infill drilling in 2026.</p>\n<h2>Low Cash Operating Costs and Balance Sheet Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Group cash operating costs remain around $20 per barrel of oil equivalent, positioning the company competitively through cycles. With cash of $35.6 million at 31 December 2025 and modest net debt of $9.8 million, Horizon is able to maintain an interim dividend of AUD 0.015 per share while funding development and working capital.</p>\n<h2>Record Calendar-Year Context</h2>\n<p>For calendar 2025, sales volumes were the highest in five years, underscoring the step‑change delivered by Thailand. Underlying revenue of $103.6 million and EBITDAX of $54 million highlight the consistency of earnings capacity even as the portfolio evolves, providing a solid platform for future growth projects.</p>\n<h2>Lower Realized Oil Price Impact</h2>\n<p>The main drag on reported results was a 15% fall in realized oil prices, which weighed on profitability. Calendar 2025 profit was limited to $8 million, reflecting not only the weaker price environment but also higher non‑cash amortization that compressed accounting earnings despite firm margins.</p>\n<h2>Acquisition Funding and Increased Leverage</h2>\n<p>The Thailand deal was largely funded with debt, and together with the FY’25 final dividend and a loan to a joint venture partner, it drove a reduction in cash and a shift to net debt of $9.8 million. Management framed this leverage as modest and manageable relative to cash flow, but investors will watch balance‑sheet discipline closely.</p>\n<h2>Operational Interruptions at Sinphuhorm</h2>\n<p>Not all assets ran at full tilt, with Sinphuhorm’s output temporarily constrained in August and September by planned maintenance at the EGAT power station. Management also flagged similar seasonal effects in February and March, though these interruptions are short‑term and primarily defer rather than destroy value.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing Projects Not Yet Realized</h2>\n<p>Several initiatives remain in execution or review, meaning their benefits are not yet in the numbers. These include the Block 22/12 liquids‑handling upgrade, evaluation of a multi‑well development at 12‑8 East and the still‑undrilled Mereenie Stairway formation, where timing is uncertain but potential upside is material.</p>\n<h2>Non-Cash Accounting Pressure</h2>\n<p>Higher non‑cash amortization also weighed on reported profit, masking the strength of operating performance. Management emphasized that cash margins and EBITDAX remain robust, suggesting that headline earnings understate the underlying health of the business during this investment phase.</p>\n<h2>Working Capital and JV Loan Complexity</h2>\n<p>A loan extended to a joint venture partner to facilitate the Thailand transaction added complexity to the balance sheet and near‑term cash outflows. The facility, which carries a floating rate and amortizes by end‑2027, has already seen more than $1 million repaid, but it remains a notable receivable and funding consideration.</p>\n<h2>Forward-Looking Guidance and Growth Pipeline</h2>\n<p>Looking ahead, Horizon plans to pay an FY‑26 interim dividend of AUD 0.015 per share in April 2026, supported by $35.6 million in cash and modest net debt. Operational priorities include ramp‑up of the Block 22/12 liquids upgrade, feasibility work on 12‑8 East, Maari optimization under its extended permit, Mereenie infill wells in late 2026 and major growth from Nam Phong’s booster compressor and Sinphuhorm tie‑ins.</p>\n<p>Horizon’s earnings call painted the picture of a company trading near‑term profit dilution for future growth and scale. Strong volumes, low operating costs and clear project catalysts in Thailand, Maari and Mereenie underpin a constructive outlook, while leverage and price volatility are the key risks investors will monitor as the next development phase unfolds.</p>",
