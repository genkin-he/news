Discovery entity holding the company’s Streaming &amp; Studios businesses, leaving WBD’s Global Linear Networks and certain other assets separated.

Discovery notified Netflix that a revised offer from Paramount Skydance Corporation constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement. Netflix waived its right to negotiate changes, and on February 27, 2026, WBD terminated the deal with Netflix to sign a merger agreement with Paramount Skydance, triggering a $2.8 billion termination fee payable to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement on February 27, 2026, all related financing commitments arranged by Netflix, including a bridge commitment letter, incremental bridge facility, a 2025 revolving credit facility and a delayed draw term loan, were automatically canceled.

The move increases the company’s drawing capacity to €1.35 million as of February 26, 2026, extends its cash runway by about four months, and is framed by management as a vote of confidence in its strategy and late-stage clinical programs in obesity and sarcopenia.</p>\n<p>Under the revised terms, each bond bears 12% interest and is redeemable in cash on a bi-monthly schedule over 24 months, while in a default scenario the debt could be repaid in shares at a fixed premium price, implying potential but limited dilution for existing shareholders. Backing from Hexagon Capital Fund, which specializes in financing European SMEs via bonds and equities, underscores continued institutional support for Biophytis at a capital-intensive stage of development, giving the biotech added financial flexibility to advance its pipeline in high unmet-need indications.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"BPTSY\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bptsy\">(BPTSY)</a> stock is a Hold with a $0.65 price target.
