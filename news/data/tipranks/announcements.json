(AMGN) is preparing a new Phase 2b trial called “Phase 2b Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of Maridebart Cafraglutide in Adult Participants Living With Elevated Liver Fat and Obesity or Overweight.” The study aims to see if its drug can lower liver fat and body weight in adults with obesity or overweight, a growing health issue that has clear long-term cost and care implications.</p>\n<p>The trial will test maridebart cafraglutide, also known as AMG 133, given as a shot under the skin. The goal is to see whether this treatment, used with diet and exercise, can deliver better liver fat reduction and weight loss than a dummy shot.</p>\n<p>This is an interventional study where people are randomly assigned to receive either the active drug or placebo. Neither patients nor their doctors will know who is getting which treatment, and the main goal is to measure how well the drug works as a treatment while watching safety.</p>\n<p>The record shows the study was first submitted on February 6, 2026, signaling Amgen’s move to push this asset into mid-stage development. The latest update was filed on February 26, 2026, suggesting planning and setup are active even though recruitment has not yet started.</p>\n<p>For investors, this update underlines Amgen’s push into obesity and liver disease, areas where peers working on GLP-1 and related drugs have driven sharp stock gains and sector re-rating. If maridebart cafraglutide shows solid weight loss and liver benefits over time, it could support Amgen’s long-term growth story and sentiment, though near-term stock impact will likely be modest until early data arrive.</p>\n<p>The trial is not yet recruiting but is actively updated, and further details are available on the ClinicalTrials portal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To learn more about <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amgn\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMGN</a></span>’s potential, visit the <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amgn/drug-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amgen Inc</a></span> drug pipeline page.</p>",

(RGNX) is running a late stage study of RGX-121, a gene therapy for children with neuronopathic MPS II, also known as Hunter Syndrome. The Phase 3 trial aims to see if a single treatment can improve symptoms, slow disease progression in the brain, and offer a longer term alternative to current supportive care.</p>\n<p>The treatment being tested is RGX-121-3102, a genetic medicine delivered by an AAV9 viral vector. It is designed to provide a working copy of the IDS gene directly to the central nervous system so patients can produce the missing enzyme instead of relying on repeated infusions.</p>\n<p>The study uses a single group, open label design, so every child enrolled receives RGX-121 at a dose set per brain mass. There is no placebo arm, and the main focus is treatment benefit, with researchers tracking safety, clinical outcomes, and how the body responds to different dose levels.</p>\n<p>The trial is listed as Phase 3 and interventional, but its status is currently suspended, meaning new activity is on hold for now. The record was last updated on February 25, 2026, which matters because it shows regulators and the company are actively maintaining the listing and signals recent changes that investors should note.</p>\n<p>This update is important for RGNX because RGX-121 targets a rare disease where even modest progress can support premium pricing and potential partnerships. A suspended status, however, can pressure the stock in the short term, raise questions on safety, design, or strategy, and may benefit competing gene therapy players working on lysosomal storage disorders.</p>\n<p>Investors will watch closely for clarity on the reason for the suspension, any regulatory feedback, and updated timelines, as a return to active status could restore confidence. Until then, sentiment around RGNX may stay cautious, with valuation more tied to the broader gene therapy pipeline and sector risk appetite than to this single program.</p>\n<p>The RGX-121 Phase 3 study remains listed as an active record with a recent update, and more information is available on the ClinicalTrials portal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To learn more about <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rgnx\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">RGNX</a></span>’s potential, visit the <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rgnx/drug-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">RegenXBio Inc.</a></span> drug pipeline page.</p>",
