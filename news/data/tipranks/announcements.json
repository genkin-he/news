Overall growth was tempered by Medicare coverage changes for DecisionDx-SCC and the May 2025 discontinuation of IDgenetix, contributing to a shift from 2024 net income to a 2025 net loss of $24.2 million, even as the company generated $64.3 million in operating cash flow and ended the year with $299.5 million in cash and investments.</p>\n<p>Fourth-quarter 2025 revenue rose 1% to $87.0 million, with core test volumes up 42%, but the company moved from prior-year quarterly profit to a small net loss as Adjusted EBITDA declined to $11.5 million. During late 2025, Castle bolstered its clinical and market positioning with new consensus and clinical data supporting DecisionDx-Melanoma, a meta-analysis validating TissueCypher’s risk-stratification performance, and the limited access launch of AdvanceAD-Tx, while guiding for 2026 revenue in the $340–350 million range, signaling continued focus on high-growth, high-evidence franchises despite reimbursement headwinds and portfolio pruning.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CSTL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cstl\">(CSTL)</a> stock is a Buy with a $50.00 price target.

His expertise in lithium, niobium, tantalum, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements and gold, along with his role in advancing HMS Bergbau’s integrated critical-minerals projects in Kazakhstan, is expected to deepen strategic alignment between the two companies while supporting Belmont’s governance and technical capabilities.</p>\n<p>The company also granted 4.3 million incentive stock options to directors, officers, advisors and consultants, exercisable at CAD$0.05 per share for five years under its stock option plan and TSX Venture Exchange policies. The options issuance underscores Belmont’s use of equity-based incentives to retain and motivate key personnel as it advances its portfolio of uranium, copper, gold, lithium and critical metals projects in North America.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"TSE:BEA\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:bea\">(TSE:BEA)</a> stock is a Hold with a C$0.04 price target.

Despite these pressures, the company cited its GRO AHT cost and revenue initiatives as driving more than $40 million of EBITDA improvement in 2025, including 2.4% growth in comparable Hotel EBITDA and over $13 million in corporate G&amp;A savings, though it nonetheless posted a 2025 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $215 million and negative AFFO.</p>\n<p>Management detailed an aggressive capital-structure and portfolio streamlining program, noting the payoff of remaining corporate-level debt in early 2025 and the completed sale of six hotels for about $145 million, plus agreements to sell three additional properties expected to generate significant capex savings and improve cash flow after debt service. The company also disclosed a maturity default on its $325 million JPM8 mortgage loan secured by eight hotels, while emphasizing that dispositions and potential handing back of assets could improve leverage and future capital needs, and reiterated that a special committee formed in early December 2025 is evaluating strategic alternatives to address the gap between the portfolio’s perceived value and the market price of its common stock.</p>\n<p>Operationally, Ashford reported that comparable hotel RevPAR fell 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2025 year-over-year, largely due to a federal government shutdown that began in October and drove a 27.9% decline in government-related room nights, with outsized impact on its Washington, D.C. exposure. Excluding the D.C. market, comparable RevPAR was flat and total revenue increased slightly, underscoring the company’s view that its ongoing asset sales, debt extensions, and performance initiatives are creating a leaner, more resilient portfolio despite constrained liquidity and continued industry uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AHT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht\">(AHT)</a> stock is a Hold with a $4.00 price target.
