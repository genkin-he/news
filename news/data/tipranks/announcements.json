The amendment raises the allowable leverage covenant to 5.0x through the fourth quarter of 2026 and to 4.75x through the second quarter of 2027, before reverting to 4.25x thereafter, while also adding a higher pricing tier for elevated leverage, capping annual share repurchases at $65 million, and tightening restrictions on acquisitions and investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries during the specified period ending after third-quarter 2027 reporting.</p>\n<p>These covenant changes are designed to give Graphic Packaging room to manage its balance sheet and operations without breaching its loan terms as it works through lower inventory levels and associated earnings pressure. The added limits on shareholder returns and expansionary moves signal a more cautious capital allocation framework during this period, affecting lenders, investors, and potential acquisition targets as the company navigates its leverage profile under the revised agreement.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"GPK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gpk\">(GPK)</a> stock is a Buy with a $22.00 price target.

These are partly offset by attractive valuation (low P/E and solid dividend yield) and earnings-call guidance pointing to a 2026 free-cash-flow improvement driven by lower capex and inventory reduction, albeit with notable near-term demand and pricing headwinds.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on GPK stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gpk/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Graphic Packaging</u></b></p>\n<p>Graphic Packaging Holding Company operates in the packaging industry through its primary operating subsidiary, Graphic Packaging International, LLC, and related entities.
