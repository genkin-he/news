The additional stock, issued on 24 February 2026, marginally increases AMP’s share capital base and reflects the ongoing use of equity-based instruments within its capital management and employee or incentive structures.</p>\n<p>While the size of this issuance is relatively modest compared with AMP’s overall register, it still constitutes incremental dilution for existing shareholders and signals continued reliance on unquoted options or convertible securities in its remuneration and financing mix. The move underscores standard capital markets practice for large financial institutions, with limited immediate operational impact but some implications for ownership dispersion and future earnings per share.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:AMP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:amp\">(AU:AMP)</a> stock is a Sell with a A$1.50 price target.

The bank’s two-pillar model, combining interest income with a growing investment and pension business, continued to underpin earnings quality and regional value creation while supporting an unchanged dividend of CHF 47.50 per participation certificate.</p>\n<p>Operating income declined by 2.9% mainly due to higher risk provisions, even as net interest income before provisions rose 1.3% and commission and service income gained 1.9% on stronger markets and new investment volumes. Operating expenses increased 4.1% as GKB invested in digitalisation and holistic advisory services, but productivity remained high with a cost/income ratio of 48.0%, underscoring the bank’s focus on efficiency alongside strategic spending.</p>\n<p>The balance sheet expanded with business volume up 3.5% to CHF 78.8 billion and customer loans rising 1.5%, driven largely by mortgage and traditional lending to private and SME clients in the home market. Client assets under management grew 4.5%, though outflows from some larger institutional clients led to net new money of minus CHF 0.7 billion, partly offset by solid inflows of CHF 0.3 billion from private and corporate customers.</p>\n<p>GKB’s capitalisation remains a key strength, with eligible equity of CHF 2.8 billion and a high risk-weighted capital ratio of 20.0%, reflecting a strategy oriented towards crisis resilience and stability. The bank’s profit distribution will see CHF 118.8 million flow to the Canton of Graubünden and participation certificate holders, including CHF 103.6 million to the canton when state guarantee compensation is factored in, highlighting its fiscal importance for the region.</p>\n<p>A new study by BAK Economics and the University of Applied Sciences of Graubünden confirms GKB’s broader economic role, estimating annual value creation of CHF 415 million through direct and indirect effects. Management emphasised that the bank’s influence extends beyond pure banking, as it supports companies, strengthens regional development and assumes social responsibility within Graubünden.</p>\n<p>Under the 2026–2030 strategy shaped by new chairman Heinz Huber, GKB plans to build on its established model while adapting to technological and societal shifts, prioritising first-class advisory services, further income diversification and continued operational stability. In a still-challenging low interest rate environment but with supportive equity markets, the bank expects group profit in 2026 to come in just below the prior-year level, signalling cautious optimism and sustained discipline in its growth ambitions.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CH:GRKP\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ch:grkp\">(CH:GRKP)</a> stock is a Hold with a CHF2204.00 price target.
