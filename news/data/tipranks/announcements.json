While higher SG&amp;A, a drop in strategic partner revenue and a working-capital build weighed on reported results, executives argued that these investments are deliberate and manageable against strong underlying profitability.</p>\n<h2>Strong Consolidated and Branded Revenue Growth</h2>\n<p>Jamieson posted about 12% full-year consolidated revenue growth, with its core branded business advancing nearly 16%, underscoring the strength of its portfolio. In Q4, consolidated revenue rose 13.4% to $277.7 million, powered by Jamieson Brands’ 17.1% gain to $237.4 million and a 20.2% jump at Youtheory.</p>\n<h2>Geographic Diversification with China and International Outperformance</h2>\n<p>China remained the star, with full-year growth above 56% and Q4 up 43.9%, making the market a key growth engine. International revenue climbed 24% for the year and 39.2% in Q4, while Canada outpaced its home market with roughly 6% full-year growth and 5.5% growth in the quarter.</p>\n<h2>Gross Profit and Margin Expansion</h2>\n<p>Consolidated gross profit increased by $18.5 million in Q4 to $118.7 million, lifting consolidated gross margin by about 180 basis points and highlighting operating leverage. Jamieson Brands’ gross profit rose 19.7%, and normalized gross margin improved 90 basis points to 47.6%, helped by a richer branded mix and scale benefits in China.</p>\n<h2>Improved Profitability and Strong Adjusted Metrics</h2>\n<p>Adjusted profitability remained a bright spot, with Q4 adjusted EBITDA up 13.7% to an unchanged margin of 24.3%, showing that growth is not diluting earnings quality. Normalized earnings from operations rose 13.3% to $60.4 million, adjusted net earnings reached $38.5 million and adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.90.</p>\n<h2>High-ROI China Execution and Consumer Conversion</h2>\n<p>Management highlighted China as a high-return investment story, citing performance marketing that is translating awareness into sales. Brand awareness to trial conversion jumped 57%, and trial to regular-buyer conversion climbed 81%, allowing Jamieson to grow roughly four times faster than the broader vitamins, minerals and supplements market.</p>\n<h2>Strong Cash Position and Shareholder Returns</h2>\n<p>The company ended the year with $126.6 million in cash and available facilities, giving it ample flexibility despite near-term working-capital pressures. Jamieson returned capital aggressively, repurchasing about 1.2 million shares for $37.9 million and paying roughly $37.2 million in dividends, with a further $0.23-per-share dividend declared.</p>\n<h2>Operational Improvements and Innovation Momentum</h2>\n<p>Operationally, Jamieson completed the rollout of a new SAP system across headquarters and three manufacturing sites, a key step for scaling efficiently. Innovation continued to focus on high-demand need states like immunity, sleep, stress and energy, with a “global-to-local” model speeding successful products into new markets and retailers.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Partners Revenue Decline</h2>\n<p>Strategic Partner revenues were a weak spot, declining 4.4% in Q4, or about $1.9 million, as volumes softened and customer onboarding was delayed amid trade and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> uncertainty. Segment gross profit fell 2.4%, underscoring some sensitivity to external policy and logistics factors.</p>\n<h2>Higher SG&amp;A and One-Time Due Diligence Costs</h2>\n<p>SG&amp;A jumped 20% in Q4, or $9.8 million, as Jamieson leaned into performance marketing, especially in China, and built out global infrastructure and variable compensation. The quarter also absorbed $2.7 million of legal and professional expenses linked to due diligence on an acquisition that ultimately failed to meet return thresholds.</p>\n<h2>Reported Operating Income Nearly Flat After Investments</h2>\n<p>Despite strong growth in revenue and gross profit, reported earnings from operations were essentially flat in Q4, slipping about 0.02% as spending ramped up. Management emphasized that on a normalized basis operating income still climbed, framing the gap as largely tied to deliberate brand-building and one-off deal costs.</p>\n<h2>Working Capital Build and Cash from Operations Pressure</h2>\n<p>Cash from operations fell to $31.9 million from $37.8 million a year earlier, but performance before working capital actually improved, reflecting underlying earnings strength. The drag came from an $18.8 million working-capital increase driven by higher inventory to cushion tariff risks and port congestion, a trend management expects to continue into 2026.</p>\n<h2>M&amp;A Pipeline Caution and Deal Costs</h2>\n<p>Management signaled a cautious approach to acquisitions, noting that a recent potential deal was dropped after not meeting internal criteria even after due diligence spending. The pipeline remains focused on scaled, U.S.-based brands around $100 million or more in revenue, but timing and certainty of transactions remain unclear.</p>\n<h2>Early-Stage GLP-1-Related Opportunity and Category Sensitivities</h2>\n<p>Executives flagged GLP-1 companion products as an emerging but still modest category, with early uptake encouraging yet not material to overall results. They also cited seasonal swings, including a December immunity spike, while framing GLP-1 as a possible longer-term tailwind whose impact and timing are still difficult to forecast.</p>\n<h2>Forward-Looking Guidance and Growth Outlook</h2>\n<p>For 2026, Jamieson guided consolidated revenue to $895 million–$935 million, implying 9%–14% growth, with Jamieson Brands expected to grow 9%–13% and China projected to surge another 20%–30%. Adjusted EBITDA is forecast at $174 million–$181 million and adjusted EPS at $2.08–$2.21, alongside solid cash generation before working capital and planned investments in inventory and roughly $20 million of capex.</p>\n<p>Overall, Jamieson Wellness’ call painted a picture of a growth company investing heavily but selectively in its brands, capabilities and balance sheet resilience. For investors, the message was that strong international and China-driven expansion, rising margins and disciplined capital returns outweigh near-term noise in partner revenue, working capital and deal-related costs.</p>",

Management highlighted strong cash generation, growing production and a fortified balance sheet, even as GAAP results were hit by large non‑cash impairments and weaker commodity realizations. The tone was confident about dividend durability and upside leverage to a future recovery, while candid on near‑term volatility and activity uncertainty.</p>\n<h2>Robust Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>Northern Oil and Gas reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.63 billion for 2025, with Q4 contributing $367 million, underscoring resilient profitability in a softer price environment. Full‑year free cash flow reached $424 million and Q4 generated $43 million, showing that the business continues to throw off meaningful cash even as commodity headwinds weigh on realized pricing.</p>\n<h2>Production Growth and Record Gas Volumes</h2>\n<p>Average daily production in Q4 climbed to 140,000 BOE per day, up 7% sequentially and 6% year over year, while full‑year volumes averaged 135,000 BOE per day, a 9% increase versus 2024. The Appalachian JV was a standout, with gas volumes hitting a third straight quarterly record at 392 MMcf per day, up 11% from Q3 and 24% from the prior year.</p>\n<h2>Ground Game Delivers Acreage Expansion</h2>\n<p>The company leaned on its non‑operated “ground game” to expand its footprint, adding more than 12,000 net acres in 2025 and ending the year with roughly 12,300 plus acres and 12.8 net wells. Q4 was a record quarter, with over 6,000 net acres and 1.2 net wells acquired across 33 deals, drawn from more than 700 evaluated opportunities, highlighting a highly selective but active acquisition engine.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Utica Deal Scales Appalachia</h2>\n<p>A centerpiece of the year was the integrated Utica acquisition alongside Infinity, anchored by assets operated by Antero. The transaction boosts Northern’s Appalachian footprint by about 45% on a pro forma basis to roughly 90,000 net acres and adds more than 100 identified gross locations, providing meaningful inventory depth and optionality across both upstream and midstream.</p>\n<h2>Liquidity Bolstered and Debt Ladder Extended</h2>\n<p>Management moved aggressively on the balance sheet, extending the revolving credit facility maturity from June 2027 to November 2030 while lifting the borrowing base to $1.975 billion and elected commitments to $1.8 billion. The company also issued $725 million of notes at 7.875%, retiring most of its 2028 notes and ending the year with more than $1 billion of liquidity following the Utica close.</p>\n<h2>Cost Efficiencies and Operational Improvements</h2>\n<p>Operationally, Northern continues to benefit from longer laterals and lower well costs, with normalized lateral lengths around 13,000 feet and normalized well costs down nearly 5% quarter over quarter. Lease operating expense improved in Q4 to $9.30 per BOE, a 5% reduction versus Q3 and 3% lower than Q4 2024, reflecting efficiency gains despite a challenging cost environment.</p>\n<h2>Disciplined Capital Allocation Across Basins</h2>\n<p>For 2025, total capital spending excluding non‑budgeted acquisitions came in at $1.0 billion, including $174 million devoted to the ground game. In Q4, CapEx excluding non‑budgeted deals totaled $270 million, with about 44% directed to the Permian, 26% to the Williston, 8% to the Uinta and 22% to Appalachia, and roughly $193 million going to organic development projects.</p>\n<h2>Dividend Resilience and Hedging Support</h2>\n<p>Management underscored that the dividend is designed to be sustainable even in a significantly weaker commodity backdrop, pointing to modest EBITDA growth despite lower prices. Adjusted EBITDA rose about 1% year over year even as average oil prices fell around 14% in 2025, a performance credited largely to effective hedging and disciplined capital allocation.</p>\n<h2>Non‑Cash Impairments Cloud GAAP Results</h2>\n<p>On the downside, reported GAAP earnings were heavily impacted by $703 million of non‑cash impairments recorded over 2025, including $270 million in Q4 alone. These write‑downs were tied to the full‑cost ceiling test and lower average oil prices, underlining how accounting rules can obscure underlying cash performance even when operations remain solid.</p>\n<h2>Weaker Realizations and Wider Differentials</h2>\n<p>Commodity realizations deteriorated, with oil differentials widening to $5.05 per barrel in Q4 from $3.89 in Q3 and averaging $5.53 for the year. Natural gas pricing was particularly pressured as realizations fell to 58% of benchmark in Q4 and averaged 79% for the year, down from 93% in 2024, driven by Waha weakness, softer NGL prices and unfavorable regional dynamics.</p>\n<h2>Oil Volumes Slip and Activity Visibility Declines</h2>\n<p>While total production grew, Q4 oil volumes of 75,000 barrels per day were up 3% sequentially but down 5% versus the prior year, reflecting mix and timing effects. Management flagged high uncertainty for 2026, citing deferred completions, operator curtailments and 13 net wells elected but not yet spud, which together introduce a wide range of possible activity outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Higher Maintenance Burden Lifts LOE</h2>\n<p>Despite efficiency gains late in the year, full‑year lease operating expense rose modestly to $9.61 per BOE, up 2% from 2024. The company attributed the increase to higher workover and maintenance costs associated with supporting growing volumes, highlighting that sustaining production across a broader asset base carries an incremental cost burden.</p>\n<h2>Share Price Pressure and Multiple Compression</h2>\n<p>Management acknowledged that shareholders did not fully benefit from the operational progress, as total equity returns were negative in 2025. The stock has suffered from multiple compression amid declining oil prices and broader market skepticism toward the sector, even as Northern improved its asset base, scale and cash generation capability.</p>\n<h2>Wide‑Range 2026 Guidance Signals Flexibility</h2>\n<p>For 2026, Northern issued a two‑case framework with low‑ and high‑activity scenarios covering production, operating costs and capital spending and assuming roughly 70 to 90 net wells. The program is anchored by about 45.6 net wells in process and 13 net wells elected but not yet spud, with a basin mix of around 40% Permian, 25% Appalachia, 25% Williston and 10% Uinta and well costs trending lower with 13,000‑foot laterals.</p>\n<h2>Forward‑Looking Outlook and Capital Optionality</h2>\n<p>Guidance suggests spending will be front‑loaded, with roughly 60% of CapEx in the first half while well activity remains roughly even, and Q1 typically slower before a Q2 ramp. In the low‑activity case, Northern expects lower oil volumes but materially reduced spending and significantly higher free cash flow at current strip, while the high‑activity case assumes fewer curtailments, more turn‑in‑lines and roughly a $100 to $150 million spending delta, with strong sensitivity to oil prices and ample liquidity to pursue either path.</p>\n<p>Northern Oil and Gas exits the year as a larger, more diversified and better‑funded non‑operator, yet one still exposed to commodity swings and operator timing. Investors are being asked to look past non‑cash impairments and near‑term pricing headwinds toward a flexible 2026 plan backed by strong liquidity, visible inventory and a dividend policy built to endure the downcycle and capture upside when conditions improve.</p>",

The company’s petrochemical cracker utilization rates in Brazil and South America fell versus both the prior quarter and 2024, largely due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Bahia complex, lower feedstock supply in São Paulo and demand-driven production adjustments.</p>\n<p>Resin sales in Brazil declined in 4Q25 compared with both the previous quarter and year-ago period, as higher inventories in the transformation chain, seasonal demand softness and a strategy to favor higher value-added sales reduced PE, PP and PVC volumes. Exports of resins dipped in the quarter but rose for the full year, supported by higher PE and PP shipments to South America after a 3% contraction in Brazilian market demand freed up product for export.</p>\n<p>Sales of main chemicals in Brazil were down sharply in 4Q25 from 3Q25 and 4Q24 and lower for 2025 as a whole, reflecting reduced availability of products like gasoline and paraxylene amid lower utilization rates and weaker demand for olefins and aromatics as clients optimized their operating rates. Chemical exports jumped in the quarter due to specific opportunities for paraxylene and benzene, but fell significantly for the year on reduced gasoline exports, U.S. tariffs on benzene and weaker toluene demand amid substitution in the domestic market.</p>\n<p>In the United States and Europe, Braskem faced lower polypropylene spreads in 4Q25 as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> expanded supply, while utilization rates declined due to scheduled maintenance in Europe, further weighing on regional performance. In Mexico, however, the company achieved its highest utilization rate since early 2017, driven by stable operations after a major 3Q25 maintenance shutdown and increased imported ethane availability, particularly from the Terminal Química Puerto México, supporting a stronger operational contribution from that segment.</p>\n<p>The company’s green ethylene operations saw utilization rates rebound sharply from 3Q25 after inventory optimization, though they remained below 4Q24 and full-year 2024 levels due to an unscheduled power-related shutdown earlier in 2025 and deliberate Green PE inventory adjustments. Overall, the data underscore how maintenance cycles, feedstock constraints and weaker global petrochemical fundamentals weighed on Braskem’s 2025 operating profile, while targeted export strategies and improved Mexican utilization provided partial offsets for stakeholders monitoring capacity use and market exposure.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"BAK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bak\">(BAK)</a> stock is a Hold with a $3.50 price target.

( <a data-ticker=\"AARD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aard\">(AARD)</a> ).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p>On February 27, 2026, Aardvark Therapeutics said it had voluntarily paused enrollment and dosing in its Phase 3 HERO trial of ARD-101 for hyperphagia in Prader-Willi Syndrome, along with the related open-label extension study. The move followed reversible cardiac findings at above-target therapeutic doses in a separate healthy volunteer study, triggering a comprehensive data review and a delay to the previously expected third-quarter 2026 topline readout.</p>\n<p>Management emphasized that patient safety is the highest priority and that it remains committed to advancing ARD-101 while reassessing optimal dosing and working closely with regulators and clinical experts. The pause, while precautionary, introduces timing uncertainty for Aardvark’s lead program in a rare disease setting where ARD-101 holds Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations, potentially affecting expectations for the company’s near-term clinical and strategic milestones.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AARD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aard\">(AARD)</a> stock is a Buy with a $26.00 price target.

Offsetting factors include favorable technical momentum (price above major moving averages with positive MACD) and positive corporate pipeline milestones (Phase 3 HERO trial progress and updated program communications), while valuation remains constrained by ongoing losses and a negative P/E.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on AARD stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aard/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.</u></b></p>\n<p>Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel small-molecule drugs to suppress hunger for Prader-Willi Syndrome and broader metabolic diseases. Its lead oral candidate, ARD-101, is in late-stage development for hyperphagia in PWS, while ARD-201, a fixed-dose combination of ARD-101 with a DPP-4 inhibitor, is being advanced through Phase 2 trials targeting limitations of existing GLP-1-based obesity treatments.</p>\n<p>The company’s approach focuses on hunger-specific neural pathways, distinct from appetite-driven reward mechanisms, and explores complementary use with anti-appetite therapies. ARD-101, a gut-restricted bitter taste receptor agonist that stimulates gut hormones such as GLP-1 and CCK, has received Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for PWS, underscoring its focus on rare metabolic indications and potential regulatory advantages.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 188,388</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Strong Buy</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> $276.1M</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p>See more data about AARD stock on <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aard\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">TipRanks’ Stock Analysis page</a></span>.</p><p></p>",
