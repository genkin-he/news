Despite these pressures, the company cited its GRO AHT cost and revenue initiatives as driving more than $40 million of EBITDA improvement in 2025, including 2.4% growth in comparable Hotel EBITDA and over $13 million in corporate G&amp;A savings, though it nonetheless posted a 2025 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $215 million and negative AFFO.</p>\n<p>Management detailed an aggressive capital-structure and portfolio streamlining program, noting the payoff of remaining corporate-level debt in early 2025 and the completed sale of six hotels for about $145 million, plus agreements to sell three additional properties expected to generate significant capex savings and improve cash flow after debt service. The company also disclosed a maturity default on its $325 million JPM8 mortgage loan secured by eight hotels, while emphasizing that dispositions and potential handing back of assets could improve leverage and future capital needs, and reiterated that a special committee formed in early December 2025 is evaluating strategic alternatives to address the gap between the portfolio’s perceived value and the market price of its common stock.</p>\n<p>Operationally, Ashford reported that comparable hotel RevPAR fell 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2025 year-over-year, largely due to a federal government shutdown that began in October and drove a 27.9% decline in government-related room nights, with outsized impact on its Washington, D.C. exposure. Excluding the D.C. market, comparable RevPAR was flat and total revenue increased slightly, underscoring the company’s view that its ongoing asset sales, debt extensions, and performance initiatives are creating a leaner, more resilient portfolio despite constrained liquidity and continued industry uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AHT\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht\">(AHT)</a> stock is a Hold with a $4.00 price target.

The warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $6,000, include standard anti-dilution adjustments and ownership caps that limit any holder’s stake to 4.99%, or up to 9.99% at the investor’s election, reflecting a modest capital raise structured to manage dilution and concentration risk for existing shareholders.</p>\n<p>The transaction, launched on February 19, 2026 and announced via press release on February 26, 2026, was conducted under Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, with Zoomcar verifying all purchasers as accredited investors.

Revenue grew 17% to MNOK 1,775 on higher average cabin rates and solid demand, though fourth-quarter earnings were weighed by lower occupancy linked to a delayed sales campaign and heavier marketing spend aimed at boosting future bookings.</p>\n<p>Operating expenses increased 7% as the company expanded its onshore organisation and stepped up sales and marketing, while renegotiated bunkering agreements and LNG price movements helped contain fuel and port costs. A major debt refinancing of MEUR 456 secured 15-year vessel financing, cut the effective interest cost to about 10%, and improved financial flexibility even as reported accounting equity remained negative due to currency effects, contrasted with positive value-adjusted equity based on vessel market values.</p>\n<p>On the sustainability front, Havila Kystruten reduced CO2 emissions 36% versus its 2017 coastal route baseline and completed its first climate-neutral voyage using liquefied biogas and large battery packs, achieving about 92% lifecycle CO2 cuts and eliminating local NOx and SOx emissions on that trip. With 63% of 2026 capacity already booked as of February and cabin-night bookings nearly 20% above the prior year, management expects continued revenue growth and margin improvement supported by the 2025 investments in marketing, sales and organisational capabilities.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Havila Kystruten AS</u></b></p>\n<p>Havila Kystruten AS operates four modern cruise-passenger vessels along the Norwegian coastal route, combining government-contracted coastal transport with commercial passenger services and onboard sales.
