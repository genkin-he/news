Morgan Securities on the London Stock Exchange and CBOE Europe at volume-weighted average prices around 386 pence. The company plans to cancel these shares, part of a broader programme under which 7,848,988 shares have been bought back since November 2025, leaving 824,065,705 shares in issue and modestly enhancing earnings per share and capital returns for investors.</p>\n<p>The latest tranche of repurchases underscores Rotork’s ongoing use of surplus capital to manage its balance sheet and signal confidence in its long-term prospects, in line with the authority granted at the 2025 AGM. By shrinking its equity base and avoiding holding treasury shares, the group reinforces shareholder-focused capital allocation at a time when many UK industrials are using buybacks to support valuations in a competitive global market for engineering assets.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"GB:ROR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:ror\">(GB:ROR)</a> stock is a Buy with a £415.00 price target.
