Despite these pressures, the company cited its GRO AHT cost and revenue initiatives as driving more than $40 million of EBITDA improvement in 2025, including 2.4% growth in comparable Hotel EBITDA and over $13 million in corporate G&amp;A savings, though it nonetheless posted a 2025 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $215 million and negative AFFO.</p>\n<p>Management detailed an aggressive capital-structure and portfolio streamlining program, noting the payoff of remaining corporate-level debt in early 2025 and the completed sale of six hotels for about $145 million, plus agreements to sell three additional properties expected to generate significant capex savings and improve cash flow after debt service. The company also disclosed a maturity default on its $325 million JPM8 mortgage loan secured by eight hotels, while emphasizing that dispositions and potential handing back of assets could improve leverage and future capital needs, and reiterated that a special committee formed in early December 2025 is evaluating strategic alternatives to address the gap between the portfolio’s perceived value and the market price of its common stock.</p>\n<p>Operationally, Ashford reported that comparable hotel RevPAR fell 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2025 year-over-year, largely due to a federal government shutdown that began in October and drove a 27.9% decline in government-related room nights, with outsized impact on its Washington, D.C. exposure.
