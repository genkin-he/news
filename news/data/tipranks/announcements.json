The project envisions ramping up to 16,000 tonnes per day, with measured and indicated resources of 644,000 gold-equivalent ounces and additional inferred resources, underscoring the scale of the deposit.</p>\n<p>The updated PEA highlights an after-tax net present value of $224 million and internal rate of return of 50% at base case metal prices, with significantly higher economics at current spot prices. Management notes that only a fraction of known mineralized zones have been drilled and the concession area has nearly tripled, suggesting considerable potential to expand both production capacity and mine life, which could enhance Sonoro’s growth profile and attractiveness to investors and potential partners.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"TSE:SGO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:sgo\">(TSE:SGO)</a> stock is a Hold with a C$0.29 price target.

The company has requested a waiver of the fine, arguing that as a government enterprise, director appointments rest with the President of India and that it has been regularly apprising the Ministry of Coal about the need for additional independent directors, asserting the lapse was beyond management’s control.</p>\n<p>The case underscores ongoing governance and compliance challenges for government-owned listed entities, where regulatory obligations can clash with slower state-controlled appointment processes, potentially leading to recurring disclosure and penalty issues.
