The company stated that noteholders’ legal rights under the existing trust deeds remain unaffected by the transition, signalling an administrative adjustment rather than a change in the terms or security of these hybrid instruments.</p>\n<p>The trustee replacement took effect on 26 February 2026 under a Deed of Retirement and Appointment of Trustee, and formal notice has been given to all holders of Capital Notes 3, 4 and 5. The move is positioned as continuity of trust administration within the MSC group, limiting operational disruption for Suncorp and preserving stability for investors in its listed capital notes.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:SUN\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:sun\">(AU:SUN)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$16.00 price target.
