Discovery entity holding the company’s Streaming &amp; Studios businesses, leaving WBD’s Global Linear Networks and certain other assets separated.

Discovery notified Netflix that a revised offer from Paramount Skydance Corporation constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement. Netflix waived its right to negotiate changes, and on February 27, 2026, WBD terminated the deal with Netflix to sign a merger agreement with Paramount Skydance, triggering a $2.8 billion termination fee payable to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement on February 27, 2026, all related financing commitments arranged by Netflix, including a bridge commitment letter, incremental bridge facility, a 2025 revolving credit facility and a delayed draw term loan, were automatically canceled.
