The Bambach Wires and Cables unit narrowed its loss slightly, while the board completed a review of strategic opportunities and refreshed leadership, and the company shored up working capital by raising $3.78 million in loans, converting $1.55 million of borrowings to equity and repaying $0.4 million in debt, underscoring continued financial pressure but some balance sheet repair and strategic repositioning.</p>\n<p>No interim or final dividend was declared for the period, reflecting the company’s continued losses and focus on capital management.

The company did not declare or pay any dividends for the period, indicating a continued focus on conserving capital for operations and development activities rather than returning cash to shareholders.</p>\n<p>Despite the swing to loss, Racura’s net tangible assets per share improved to 11.71 cents from 10.39 cents, suggesting the balance sheet asset backing per security has strengthened. The absence of changes in control over entities and the lack of a dividend reinvestment plan point to a relatively stable corporate structure, with stakeholders’ attention likely to remain on how management steers the business back toward profitability while sustaining asset value.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:RAC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:rac\">(AU:RAC)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$2.00 price target.
