The company appointed U.S.-based quality and operations veteran Daniel Core to its board, adding him to both the audit and compensation committees to bolster governance, compliance oversight, and operational risk management.</p>\n<p>Effective the same day, directors Aimar Dimo and Gloria Montaron Estrada resigned from the board, marking a notable refresh of Moolec’s governance structure. The changes signal an increased emphasis on industrial-quality discipline and regulatory frameworks as the company advances its technology-driven, seed-to-ingredient strategy across its key markets in the United States, Europe, and South America.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"MLEC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mlec\">(MLEC)</a> stock is a Hold with a $17.50 price target.

Technicals are a partial offset with strong momentum and price above key moving averages, though the very high RSI indicates an overextended setup. Valuation is also constrained by negative earnings and no dividend support.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on MLEC stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mlec/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Moolec Science</u></b></p>\n<p>Moolec Science SA is a Nasdaq-listed food technology company that engineers plants and microbes to produce scalable protein solutions for the global food system.
