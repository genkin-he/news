Brennan, PhD, who shifted to Chair of the Audit Committee, while fellow director Jolie Hunt became Chair of the Executive Compensation Committee. The leadership reshuffle, formally announced on February 26, 2026, reflects a governance refresh that leverages existing directors’ experience in executive pay, audit oversight, and ESG-related strategy during a period of transformation for the REIT.</p>\n<p>Also on February 24, 2026, the board expanded from seven to nine members and named real estate and capital-markets veterans Cia Buckley Marakovits and David Kieske as independent directors, granting them standard non-employee director compensation and initial restricted stock unit awards that vest over two years. The board simultaneously restructured its committee framework by disbanding the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee, reallocating ESG and human capital oversight among the Nominating/Corporate Governance, Executive Compensation, and Audit committees, and disclosed that long-serving director Peter Stoneberg will retire at the 2026 annual meeting, at which point the board will shrink to eight members.</p>\n<p>These moves aim to streamline governance, integrate sustainability and human capital oversight more deeply into core board committees, and strengthen financial and investment expertise at the board level. For shareholders and other stakeholders, the changes signal an effort to align Kilroy’s board composition and governance structure with the evolving demands of the office and life science real estate markets, as the company navigates a dynamic operating environment and ongoing portfolio evolution.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"KRC\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/krc\">(KRC)</a> stock is a Hold with a $31.00 price target.
