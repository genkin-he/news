            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Comcast Corporation is a global media and technology company that provides broadband, wireless, and video services through brands like Xfinity and Sky, and produces and distributes entertainment content through NBC, Universal, and Peacock, among others. In its third-quarter earnings report for 2025, Comcast highlighted its strategic focus on strengthening its broadband and wireless offerings, with a record addition of 414,000 wireless lines. The company also noted significant revenue growth in its Theme Parks segment, driven by the success of Epic Universe, and a solid performance in Business Services. Despite a 2.7% decline in overall revenue compared to the previous year, largely due to the absence of Olympic-related income, Comcast reported a robust free cash flow of $4.9 billion, showcasing the resilience of its business model. Key financial metrics included a slight decrease in net income and earnings per share, while adjusted EBITDA remained stable. The company returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead, Comcast’s management remains focused on long-term growth, leveraging its diversified portfolio to navigate the evolving media landscape.</p>",
