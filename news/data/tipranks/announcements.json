The waiver was granted to address Mazij’s urgent personal financial needs, with the board noting that the company had already released preliminary unaudited 2025 results and determining he did not hold material non-public financial information.</p>\n<p>The sale, conducted via Mazij’s holding company K.A.V.O. Holdings Limited at C$2.00 per share for gross proceeds of C$2,078,000, reduced his direct and indirect stake from 17.70% to 13.55% of Bragg’s outstanding shares. The purchaser agreed to a six-month lock-up and a non-disclosure agreement, and while Bragg does not expect further blackout waivers, the CEO may still adjust his holdings over time depending on market conditions and investment considerations.\n</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"TSE:BRAG\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tse:brag\">(TSE:BRAG)</a> stock is a Buy with a C$7.00 price target.

The company has since executed a strategic exit from its conventional Argentine operations, selling its stakes in the Santa Cruz Sur joint operations and the La Brea Block, alongside related rights in MMO and CR, to a local investor for up to USD 1.0 million in contingent payments plus an 80% overriding royalty on profits above defined production thresholds, reshaping its exposure to the Argentine market.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about InterOil Exploration and Production ASA</u></b></p>\n<p>Interoil Exploration and Production ASA is a Norwegian-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker IOX.
