            "description": "<p></p>\n<p></p><p>Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has announced a new clinical study titled ‘TRITON-PN: A Phase 3, Global, Randomized, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Nucresiran in Patients With Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis With Polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN).’ The study aims to assess the efficacy of nucresiran in improving neurologic impairment, quality of life, nutritional status, disability, and gait speed in patients with hATTR-PN, while also comparing its effectiveness to vutrisiran in reducing serum transthyretin levels.</p>\n<p>The study will test two interventions: Nucresiran, administered subcutaneously at 300 mg every six months, and Vutrisiran, administered at 25 mg every three months followed by Nucresiran. These drugs are designed to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy by targeting and reducing transthyretin levels.</p>\n<p>This Phase 3 study is interventional, with a randomized allocation and a parallel intervention model. It is open-label, meaning no masking is involved, and its primary purpose is treatment-focused.</p>\n<p>Key dates for the study include a start date of October 29, 2025, with the primary completion and estimated completion dates yet to be announced. The last update was also submitted on October 29, 2025, indicating the study is in its initial stages.</p>\n<p>The announcement of this study could influence Alnylam Pharmaceuticals’ stock performance positively, as successful results may enhance investor confidence and market position. The study’s progress will be closely watched by industry competitors and investors, given the potential market impact of a new treatment for hATTR-PN.</p>\n<p>The TRITON-PN study is currently ongoing, with further details available on the ClinicalTrials portal.</p><p></p>",
