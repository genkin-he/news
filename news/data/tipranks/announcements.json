The delay is primarily due to time constraints in compiling and reviewing the necessary information, which has made it impractical to file on time without undue hardship and expense. The company expects to file the report no later than the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date. There is an anticipation of significant changes in financial results from the previous fiscal year, and the notification includes forward-looking statements concerning these expectations.
