It is advancing two co-flagship tungsten projects in Nevada: Pilot Mountain, one of the largest undeveloped tungsten deposits in the U.S., and Tempiute, a historic major tungsten producer, positioning the firm within a top-tier U.S. mining jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The company has attracted U.S. government support, with the Department of War investing US$6.2 million in its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary in 2025 to advance a pre-feasibility study at Pilot Mountain. Guardian Metal has also signalled plans to pursue a U.S. listing in the first half of 2026, aligning its capital markets presence with its strategic role in securing domestic supplies of tungsten, a critical metal for defense, energy transition, technology and industrial applications.</p>\n<p>Against a backdrop of shifting geopolitical dynamics and tightening Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals, Guardian Metal aims to become a key player in rebuilding a secure, domestically mined U.S. tungsten supply chain. This strategic positioning underscores its importance to stakeholders seeking reduced reliance on foreign sources for vital defense-related metals and potential exposure to a structurally important part of the minerals sector.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 393,526</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Hold</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> £366.1M</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p>See more insights into GMET stock on <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gb:gmet\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">TipRanks’ Stock Analysis page</a></span>.</p><p></p>",
