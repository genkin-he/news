The company’s petrochemical cracker utilization rates in Brazil and South America fell versus both the prior quarter and 2024, largely due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Bahia complex, lower feedstock supply in São Paulo and demand-driven production adjustments.</p>\n<p>Resin sales in Brazil declined in 4Q25 compared with both the previous quarter and year-ago period, as higher inventories in the transformation chain, seasonal demand softness and a strategy to favor higher value-added sales reduced PE, PP and PVC volumes. Exports of resins dipped in the quarter but rose for the full year, supported by higher PE and PP shipments to South America after a 3% contraction in Brazilian market demand freed up product for export.</p>\n<p>Sales of main chemicals in Brazil were down sharply in 4Q25 from 3Q25 and 4Q24 and lower for 2025 as a whole, reflecting reduced availability of products like gasoline and paraxylene amid lower utilization rates and weaker demand for olefins and aromatics as clients optimized their operating rates. Chemical exports jumped in the quarter due to specific opportunities for paraxylene and benzene, but fell significantly for the year on reduced gasoline exports, U.S. tariffs on benzene and weaker toluene demand amid substitution in the domestic market.</p>\n<p>In the United States and Europe, Braskem faced lower polypropylene spreads in 4Q25 as higher <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/economic-indicators\">imports</a> expanded supply, while utilization rates declined due to scheduled maintenance in Europe, further weighing on regional performance. In Mexico, however, the company achieved its highest utilization rate since early 2017, driven by stable operations after a major 3Q25 maintenance shutdown and increased imported ethane availability, particularly from the Terminal Química Puerto México, supporting a stronger operational contribution from that segment.</p>\n<p>The company’s green ethylene operations saw utilization rates rebound sharply from 3Q25 after inventory optimization, though they remained below 4Q24 and full-year 2024 levels due to an unscheduled power-related shutdown earlier in 2025 and deliberate Green PE inventory adjustments. Overall, the data underscore how maintenance cycles, feedstock constraints and weaker global petrochemical fundamentals weighed on Braskem’s 2025 operating profile, while targeted export strategies and improved Mexican utilization provided partial offsets for stakeholders monitoring capacity use and market exposure.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"BAK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bak\">(BAK)</a> stock is a Hold with a $3.50 price target.

The move followed reversible cardiac findings at above-target therapeutic doses in a separate healthy volunteer study, triggering a comprehensive data review and a delay to the previously expected third-quarter 2026 topline readout.</p>\n<p>Management emphasized that patient safety is the highest priority and that it remains committed to advancing ARD-101 while reassessing optimal dosing and working closely with regulators and clinical experts.
