The company reinforced its growth-through-M&amp;A strategy by prioritizing acquisitions for capital deployment, highlighted by the SPI deal that strengthens its leadership in mechanical insulation, and it returned $434.2 million to shareholders via buybacks as it set a 2026 outlook of $5.925 billion to $6.225 billion in sales and $1.005 billion to $1.155 billion in adjusted EBITDA.\n</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"BLD\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bld\">(BLD)</a> stock is a Buy with a $620.00 price target.

This represents the first global regulatory filing for the potential first-in-class therapy in a country where nearly one million people live with the disease and chronic hepatitis B remains a leading cause of liver cancer.</p>\n<p>The filing is backed by positive Phase III B-Well 1 and B-Well 2 trial data, in which bepirovirsen plus standard of care achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful functional cure rates versus standard care alone, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. The drug, licensed from Ionis and already granted SENKU designation in Japan as well as other expedited statuses globally, could materially strengthen GSK’s position in hepatitis B if approved, opening a new market opportunity and potentially reshaping the standard of care in a large, underserved patient population.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"GSK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gsk\">(GSK)</a> stock is a Hold with a $70.00 price target.
