These asset sales reduced operational complexity, boosted the share of investment-grade tenants to 80% among the top ten, and allowed the company to cut outstanding debt by more than $2.8 billion, improving Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA from 8.4x to 6.7x and positioning the REIT as a pure-play single-tenant net lease platform.</p>\n<p>The company used its stronger balance sheet to refinance a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility with longer maturities and better pricing, contributing to credit upgrades from Fitch to investment-grade BBB- and bond upgrades to investment-grade at S&amp;P Global. GNL also repurchased 17.2 million shares through February 20, 2026 at an implied AFFO yield of about 12%, helping drive a 32% total return in 2025 versus 6% for the net lease sector, while 97% occupancy, robust leasing spreads and AFFO per share of $0.99, above guidance, underscored improved earnings quality and supported a strategic shift from deleveraging toward capital recycling into industrial and retail acquisitions on a leverage-neutral basis.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"GNL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gnl\">(GNL)</a> stock is a Hold with a $10.50 price target.

Technicals are supportive with the stock trading above key moving averages and a positive MACD. Valuation is mixed—high yield helps, but the negative P/E reflects ongoing profitability challenges. Earnings call tone is favorable due to deleveraging progress, liquidity improvements, and capital allocation actions, but tempered by lower 2026 AFFO guidance and office-related execution risk.</p>\n<p>To see Spark’s full report on GNL stock, <span class=\"tr-stock-ticker\" style=\"color:blue\"><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gnl/ai-stock-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" ;=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">click here</a></span>. </p>\n<p><b><u>More about Global Net Lease</u></b></p>\n<p>Global Net Lease, Inc. is a real estate investment trust focused on owning and managing a diversified portfolio of single-tenant net lease properties, primarily industrial and retail assets.

Structured entirely as performance-based restricted stock units split evenly between relative total shareholder return and relative earnings per share goals versus the S&amp;P 500, the award features a five-year vesting period, above-market performance hurdles starting at the 40th percentile, and potential payouts ranging from 0% to 175% of target, tying Kohli’s long-term compensation tightly to CBRE’s comparative shareholder returns and earnings growth.</p>\n<p>The award’s rTSR portion will measure cumulative total shareholder return from February 25, 2026, to January 31, 2031, while the rEPS portion will track Core EPS growth against peers’ GAAP EPS growth from January 1, 2026, to December 31, 2030, with vesting occurring after performance certification but no later than February 25, 2031. By extending vesting to five years and requiring performance above median for enhanced payouts, CBRE is signaling a strong commitment to rigorous pay-for-performance alignment, executive retention and competitive positioning in the S&amp;P 500 peer set, potentially reassuring investors about long-term leadership stability and disciplined incentive design.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"CBRE\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cbre\">(CBRE)</a> stock is a Buy with a $180.00 price target.

The board declared a first-quarter 2026 regular dividend of $0.45 per share and highlighted modest net deployment, a $3.8 billion predominantly first-lien debt portfolio, and the post-quarter launch of Capstone Lending LLC, a joint venture that expands its lending capacity alongside an institutional partner.</p>\n<p>For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, total investment income slipped to $96.6 million from $99.7 million, mainly due to lower base rates, while net expenses declined on a reduced incentive fee, and the company recorded unrealized depreciation and realized losses totaling $13.7 million. The launch of the Capstone Lending joint venture, supported by capital commitments of up to $200 million from the company and $50 million from its partner with nearly half initially called in February 2026, underscores a strategic move to scale origination and maintain its position in the competitive direct lending market while continuing to return capital through regular dividends.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"MSDL\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msdl\">(MSDL)</a> stock is a Hold with a $18.00 price target.

The result was heavily influenced by non-cash items, including a sizeable gain from the deconsolidation of White Graphene Ltd, a reversal of prior impairment on its Li-S Energy stake, and the reclassification of key nanomaterials holdings as associates, while the board opted against paying an interim dividend.</p>\n<p>Despite the headline profit, PPK’s underlying performance before tax remained loss-making, with the group posting an unaudited underlying pre-tax loss of $1.8 million once non-operating and non-cash impacts were stripped out. The restructuring of its portfolio, including the merger of White Graphene and BNNT Technology into a single nanomaterials business and reduced control over that asset, signals an ongoing shift toward an associate-investment model in advanced materials and energy storage, with implications for future earnings volatility and the balance between recurring operating returns and valuation-driven gains.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:PPK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:ppk\">(AU:PPK)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$0.39 price target.
