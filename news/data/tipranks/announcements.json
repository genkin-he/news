The infrastructure is anchored by a 20-year lease with Telefónica, which currently uses only a small portion of the network’s 24 available fiber pairs, alongside capacity leased to Marcatel.</p>\n<p>In a February 27, 2026 announcement, Akanda and FTF outlined plans to expand leasing of this underutilized dark fiber network starting in 2026, aiming to add more tenants and boost recurring revenue with limited additional capital outlay. Management argues that the network’s scale, redundancy and available capacity position FTF as a key shared infrastructure provider for rising connectivity demand in Central Mexico, with potential implications for the region’s telecom competition and for Akanda’s long-term revenue mix.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Akanda Corp</u></b></p>\n<p>First Towers &amp; Fiber Corp. is an emerging telecommunications infrastructure developer in Mexico, focused on cellular tower construction and dark fiber networks. The company partners with national carriers and technology providers to deliver scalable, reliable connectivity solutions that support commercial growth and digital inclusion in fast-growing regional markets.</p>\n<p><b>Average Trading Volume:</b> 1,376,505</p>\n<p><b>Technical Sentiment Signal:</b> Sell</p>\n<p><b>Current Market Cap:</b> $1.85M</p>\n<p></p>",

Discovery entity holding the company’s Streaming &amp; Studios businesses, leaving WBD’s Global Linear Networks and certain other assets separated. This structure was designed to make the retained WBD streaming and studio operations a wholly owned Netflix subsidiary, supported by a package of committed bridge and term financing arrangements.</p>\n<p>However, on February 26, 2026, Warner Bros. Discovery notified Netflix that a revised offer from Paramount Skydance Corporation constituted a superior proposal under the merger agreement. Netflix waived its right to negotiate changes, and on February 27, 2026, WBD terminated the deal with Netflix to sign a merger agreement with Paramount Skydance, triggering a $2.8 billion termination fee payable to Netflix.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the termination of the merger agreement on February 27, 2026, all related financing commitments arranged by Netflix, including a bridge commitment letter, incremental bridge facility, a 2025 revolving credit facility and a delayed draw term loan, were automatically canceled. These facilities had been intended to fund the proposed acquisition and associated costs, so their termination effectively unwinds the capital structure Netflix had put in place for the abandoned transaction.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"NFLX\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nflx\">(NFLX)</a> stock is a Buy with a $120.00 price target.

The move increases the company’s drawing capacity to €1.35 million as of February 26, 2026, extends its cash runway by about four months, and is framed by management as a vote of confidence in its strategy and late-stage clinical programs in obesity and sarcopenia.</p>\n<p>Under the revised terms, each bond bears 12% interest and is redeemable in cash on a bi-monthly schedule over 24 months, while in a default scenario the debt could be repaid in shares at a fixed premium price, implying potential but limited dilution for existing shareholders.
