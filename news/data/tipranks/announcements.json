The plaintiff in the case has applied for leave to appeal and for a stay of that court order, which, if granted, could reinstate or extend the injunction’s restrictive effects.</p>\n<p>The company warns that any stay of the discharge order may prolong limitations on issuing new shares and engaging placement agents, constraining its options to address external auditors’ integrity and audit concerns. Management cautions that this could further jeopardise the timely completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2025 and hinder publication of its 2025 audited annual results by 31 March 2026, potentially affecting shareholders and investors.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1376\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1376\">(HK:1376)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$0.12 price target.
