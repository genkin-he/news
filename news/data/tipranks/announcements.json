The study underpins an initial 11-year mine life, with higher-intensity mining in the first two years to access higher-grade ore and build stockpiles that support later production.</p>\n<p>The DFS points to strong project economics, including high pre-tax NPVs, internal rates of return, and rapid payback periods under both spot and consensus silver price cases. With an all-in sustaining cost of A$39.70 per ounce and a relatively modest A$260 million peak funding requirement, the project is positioned as a high-margin, finance-ready development featuring sizable low-grade stockpiles that bolster downside protection and lender confidence.</p>\n<p>The ore reserves and mineral resources that support the production target have been prepared under the JORC Code by independent Competent Persons, reinforcing the technical foundations of the project. Paris also offers leverage to higher silver prices and sits within a 15-kilometre mineralised corridor, giving the company district-scale growth options via potential satellite deposits near the planned processing plant and tailings storage facility.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"AU:IVR\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:ivr\">(AU:IVR)</a> stock is a Hold with a A$0.12 price target.
