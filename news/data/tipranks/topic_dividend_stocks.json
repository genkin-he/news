            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Dow is a leading global materials science company that leverages chemistry, biology, and physics expertise to provide innovative products and solutions for high-growth markets including packaging, infrastructure, mobility, and consumer applications.</p>\n<p>The company’s claims about <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/class-action/dow-faces-investor-fury-over-alleged-misstatements\">mitigating certain macroeconomic risks</a> and impact from U.S. reciprocal tariffs are at the heart of the current complaint.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Dow’s Misleading Claims</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the lawsuit, Dow and three of its senior officers (the Defendants) repeatedly made false and misleading public statements throughout the Class Period. In particular, they are accused of omitting truthful information about the effect of certain macroeconomic challenges on the company’s business, and its ability to maintain the financial flexibility needed to support its lucrative <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dow/dividends\">dividend</a>, from SEC filings and related material.</p>\n<p>In a press release at the beginning of the Class Period, the CEO expressed confidence that the company would benefit from completing near-term growth projects and maintaining operational discipline in 2025. Dow also expected increased demand in key end markets like packaging, energy, and electronics.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dow/earnings\">fiscal 2024 annual report</a> Dow stated that it expects to grow volumes and improve profit margins by adding new polyethylene capacity and improving reliability, particularly in Packaging &amp; Specialty Plastics.</p>\n<p>Finally, in a press release dated April 24, 2025, the CEO stated that despite ongoing economic challenges, the company achieved six straight quarters of growth in volume (year-over-year) while focusing on <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dow/financials/income-statement\">cost reduction</a> and capacity adjustments to strengthen financial flexibility and support balanced capital allocation.</p>\n<p>However, subsequent events (detailed below) revealed that the defendants had failed to inform investors that the company had failed to maintain the financial flexibility needed to support its lucrative dividend.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plaintiffs’ Arguments</strong></h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs maintain that the defendants deceived investors by lying and withholding critical information about the company’s business practices and prospects during the Class Period. Importantly, the defendants failed to inform investors about the true extent and seriousness of the negative impacts from economic and market challenges on Dow’s business and financial condition.</p>\n<p>The information became clear on July 24, 2025, roughly a month after BMO Capital downgraded its recommendation on Dow’s performance and lowered the price target on its stock.</p>\n<p>In the press release, Dow’s CEO attributed the company’s disappointing second-quarter financial results, including a loss of $801 million, to the industry’s prolonged low earnings environment and uncertainties from recent trade and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> issues.</p>\n<p>Dow announced in a separate press release the same day that it was <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/dow-inc-dow-slashes-dividend-by-50\">cutting its quarterly dividend from $0.70 to $0.35 per share</a> to enhance financial flexibility amid ongoing challenges in the economy. The CEO stated this move was necessary due to a persistently difficult macroeconomic environment affecting the industry. Following the news, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dow/historical-prices\">DOW stock plunged 16.3%</a>.</p>\n<p>To conclude, the defendants failed to inform investors about the true extent of negative impacts on Dow’s business and finances, especially from competition, pricing pressure, weaker global sales and demand, and excess product supply in global markets. Due to these issues, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/dow\">DOW stock has lost nearly 33%</a> year-to-date.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>The Chicago-based restaurant chain announced that its new quarterly dividend will be $1.86, a 5% increase over what it previously paid. With the latest increase, McDonald’s has increased its quarterly dividend for 49 years in a row. The company is on track to hit the 50-year mark with its dividend increase, a development that will make McDonald’s a “Dividend King.”</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/mcdonalds-raises-quarterly-dividend-5-to-1-86-per-share-thefly\">the latest dividend increase</a>, MCD stock is now paying stockholders $7.44 per share over the course of a year. That translates into a yield of approximately 2.45% based on the current share price of $303.72.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Steady Income</strong></h2>\n<p>McDonald’s is widely viewed as one of the best <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> available to investors. Analysts say that consistent profits and cash flow enable McDonald’s to pay a regular dividend and raise it each year, increasing stockholders’ dividend income in the process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd\">MCD stock has gained 7%</a> this year. While that is below the 18% gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, the dividend yield gives the stock an added boost and provides investors with an incentive to continue holding shares. McDonald’s has consistently paid a dividend every year since 1976. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is MCD Stock a Buy?</strong></h2>\n<p>McDonald’s stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 26 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buy and 13 Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mcd/forecast\">average MCD price target </a>of $326.14 implies 7.48% upside from current levels. </p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Realty Income Keeps Monthly Checks Flowing</strong></h2>\n<p>Realty Income <a data-ticker=\"O\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/o\">(O)</a>, known as “The Monthly Dividend Company,” has paid 664 consecutive monthly dividends, and counting. The real estate investment trust owns a diversified retail portfolio with an occupancy rate above 97%, even during the 2008 downturn.</p>\n<p>Its <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/o/dividends\">5.34% yield and sustainable 75% payout ratio</a> make it one of the most dependable income plays in the market. If it can keep paying through recessions, investors can count on it in calmer times.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verizon Reduces Debt and Rewards Patience</strong></h2>\n<p>Verizon <a data-ticker=\"VZ\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vz\">(VZ)</a> has turned skepticism into opportunity. After weathering the Fed’s rate hikes with a heavy debt load, the telecom giant kept its dividend streak alive and is now positioned to benefit as borrowing costs fall.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/vz/dividends\">company’s 7.01% forward yield</a> and 21 consecutive years of dividend growth stand out. With AI infrastructure expanding and rate cuts on deck, Verizon’s free cash flow is set to strengthen. This would leave more room for future hikes in dividend payouts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Duke Energy Builds Growth and Predictability</strong></h2>\n<p>Duke Energy <a data-ticker=\"DUK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/duk\">(DUK)</a> powers millions of homes across the Southeast and Midwest. <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/duk/dividends\">With a 3.3% yield</a> and 14 years of payout increases, it remains a favorite among defensive investors.</p>\n<p>The company’s $87 billion five-year capital plan aims to expand its rate base, backed by supportive regulation and rising electricity demand from AI data centers. Its 66% payout ratio suggests room to grow without straining cash.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Coca-Cola Extends Its Dividend Legacy</strong></h2>\n<p>Coca-Cola <a data-ticker=\"KO\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ko\">(KO)</a> remains the benchmark for dividend reliability. The company has raised its dividend for 62 straight years, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ko/dividends\">with a modest 2.89% yield</a> and an exceptionally low 16% payout ratio that leaves plenty of room for growth.</p>\n<p>Its global brand power and defensive business model make it a natural hedge in any portfolio. KO’s consistency is its edge, especially because not many stocks have turned buying a soft drink into a decades-long compounding strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Merck Expands Its Pipeline and Payouts</strong></h2>\n<p>Merck <a data-ticker=\"MRK\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mrk\">(MRK)</a> rounds out the list with one of the healthiest balance sheets in healthcare. Despite concerns about upcoming Keytruda patent expirations, the company has 20 potential blockbuster drugs in development that could generate over $50 billion in future revenue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mrk/dividends\">With a 3.7% forward yield</a>, 41% payout ratio, and 14 straight years of dividend hikes, Merck’s steady R&amp;D reinvestment and cost discipline make it a rare mix of income and innovation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></h2>\n<p>For investors tired of chasing momentum, these five S&amp;P 500 dividend stocks offer something simpler: predictable income and durable growth. In an era when volatility still rules, they prove that boring can be beautiful.

            "title": "Seeking Up to 12% Dividend Yield? Analysts Suggest 2 Dividend Stocks Worth Buying",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Passive income is a classic play for investors seeking steady returns, and the traditional way to achieve it is by investing in dividend stocks. While a dividend-heavy strategy is usually considered defensive in nature, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> can face the same headwinds and volatility that buffet markets in general – but they’ll still pay out dividends, and that will always have a salutary effect on total returns.</p>\n<p>The best dividend stocks typically offer one of two key attributes – a strong yield, well above the prevailing rate of inflation, or a reliable payment history stretching back several years. Both are clear indicators of a strong dividend, and right now, we’ve opened up the <a href=\"http://www.tipranks.com\">TipRanks database</a> to look at two such stocks offering high-yield payments – as high as 12% in one case.</p>\n<p>But there’s more to these picks than just juicy payouts. Each carries a Strong Buy consensus from Wall Street’s analysts, reflecting confidence that stretches beyond income potential alone. Let’s dive in and see what makes these high-yield dividend plays worth buying.</p>\n<p><strong>Mach Natural Resources</strong> <strong>(<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mnr/forecast\">MNR</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll start with Mach Natural Resources, a firm that defines itself as an independent company focused on the upstream oil and gas market, working on the acquisition, development, and exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves. Put more specifically, Mach aims at exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, primarily in the Anadarko Basin, a geological formation that spreads across western Oklahoma, southern Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle.</p>\n<p>Mach’s strategy is based on seeking out and acquiring the best holdings for exploration and development. The company optimizes its production through efficient drilling activities in its existing inventory as a hedge against risk. As a further hedge, the company is beginning to expand its operations outside of the Anadarko Basin. In July of this year, Mach announced that it was making a transformative acquisition in the Permian and San Juan Basins, and on September 16 announced that the acquisition had closed.</p>\n<p>The new holdings include oil and gas assets acquired from Sabinal Energy, along with a number of entities owning oil and gas assets managed by IKAV Energy. The total purchase price for these assets came to $1.3 billion and was conducted in cash and stock – and in the Permian, it gives Mach a foothold in one of North America’s richest oil and gas basins.</p>\n<p>This oil and gas operator went public in October of 2023 and has been paying out dividends since the first quarter of 2024. The firm’s most recent dividend declaration was made on August 7, in conjunction with the 2Q25 earnings release, and set the payment at 38 cents per common share. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to $1.52 per common share and gives a forward yield of 12.5%.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Strong financial performance has supported those payouts. In the second quarter, the last reported, Mach generated $289 million in revenue, topping estimates by more than $50 million, and reported $45.98 million in cash available for distribution, directly underpinning its dividend strength.</p>\n<p>Still, investors have shown some hesitation. Mach’s shares have fallen 29% this year, reflecting concerns about execution risk and leverage following the $1.3 billion acquisition, as well as pressure from softer natural gas prices.</p>\n<p>Even so, Northland analyst Jeff Grampp considers the recent decline a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, citing Mach’s robust dividend and appealing valuation as reasons for optimism.</p>\n<p>“We like MNR’s high distribution strategy, which provides robust quarterly distributions to shareholders. Since inception in 2017, MNR has distributed $1.2 billion to its members (through 9/4/25) and the Company has a current yield of ~12% (most recent quarter annualized). Additionally, we estimate a yield over the next four quarters of ~14%. We believe these kinds of distributions are sustainable given the Company’s lower leverage, modest reinvestment rates and track record of disciplined and accretive M&amp;A,” Grampp opined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The analyst goes on to lay out a case for buying in, adding, “MNR currently trades at 4.1x EV/EBITDA (’26) and a 14.6% CAD yield (’26) at benchmark prices of $62.50/$4.00. We believe this is an attractively low valuation for a company with a high return of capital model that helps de-risk investor returns, coupled with a solid&nbsp;balance sheet and lower reinvestment requirements.”</p>\n<p>Taken together, these comments back up Grampp’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the stock, while his $21 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 72%. Add in the dividend yield, and this stock’s one-year return could exceed 84%. (To watch Grampp’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jeff-grampp\">click here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Strong Buy consensus rating on MNR stock is unanimous, based on 5 uniformly positive analyst reviews. The stock is currently trading at $12.18, and its average target price, now at $20.75, implies a 70% gain in store for the year ahead.

            "title": "Piper Sandler Eyes 2 Dividend Stocks Offering Yields as High as 13%",
            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Might now be the time to consider some defensive plays?</p>\n<p>That mindset will naturally lead us down the path to <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/dividend-stocks\">dividend stocks</a> – the classic defensive move. These names tend to be more stable and less volatile than riskier asset classes. Moreover, top-quality dividend stocks boast consistent payouts and attractive yields, offering investors a source of steady income.</p>\n<p>Piper Sandler analyst Crispin Love has been eyeing the segment and has spotted an opportunity in two dividend stocks that just might fit the bill.</p>\n<p>Even better, running both tickers through the <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dashboard\">TipRanks database</a>, we find both are viewed positively by Wall Street analysts. Let’s dig in.</p>\n<p><strong>Annaly Capital (</strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nly/forecast\"><strong>NLY</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n<p>Those seeking dividend stocks with high yields will often turn to REITs (real estate investment trusts), which are known for their steady income streams and requirement to distribute most of their earnings to shareholders. This is the segment Annaly Capital operates in.</p>\n<p>Annaly is a leading mortgage REIT and diversified capital manager based in New York. It mostly invests in mortgage-related assets – including agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency residential loans, commercial mortgage securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other real estate credit instruments.</p>\n<p>Although NLY operates across several segments, its agency MBS portfolio is the main breadwinner. As of the end of Q2, the company held a total portfolio valued at $89.5 billion, with $79.5 billion invested in its highly liquid Agency MBS strategy. This segment accounts for 89% of total assets and 62% of the firm’s allocated capital. Residential Credit accounted for $6.6 billion, while Mortgage Servicing Rights made up $3.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the quarter, the company generated an adj. EPS of $0.73, beating the Street’s forecast by $0.02, and enough to cover its $0.70 dividend. The last payment was declared on September 10 and will be paid out on October 31. NLY’s dividend offers a 13.6% yield, far above the sector average of 3.3%.</p>\n<p>The robust dividend forms part of Crispin Love’s investment thesis here. The Piper Sandler analyst writes: “The environment has changed dramatically in recent months given the start of the Fed rate cutting cycle as well as significant agency spread tightening and GSE reform commentary. We expect the forward return outlook as well as the potential for GSE reform to be popular topics on the earnings call. We remain Overweight on Annaly given its diversified model that can perform in numerous environments, its solid dividend, and attractive valuation.”</p>\n<p>That Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating is backed by a $22.50 price target, suggesting the stock will gain ~8% over the coming months. Add in the dividend, and investors could be pocketing returns of more than 20%. (To watch Love’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/crispin-love\">click here</a>) </p>\n<p>Turning to the general Street view, NLY stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 5 Buys vs. 2 Holds. At $21.57, the average target factors in a one-year gain of ~4%. (See <strong><a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nly/forecast\">NLY stock forecast</a></strong>)</p>\n<p></p>",

These expenses surged across both Medicare Advantage and commercial plans, prompting UnitedHealth to reevaluate its pricing and benefit structures.</p>\n<p>The company now expects $6.5 billion in additional medical costs this year, with ripple effects likely to stretch into 2026. As a result, UnitedHealth is exiting certain Medicare Advantage markets, impacting roughly 600,000 enrollees.

Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tgt/earnings\">adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share</a> beat the consensus estimate of $2.04 per share, but were significantly lower than prior-year period’s figure of $2.57 per share.</p>\n<p>The sales decline was driven by a 1.2% year-over-year drop in merchandise sales, partially offset by a 14.2% increase in non-merchandise sales. Non-merchandise sales include advertising income and profit-sharing from credit card partnerships.</p>\n<p>Comparable sales fell 1.9% compared to Q2 FY24, reflecting a 3.2% decline in comparable store sales, which was partially offset by a 4.3% increase in digital sales.</p>\n<p>Target had anticipated higher markdowns and tariff-related costs would weigh on margins. However, disciplined cost management helped offset some of the pressure. Meanwhile, Target continues to pay a quarterly <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tgt/dividends\">dividend of $1.14 per share</a>, reflecting an above-industry average current yield of 4.29%.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Target Maintains Fiscal Year 2025 Outlook</strong></h2>\n<p>Interestingly, Target did not revise down its full-year fiscal 2025 guidance despite <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/news/several-missteps-since-the-peak-of-covid-target-stock-nysetgt-gains-as-competitors-close-in\">ongoing challenges, including weak merchandise trends</a>, staffing difficulties, and softer in-store traffic. The company reiterated its forecast for a low single-digit sales decline in FY25 and projected adjusted earnings between $7.00 and $9.00 per share. For comparison, Wall Street estimates a 1.5% decline in FY25 sales and adjusted EPS of $7.28.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Cornell stated, “As we enter the critical back-to-school and holiday seasons, our team remains focused on consistent execution and building momentum as we look ahead to the new year.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is TGT Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?</strong></h2>\n<p>On TipRanks, TGT stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 12 Buys, 16 Holds, and four Sell ratings. The <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tgt/forecast\">average Target price target of $103.40</a> implies 1.9% downside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, TGT stock has lost 19.6%.</p>\n<p>Please note that these ratings were issued before the Q2 results and may change once analysts revisit them.</p>",
