The change follows the earlier rejection of Baker Tilly’s reappointment and strong opposition from controlling shareholder Fullshare, which questioned the validity of HLB Hodgson’s appointment and prefers Prism, prompting the board and audit committee to act to reduce legal and governance risks, even as some directors and committee members dissent.</p>\n<p>The company warns that if HLB Hodgson’s appointment were ultimately deemed invalid, any audit report it issued on the 2025 financial statements could also be invalid, potentially exposing all shareholders to significant risk. HLB Hodgson has refused to resign or provide a clearance letter, so the board is relying on a formal removal process under Hong Kong listing rules, a step that underscores internal tensions and raises near‑term uncertainty over the timing and integrity of the group’s audited results.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0658\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0658\">(HK:0658)</a> stock is a Sell with a HK$1.50 price target.
