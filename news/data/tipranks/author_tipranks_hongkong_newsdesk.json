As part of this process, Rizhao Shihua will sell certain operating assets and related facilities to independent third parties for about RMB2.41 billion, with the price based on an independent valuation and subject to state-owned asset supervision rules.</p>\n<p>The board cites operational uncertainties at Rizhao Shihua as the reason for the move, arguing that liquidation and asset disposal will better protect the interests of the company and its shareholders. The group expects to recover cash roughly equal to the carrying value of its investment but, due to reclassification of cumulative foreign currency translation losses, anticipates recognizing an unaudited loss of around HK$127 million in 2026 when the liquidation and deregistration are completed, and has warned investors to exercise caution in trading its shares.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0934\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0934\">(HK:0934)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$4.50 price target.
