The Group nevertheless swung to a profit of RM0.7 million from a RM6.8 million loss, driven primarily by a RM6.8 million gain on disposal of land, a net reversal of expected credit loss provisions, and improved other comprehensive income from favourable foreign exchange translation effects.</p>\n<p>Administrative expenses remained broadly flat, and finance costs rose sharply, weighing on underlying profitability and highlighting higher funding costs during the period. Overall comprehensive income turned positive at RM0.9 million, with profits attributable to owners of the Company at RM1.0 million, signalling a notable improvement in shareholder returns, although the reliance on one-off land disposal gains suggests that the sustainability of this turnaround will depend on strengthening core operating margins and managing rising financing expenses.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1960\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1960\">(HK:1960)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$0.20 price target.

The deal, which will be settled based on an equity consideration adjusted for locked-box compensation and leakage, is expected to significantly enlarge the group once completed, pending shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting.</p>\n<p>Because the highest applicable percentage ratio for the acquisition, alone or together with a related subscription, exceeds 100 percent, the transaction triggers reporting, circular and shareholder approval requirements under Chapter 14 of the listing rules. The company plans to dispatch a detailed circular, including pro forma financial information on the enlarged group, to shareholders by 30 June 2026, with the EGM expected on or before 24 July 2026.</p>\n<p>The board has stated that, to its best knowledge, no existing shareholder has a material interest in the acquisition or the subscription, so no shareholder is currently required to abstain from voting on the relevant resolutions at the EGM. Trading in EuroEyes shares, which was halted on 23 February 2026 pending this announcement, is set to resume on 27 February 2026, though completion of the acquisition remains subject to satisfaction or waiver of conditions precedent, prompting a cautionary note to investors.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1846\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1846\">(HK:1846)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$3.00 price target.

The change follows the earlier rejection of Baker Tilly’s reappointment and strong opposition from controlling shareholder Fullshare, which questioned the validity of HLB Hodgson’s appointment and prefers Prism, prompting the board and audit committee to act to reduce legal and governance risks, even as some directors and committee members dissent.</p>\n<p>The company warns that if HLB Hodgson’s appointment were ultimately deemed invalid, any audit report it issued on the 2025 financial statements could also be invalid, potentially exposing all shareholders to significant risk. HLB Hodgson has refused to resign or provide a clearance letter, so the board is relying on a formal removal process under Hong Kong listing rules, a step that underscores internal tensions and raises near‑term uncertainty over the timing and integrity of the group’s audited results.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0658\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0658\">(HK:0658)</a> stock is a Sell with a HK$1.50 price target.

The board attributes this reversal mainly to a HK$39 million expected credit loss allowance on rental deposits, as well as the absence of several sizeable one-off gains booked in the prior comparable period.</p>\n<p>Those non-recurring gains in the earlier period included the net impact of lease termination and investment property derecognition, plus a gain on bargain purchase, which together had boosted 6M2024 results but will not recur in 6M2025. The company is still finalising its interim results and has cautioned shareholders and potential investors that the figures are based on unaudited management accounts and may be adjusted, urging them to exercise care when dealing in its shares ahead of the formal results announcement due by end-February 2026.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0565\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0565\">(HK:0565)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$2.00 price target.
