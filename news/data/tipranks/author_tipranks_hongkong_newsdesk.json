Shenzhen Investment further clarifies that any compensation payable by Shum Yip Pengji under the performance compensation arrangement will be capped at the total consideration it receives from the disposal, limiting the group’s financial exposure under the profit guarantee.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0604\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0604\">(HK:0604)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$0.83 price target.

The Group nevertheless swung to a profit of RM0.7 million from a RM6.8 million loss, driven primarily by a RM6.8 million gain on disposal of land, a net reversal of expected credit loss provisions, and improved other comprehensive income from favourable foreign exchange translation effects.</p>\n<p>Administrative expenses remained broadly flat, and finance costs rose sharply, weighing on underlying profitability and highlighting higher funding costs during the period. Overall comprehensive income turned positive at RM0.9 million, with profits attributable to owners of the Company at RM1.0 million, signalling a notable improvement in shareholder returns, although the reliance on one-off land disposal gains suggests that the sustainability of this turnaround will depend on strengthening core operating margins and managing rising financing expenses.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1960\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1960\">(HK:1960)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$0.20 price target.
