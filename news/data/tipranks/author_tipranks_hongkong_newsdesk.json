Ltd. to ThaiNamthip Corporation Public Company Limited. The original conditional transaction agreement for the Vietnam unit was terminated, and instead a share purchase agreement was executed under which ThaiNamthip’s subsidiary, ThaiNamthip Holdings Limited, acquired 30% of Coca-Cola Indochina for about US$221.1 million in cash.</p>\n<p>Following completion and registration, ThaiNamthip now indirectly holds 30% of the Vietnamese bottler through its stake in Coca-Cola Indochina, whose primary asset is the Vietnam subsidiary, meaning both Coca-Cola Indochina and the Vietnam bottling business have become non-wholly owned subsidiaries of Swire Pacific. The company noted that this revised structure, driven by ThaiNamthip’s desire to streamline its investment holdings, constitutes a material variation of a previously disclosed transaction under Hong Kong listing rules, but the new share purchase itself is not a notifiable or connected transaction, limiting additional regulatory implications for shareholders.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0019\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0019\">(HK:0019)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$81.00 price target.

Class H ( <a data-ticker=\"HK:6166\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:6166\">(HK:6166)</a> ) just unveiled an update.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p>CIG Shanghai’s key subsidiary CIG Zhejiang Telecommunication Equipment has entered into a long‑term lease with Jiashan Zhongxin Industrial Development Investment for an industrial, office, and warehousing facility in Jiashan, Zhejiang, covering about 88,815 square meters. The lease runs from April 1, 2026 to December 31, 2035, with the occupied area from 2031 determined by actual use by the lessee.</p>\n<p>Because Jiashan Zhongxin holds around 33.33% of CIG Zhejiang, the arrangement is classified as a connected transaction under Hong Kong listing rules, requiring disclosure but no independent shareholder approval. The group will recognize right‑of‑use assets of about RMB63.8 million for this one‑off connected lease, signaling a sizable, long‑term commitment to production and logistics capacity while keeping regulatory compliance obligations relatively light.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:6166\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:6166\">(HK:6166)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$86.00 price target.
