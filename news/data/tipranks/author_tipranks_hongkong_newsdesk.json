Despite this top-line growth, earnings are set to weaken, with net profit forecast to fall by about half as losses on Au(T+D) contracts and gold loans surge amid rising gold prices, partially offset only as higher market prices feed through into product sales.</p>\n<p>The company explained that hedging-related losses are recognized immediately, while gains from higher gold prices are realized later through sales and inventory revaluation, leading to a temporary profit drag even as revenues rise. After posting a loss in the first half of 2025, Mokingran expects to end the full year with a modest profit and says it will tighten internal controls over its Au(T+D) and gold loan strategies while adjusting its sales approach to better manage commodity price volatility and protect shareholder interests.</p>\n<p><b><u>More about Mokingran Jewellery Group Co Ltd Class H</u></b></p>\n<p>Mokingran Jewellery Group Co., Ltd. is a China-based gold and jewellery company listed in Hong Kong, focusing on the design, production and sale of gold jewellery and related products.

The original conditional transaction agreement for the Vietnam unit was terminated, and instead a share purchase agreement was executed under which ThaiNamthip’s subsidiary, ThaiNamthip Holdings Limited, acquired 30% of Coca-Cola Indochina for about US$221.1 million in cash.</p>\n<p>Following completion and registration, ThaiNamthip now indirectly holds 30% of the Vietnamese bottler through its stake in Coca-Cola Indochina, whose primary asset is the Vietnam subsidiary, meaning both Coca-Cola Indochina and the Vietnam bottling business have become non-wholly owned subsidiaries of Swire Pacific. The company noted that this revised structure, driven by ThaiNamthip’s desire to streamline its investment holdings, constitutes a material variation of a previously disclosed transaction under Hong Kong listing rules, but the new share purchase itself is not a notifiable or connected transaction, limiting additional regulatory implications for shareholders.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0019\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0019\">(HK:0019)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$81.00 price target.

As part of this process, Rizhao Shihua will sell certain operating assets and related facilities to independent third parties for about RMB2.41 billion, with the price based on an independent valuation and subject to state-owned asset supervision rules.</p>\n<p>The board cites operational uncertainties at Rizhao Shihua as the reason for the move, arguing that liquidation and asset disposal will better protect the interests of the company and its shareholders. The group expects to recover cash roughly equal to the carrying value of its investment but, due to reclassification of cumulative foreign currency translation losses, anticipates recognizing an unaudited loss of around HK$127 million in 2026 when the liquidation and deregistration are completed, and has warned investors to exercise caution in trading its shares.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0934\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0934\">(HK:0934)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$4.50 price target.
