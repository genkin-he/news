The Group nevertheless swung to a profit of RM0.7 million from a RM6.8 million loss, driven primarily by a RM6.8 million gain on disposal of land, a net reversal of expected credit loss provisions, and improved other comprehensive income from favourable foreign exchange translation effects.</p>\n<p>Administrative expenses remained broadly flat, and finance costs rose sharply, weighing on underlying profitability and highlighting higher funding costs during the period. Overall comprehensive income turned positive at RM0.9 million, with profits attributable to owners of the Company at RM1.0 million, signalling a notable improvement in shareholder returns, although the reliance on one-off land disposal gains suggests that the sustainability of this turnaround will depend on strengthening core operating margins and managing rising financing expenses.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1960\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1960\">(HK:1960)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$0.20 price target.

The deal, which will be settled based on an equity consideration adjusted for locked-box compensation and leakage, is expected to significantly enlarge the group once completed, pending shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting.</p>\n<p>Because the highest applicable percentage ratio for the acquisition, alone or together with a related subscription, exceeds 100 percent, the transaction triggers reporting, circular and shareholder approval requirements under Chapter 14 of the listing rules. The company plans to dispatch a detailed circular, including pro forma financial information on the enlarged group, to shareholders by 30 June 2026, with the EGM expected on or before 24 July 2026.</p>\n<p>The board has stated that, to its best knowledge, no existing shareholder has a material interest in the acquisition or the subscription, so no shareholder is currently required to abstain from voting on the relevant resolutions at the EGM. Trading in EuroEyes shares, which was halted on 23 February 2026 pending this announcement, is set to resume on 27 February 2026, though completion of the acquisition remains subject to satisfaction or waiver of conditions precedent, prompting a cautionary note to investors.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1846\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1846\">(HK:1846)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$3.00 price target.

The deal, executed through a share purchase agreement, will see CKI, PAH and CKA divest their respective 40%, 40% and 20% interests, including associated shareholder debt instruments.</p>\n<p>The disposal is intended to monetise a long‑held UK infrastructure investment at what CKI’s board considers an attractive valuation, crystallising significant accounting gains and freeing cash for future investments or acquisitions. The transaction is classified as a major and connected transaction for CKI and a discloseable and connected transaction for CK Hutchison under Hong Kong listing rules, requiring announcements, circulars and independent shareholders’ approvals, and it remains subject to conditions, meaning completion is not yet guaranteed.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:0001\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0001\">(HK:0001)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$67.00 price target.
