Pricing, including size, offer price and coupon, will be set via a bookbuilding led by Citigroup Global Markets and Haitong International Securities as joint global coordinators and bookrunners.</p>\n<p>The issuer and Seazen intend to use net proceeds to fund a concurrent 2026 offer to purchase, refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes, as part of ongoing balance-sheet management. The notes have received in-principle approval for listing on the Singapore Exchange, though no Hong Kong listing is sought, and the company cautioned that no binding agreement has yet been signed so the deal may not proceed.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1030\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1030\">(HK:1030)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$2.50 price target.

For CK Hutchison, the deal is treated as a discloseable and connected transaction, requiring disclosure and independent approval, while completion remains conditional on agreed terms, meaning the sale may not ultimately proceed and investors are urged to exercise caution.</p>\n<p>The most recent analyst rating on <a data-ticker=\"HK:1038\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:1038\">(HK:1038)</a> stock is a Hold with a HK$70.00 price target.
