The transaction adds roughly 800MW of installed and development capacity, enhancing the company’s ability to serve rising demand for large-scale, infrastructure‑intensive workloads.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, Klein notes that the atNorth deal is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted funds from operations, supported by an attractive valuation multiple and a robust $4.2B financing package. He also highlights the strong improvement in atNorth’s contracted EBITDA over the past four years and the additional fee income Equinix will earn from its joint‑venture structure, all of which support the positive risk‑reward profile for EQIX shares.</p>\n<p>In another report released on February 25, Evercore ISI also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $1,060.00 price target.</p>",

He notes that the stock had strongly outperformed while peers like SHLS, EOSE, and ARRY sold off on weak earnings, and reads the sharp decline as a “sell-the-winners” catch-up move and retail unwinding, rather than a reaction to any company-specific negative development.</p>\n<p>Milligan also emphasizes that the commentary around FSLR’s intellectual property is unlikely to be the direct cause of the move, reinforcing his view that fundamentals remain intact. Looking ahead, he highlights upcoming catalysts including late-March earnings, progress on G2 Phase 1 financing that could improve balance-sheet flexibility, and additional G2 offtake visibility, concluding that successful execution on these items represents meaningful upside and makes current weakness an attractive entry point.\n</p>\n<p>Milligan covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as First Solar, Shoals Technologies Group, and Nextpower Inc. According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:blue\">TipRanks</a>, Milligan has an average return of <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold;\">-1.0%</span> and a 58.33% success rate on recommended stocks. </p>\n<p></p>",

She highlights that updated Phase 2b data show notably higher response rates in biomarker-selected and broader serous EC patients with limited prior therapy, alongside a safety profile largely confined to manageable, on-target hematologic effects without the gastrointestinal or neurologic toxicities often seen with other treatments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She also points to strong enthusiasm from key opinion leaders, who view ACR-368 as a precision therapy with response rates that substantially exceed typical outcomes with current chemotherapy or post-immunotherapy options in this high‑mortality subset. In her view, the simplified, biopsy‑free Arm 3 design, ongoing U.S. and European enrollment, clear FDA alignment on the single‑arm registrational path, and the mechanistic rationale in HR‑deficient, p53‑mutated serous EC collectively support the potential for accelerated approval and meaningful upside for ACRV shares.</p>\n<p></p>",

The company delivered first-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations, raised its full-year outlook, and continues to benefit from a resilient commercial aftermarket and a gradually improving OEM production environment, despite some lumpiness and slower organic growth.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the 10% share-price pullback following the print appears disproportionate to the modest deceleration in aftermarket growth and the EPS decline, which was largely driven by mix and higher interest expense rather than a deterioration in the core business.

He notes that revenue came in slightly better than what was initially signaled and ahead of market expectations, while free cash flow turned positive and exceeded the earlier pre-announced range, indicating meaningful improvement in cash utilization.</p>\n<p>He also emphasizes that management reaffirmed its 2026 outlook, which he views as achievable and potentially conservative given ongoing strength in core product lines and upcoming launches. Coupled with what he sees as an undemanding valuation and the transition to a free cash flow neutral or positive profile, he concludes that the shares have attractive upside potential relative to current levels.\n</p>\n<p>In another report released today, Needham also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $30.00 price target.</p>",
