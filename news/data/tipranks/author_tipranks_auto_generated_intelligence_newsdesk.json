            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>John Blackledge has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors including Amazon’s strong financial performance and growth prospects. In the third quarter of 2025, Amazon’s revenue and operating income exceeded expectations, with revenue growing by 1% more than consensus estimates and operating income beating by 10.1% when excluding certain charges. Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed significant acceleration, with revenue increasing by 20.2% year-over-year, driven by core and <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> workloads, and a growing backlog. <br> Additionally, Amazon’s advertising segment also experienced robust growth, contributing to the overall revenue beat. Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025 suggests continued strength, with revenue and operating income projections surpassing consensus estimates at the high end. The company’s capital expenditure plans and infrastructure expansion further support its growth trajectory, reinforcing Blackledge’s positive outlook and Buy rating for Amazon’s stock.</p>\n<p>Blackledge covers the Communication Services sector, focusing on stocks such as Alphabet Class C, Meta Platforms, and Netflix. According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:blue\">TipRanks</a>, Blackledge has an average return of <span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold;\">12.5%</span> and a 56.30% success rate on recommended stocks. </p>\n<p>In another report released today, Citizens JMP also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $300.00 price target.</p>",
