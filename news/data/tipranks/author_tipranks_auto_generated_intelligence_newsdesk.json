The company has reported increasing sales across its business segments, which is expected to lead to higher sales and earnings in 2025, surpassing initial earnings estimates. This growth trajectory is particularly supported by the stability in its packaging segment and a fully booked aerospace segment.<br>Additionally, Trimas reported third-quarter sales that exceeded expectations, reinforcing confidence in its earnings growth potential. The company’s stock has been consistently trading around the $38 mark, and the recent financial results indicate a strong position to not only grow earnings but also reduce its debt. These factors collectively underpin Khorsand’s optimistic Buy rating for TRS with a target price of $45 over the next 12 months.</p>\n<p></p>",

Despite a conservative estimate of organic growth at around 5% for 2026, which is lower than the previous 10% expectation, the company’s management has demonstrated a strong commitment to cost control. This focus on cost management has resulted in an EBITDA estimate that is slightly higher than previous models, suggesting that Cognex can achieve favorable financial outcomes even with modest growth.<br>Furthermore, there are positive indicators in Cognex’s end markets, such as increasing warehouse construction and a potential acceleration in the <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks\">semiconductor</a> sector, which could provide upside risks to the current model. While Cognex needs to substantiate its growth narrative, the ability to deliver results without relying heavily on end-market conditions could indicate a more sustainable business model.
