The adoption of a more flexible approach to net debt targets also positions the company well for future opportunistic share repurchases. These strategic moves, combined with a favorable valuation outlook, underpin the Buy rating, even as the target price was slightly adjusted to reflect current financial leverage.</p>\n<p></p>",

The company recently hosted an R&amp;D event that showcased their proprietary technologies aimed at addressing challenges in respiratory and vascular diseases. A key focus was on Yutrepia, which has demonstrated improved tolerability compared to existing treatments, allowing for higher dosing levels that are linked to better patient outcomes. This has broadened the role of inhaled prostacyclin in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.<br>Additionally, Liquidia introduced their L606 program, which is set to begin a pivotal Phase 3 trial. The L606 program involves a liposomal formulation of treprostinil, offering consistent exposure levels with minimal variations, and has shown promising results in early trials. The upcoming trial aims to support regulatory approval, further enhancing the company’s pipeline. These factors, combined with the anticipated growth in Yutrepia’s sales and an impending patent litigation decision, contribute to Belanger’s optimistic Buy rating for the stock.</p>\n<p>In another report released today, H.C. Wainwright also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $35.00 price target.</p>\n<p></p>",

While there is an increase in the revenue estimate for the fiscal year 2026, primarily due to improved float revenue, the projections for subsequent years have been adjusted downward for both the Employer Services (ES) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) segments. <br> This adjustment leads to a slight increase in the earnings per share (EPS) estimate for 2026, but the EPS estimates for the following years are modestly reduced. Consequently, the price target is set at $263, reflecting a cautious outlook on the stock’s future performance.
