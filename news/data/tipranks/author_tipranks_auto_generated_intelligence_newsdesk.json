            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>James Thalacker’s rating is based on Nisource’s promising growth outlook and strategic initiatives. The company has reaffirmed its full-year guidance and introduced a positive earnings outlook for 2026, projecting a significant year-over-year increase. This growth is supported by a comprehensive five-year capital plan, which includes substantial investments in their GenCo segment, expected to drive earnings and rate base growth through 2033.<br>Additionally, the involvement of Blackstone with a minority interest in GenCo provides a strong financial backing, enhancing Nisource’s equity position. Despite initial market reactions, Thalacker views the company’s ability to convert data center opportunities into incremental earnings as a key differentiator. The above-average EPS growth and strategic investments position Nisource as a top pick in its sector, justifying the Buy rating.</p>\n<p>In another report released yesterday, Bank of America Securities also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $47.00 price target.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Daniel Jester’s rating is based on a combination of factors including the recent performance and anticipated future developments for Dayforce Inc. The company’s latest quarterly results showed a slight shortfall in key revenue areas, with growth at approximately 14%, which was below expectations due to declining employment levels among its customer base. This trend mirrors broader employment challenges seen in the industry, as indicated by similar patterns at ADP.<br>Despite these challenges, Dayforce’s total revenue growth was largely in line with projections, and the company managed to slightly exceed EBITDA expectations. However, the upside was limited compared to the trailing twelve-month average. Given these mixed results and the upcoming acquisition by Thoma Bravo, which is expected to close by early 2026, Jester maintains a cautious outlook. The Hold rating reflects the unchanged growth and margin assumptions for the coming quarters, with risks skewed towards the downside due to ongoing labor market uncertainties.</p>\n<p>Jester covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Workday, Workiva, and Dayforce Inc.

Despite weaker power prices in Alberta, the company’s significant exposure to U.S. gas power assets is proving advantageous, with these assets outperforming expectations in terms of utilization, pricing, and contract renewals. This positive performance in the U.S. market is expected to more than compensate for the challenges faced in Alberta, as evidenced by a 40% year-over-year increase in U.S. Flexible Generation earnings.<br>Furthermore, the company’s shares are considered undervalued, trading at approximately 10 times EBITDA, which is below the broader industry average. The outlook for Alberta’s power market is also improving, with forward prices and potential developments like the Genesee DC optionality being viewed positively by the market. Additionally, Capital Power’s ongoing projects and future opportunities, such as the 250MW DC opportunity at MCV and further U.S. gas power value realization, support a favorable long-term growth trajectory. These factors collectively underpin Pham’s decision to maintain an Outperform rating and a target price of $79.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:blue\">TipRanks</a>, Pham is a 5-star analyst with an average return of <span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold;\">9.3%</span> and a 67.67% success rate.
