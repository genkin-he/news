            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Thibault Boutherin has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Novartis AG’s potential for future growth. Despite a recent decline in stock value following a Q3’25 sales and earnings miss, Boutherin emphasizes that the setback is largely due to temporary issues with certain products losing exclusivity, while key growth drivers have exceeded expectations. This shift in product mix is expected to enhance the quality of growth in the mid-term, with Boutherin’s forecasts for these growth drivers being significantly above consensus.<br>Furthermore, Boutherin points to the upcoming launch of Rhapsido (remibrutinib) as a pivotal factor in Novartis’s growth story, projecting substantial revenue potential across various indications. The analyst also notes that while growth in 2026 might be modest, there is an anticipated acceleration from 2027 onwards, supported by strategic pipeline execution and potential mergers and acquisitions. This outlook is further bolstered by an expected positive update at the upcoming Capital Markets Day, framing a favorable long-term growth trajectory for Novartis.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 29, Deutsche Bank  also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a CHF120.00 price target.</p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Andy Hsieh’s rating is based on the anticipation of upcoming data from a Phase II trial involving FibroGen’s FG-3246 in combination with Xtandi for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. While the treatment landscape for this condition is becoming more competitive, particularly due to the success of Pluvicto, the potential synergy between FG-3246 and Xtandi is intriguing. The previous Phase Ib study suggested that Xtandi might enhance the expression of CD46, thereby increasing the effectiveness of FG-3246.<br>Despite the promising mechanism, the expectations for the upcoming trial data are tempered by the heavily pretreated nature of the patient population. The anticipated outcomes are expected to mirror the Phase Ib results, with a modest PSA reduction and a median progression-free survival of about 10 months. Additionally, FG-3246 is being evaluated as a standalone treatment in a separate Phase II study, with interim results expected next year. These factors contribute to the Hold rating, as the potential benefits are balanced by the uncertainties and competitive pressures in the market.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 28, TR | OpenAI – 4o also reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $11.00 price target.</p>\n<p></p>",
