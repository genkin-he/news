            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Stephen Gengaro has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight both challenges and opportunities for Generac Holdings. Despite weaker-than-expected power outage activity impacting the company’s third-quarter results and leading to a reduction in 2025 guidance, there are positive indicators for future growth. The company’s data center backlog has doubled to $300 million over the past three months, suggesting potential for continued expansion in this segment.<br>Additionally, Generac’s energy technology solutions have exceeded expectations, driven by strong shipments of energy storage systems, particularly in Puerto Rico. The increase in dealer count further supports a higher baseline level of demand for home standby generators. While 2025 revenue is expected to remain flat year-over-year due to reduced outage activity, the company’s strategic initiatives and growth in commercial and industrial segments, especially in data centers, are promising. These factors, combined with a maintained target price of $210, underpin Gengaro’s Buy recommendation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>GNRC’s price has also changed dramatically  for the past six months – from $113.240 to $180.860, which is a 59.71% increase.</p>",

He views Carvana as a leading large-cap growth story, with a clear and extended growth trajectory that stands out compared to its peers. The company’s ability to maintain consistent performance and provide long-term guidance demonstrates the strength of its business model.<br>Furthermore, Chris Pierce believes that Carvana deserves a valuation similar to other dominant players in large total addressable markets, such as streaming or food delivery services. The $500 price target is based on Carvana achieving significant retail unit sales with healthy margins by 2033, reflecting confidence in the company’s strategic direction and market position.</p>\n<p></p>",

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>John Blackledge’s rating is based on a combination of factors, including eBay’s solid third-quarter performance, where revenue, gross merchandise volume (GMV), and earnings per share exceeded expectations. The growth was primarily driven by the company’s Focus Categories, particularly Collectibles, which saw significant year-over-year growth. However, despite these positive results, the guidance for the fourth-quarter operating income margin was slightly below estimates due to reinvestments and other headwinds.<br>While eBay’s strategic initiatives and strong performance in Focus Categories and U.S. sales are promising, the anticipated margin pressures from factors such as changes in depreciation schedules, managed shipping costs, and M&amp;A-related expenses present challenges. These considerations led to maintaining a Hold rating, with the price target remaining unchanged at $84, as the stock’s potential upside appears limited given the current market conditions and operational challenges.</p>\n<p>Blackledge covers the Communication Services sector, focusing on stocks such as Alphabet Class C, Meta Platforms, and Netflix.
