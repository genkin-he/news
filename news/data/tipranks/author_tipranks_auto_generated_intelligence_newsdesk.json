The company’s recent earnings report highlighted strong growth in bookings, revenue, and daily active users, which management believes will continue to scale over the long term. This optimism is supported by the sustained momentum in the growth of creators and developers, which is expected to expand the variety of content available to users.<br>Despite some disappointment in the Q4 and initial 2026 adjusted EBITDA margin commentary, which fell short of expectations, the company’s strategic investments are seen as a positive move for future growth. The ongoing scaling of Roblox’s discovery capabilities is also a key factor in the Buy rating, as it suggests a robust platform that can drive long-term revenue compounding and margin improvement.</p>\n<p>In another report released yesterday, Raymond James also downgraded the stock to a Buy with a $165.00 price target.</p>\n<p></p>",

The company recently held a Type A meeting with the FDA to address a complete response letter for its drug, oxylanthanum carbonate (OLC), used in treating hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease. The meeting focused on resolving a single deficiency related to a third-party vendor, with no concerns about the drug’s preclinical, clinical, or safety data. This progress positions Unicycive to refile by the end of 2025, potentially leading to a PDUFA date in the first half of 2026.<br> Additionally, Unicycive’s strong cash position of $42 million as of the third quarter of 2025 provides financial stability through 2027, supporting its development efforts. The company’s Phase 2 study of OLC showed significant improvements in patient adherence and satisfaction, with a reduced pill burden and better tolerability compared to existing treatments. These positive clinical outcomes, combined with a strategic financial plan and a clear regulatory path, underpin McCarthy’s optimistic outlook and Buy rating for Unicycive’s stock.</p>\n<p>In another report released yesterday, Benchmark Co. also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $21.00 price target.</p>",
