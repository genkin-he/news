The company’s third-quarter results exceeded expectations, with adjusted diluted EPS and total revenue surpassing both the firm’s and consensus estimates. This positive performance was primarily driven by the impressive year-over-year growth of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which offset the decline in Humira sales.<br>Additionally, AbbVie’s neuroscience franchise, particularly Botox Therapeutic, showed robust growth, further contributing to the company’s revenue. Despite challenges in the aesthetics franchise, management’s decision to raise the full-year 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance indicates confidence in future earnings. The continued success of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, along with potential growth from the Parkinson’s disease franchise, positions AbbVie well for sustained growth, justifying the Buy rating.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 28, Piper Sandler also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $284.00 price target.</p>",

Despite the current volatility and challenges posed by the government shutdown, the company is poised for growth as it moves into fiscal 2026. The absence of further federal contract cancellations in the third quarter and a strategic shift towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses such as commercial energy are promising signs.<br>Additionally, while the third-quarter results were below expectations due to a decline in federal revenue, much of this revenue is expected to be deferred rather than lost, potentially boosting future performance. The IT modernization business is also anticipated to gain momentum in mid to late 2026. These factors, combined with the expectation of revenue and EPS growth in fiscal 2026, make any current weakness in shares an attractive buying opportunity for investors with a longer-term perspective.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 28, Barrington also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $107.00 price target.</p>",
