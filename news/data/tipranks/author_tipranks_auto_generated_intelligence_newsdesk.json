Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025 suggests continued strength, with revenue and operating income projections surpassing consensus estimates at the high end.

The company’s third-quarter performance exceeded expectations, yet there is caution surrounding the fourth quarter due to a slower start and challenging comparisons. While tariffs are expected to begin affecting the financials in the fourth quarter, Floor &amp; Decor is anticipated to manage these through modest price increases, minimizing risks to gross margins.<br>Despite the positive product margin growth driven by supply chain efficiencies and operational improvements, there are concerns about future sales performance. The company faces variability in comparable store sales across different regions, with some areas showing strength while others lag. Additionally, while the store opening plans for fiscal year 2026 appear stable, there is limited visibility for significant growth in 2027, as management needs to see a consistent improvement in comparable sales before expanding further.

The company has shown solid performance in the third quarter with a 3% increase in comparable sales, but the outlook for the fourth quarter appears uncertain due to consumer weakness and softer transaction trends. There is a cautious approach towards the company’s ability to gain market share, particularly in the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segment, where transaction growth is lagging behind competitors.<br>Additionally, while there are ongoing efforts to improve margins, the trajectory remains unclear. The expectation for core EBIT margin expansion has been modestly delayed, and while there are potential upsides for fiscal year 2027 if management executes their plans effectively, there are headwinds such as capitalized inventory costs that could impact next year’s performance.
