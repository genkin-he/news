This performance was achieved despite a challenging retail environment and included a notable revenue increase in international markets, particularly in China and the EMEA region.<br>Columbia’s ability to maintain healthy inventory levels and the positive reception of its new product lines, such as the Amaze Puff women’s jacket and the Limited Edition Bugaboot 1, further support the Buy rating. Additionally, the company is implementing selective price increases to navigate <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/stocks-hurt-by-trump-tariffs\">tariff</a> challenges, which is expected to bolster future sales growth. The valuation of Columbia’s stock, with a price target of $75 based on a P/E multiple of 23x FY26 EPS estimates, reflects confidence in the brand’s potential to drive growth through its brand refresh and strategic market positioning.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 22, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/firms/stifel-nicolaus\">Stifel Nicolaus</a> also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $68.00 price target.</p>",
