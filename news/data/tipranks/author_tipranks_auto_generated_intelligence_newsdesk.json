            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Jeff Schmitt’s rating is based on a combination of factors influencing Cboe Global Markets’ current and future performance. The company reported strong third-quarter results with adjusted EPS surpassing expectations due to robust revenue and expense management. Growth was observed across various business segments, notably in derivatives and cash markets, driven by increased volumes and market share, particularly in Europe. Additionally, the company is strategically refocusing on high-growth areas by exiting noncore markets, which is expected to positively impact EPS.<br>However, Schmitt notes that sustaining this momentum could be challenging due to tough comparisons, especially in derivatives and European markets. He anticipates a slowdown in derivatives growth to midsingle digits by 2026, which is significant given that derivatives constitute half of Cboe’s business mix. Consequently, EPS growth is projected to decline to 4% in 2026. Furthermore, the stock’s valuation at 23 times 2026 EPS, compared to a historical average of 22 times, suggests limited upside potential, justifying the Hold rating.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:blue\">TipRanks</a>, Schmitt is a 3-star analyst with an average return of <span style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold;\">5.7%</span> and a 60.00% success rate.

            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Richard Newitter has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors including Stryker’s mixed financial performance and valuation considerations. The company reported a slight revenue beat with mixed quality earnings, where certain segments like MedSurg and Neurotechnology underperformed, while others like Orthopedics showed strength. Despite a positive earnings per share (EPS) beat, it was largely driven by non-operational items such as tax benefits, rather than core operational improvements.<br>Additionally, Newitter adjusted the price target to $392 from $407, reflecting a forward valuation that is at a premium to the S&amp;P 500, but below Stryker’s historical average premium. This premium is justified by Stryker’s high-quality, above-average revenue growth. However, for a more favorable rating, Newitter would require greater confidence in the company’s potential for faster EPS growth. The impact of tariffs and other external factors also contribute to the cautious outlook, suggesting that while there are positive elements, uncertainties remain that warrant a Hold rating.</p>\n<p></p>",
