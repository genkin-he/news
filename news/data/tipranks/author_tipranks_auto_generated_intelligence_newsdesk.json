MSTR has successfully increased its bitcoin holdings by 5.2% sequentially in the third quarter of 2025, demonstrating effective treasury operations. The company raised a substantial $5.1 billion to purchase approximately 43,000 bitcoins, utilizing both common and preferred stock sales, which indicates a strong commitment to leveraging its financial resources for bitcoin accumulation.<br>Additionally, MSTR’s software business has shown significant growth, with a 10.9% year-over-year increase in revenue and a notable 65.4% rise in cloud revenue, although this segment contributes minimally to the overall valuation. The balance sheet remains strong, backed by substantial digital assets and a strategic shift from convertible debt to perpetual preferred stock, enhancing capital access. Despite lowering the 12-month price target to $425, Galinko maintains a positive outlook on MSTR’s potential, driven by the expected value of its bitcoin holdings and core software business.</p>\n<p>In another report released yesterday, BTIG also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $630.00 price target.</p>\n<p>MSTR’s price has also changed moderately  for the past six months – from $380.110 to $269.510, which is a -29.10% drop .</p>",
