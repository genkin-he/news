            "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Sharon Zackfia’s rating is based on a combination of factors, including BJ’s Restaurants’ performance in the third quarter and its future outlook. Although the company’s adjusted earnings per share slightly exceeded expectations, comparable sales growth was below consensus. This was due to weaker trends in the early part of the quarter, despite a recovery to consistent growth later on.<br>Furthermore, the company has shown positive traffic trends, particularly in the last six weeks, driven by successful marketing strategies and promotions like the Pizookie Meal Deal. However, the overall performance and the anticipated fourth-quarter comparable sales growth, while better than consensus, suggest a cautious stance. This combination of mixed results and future expectations led Sharon Zackfia to maintain a Hold rating on BJ’s Restaurants’ stock.</p>\n<p>In another report released on October 16, Citi also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $38.00 price target.</p>",
