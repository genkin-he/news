The company has demonstrated robust growth, particularly with a 10% increase in global organic mask sales and notable growth in the American market. This growth is attributed to strategic investments in new masks, SaaS platforms, primary care physician education, and home sleep testing, which are expected to continue driving durable growth.<br>Furthermore, Resmed is benefiting from operational efficiencies, such as reduced freight costs and automation, which are contributing to margin expansion. Despite a recent decline in share price, the solid first-quarter results provide confidence in the company’s ability to meet expectations. With shares trading at a reasonable multiple of future earnings estimates, Vazquez anticipates further upside potential through EPS growth and possible valuation expansion.</p>\n<p></p>",

The company has shown resilience against the bear thesis concerning AI’s impact on developer seat reductions, with cloud revenue growth exceeding expectations for the third consecutive quarter. This growth is driven by enterprise expansion, <a data-autolink=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence\">AI</a> adoption, and platform selling, which have positively influenced Atlassian’s financial outlook.<br>Furthermore, Atlassian’s Data Center customers are transitioning to the cloud at a faster pace than anticipated, doubling compared to the previous year, which has led to an increase in full-year revenue guidance. Despite the broader software sector’s concerns about AI risks, Bhatia believes these are overstated and sees Atlassian as well-positioned for continued growth, projecting over 20% growth in the coming years with robust free cash flow generation. The stock’s valuation, despite recent pullbacks, remains attractive, supporting the Buy recommendation.</p>\n<p>In another report released today, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $215.00 price target.</p>\n<p></p>",
