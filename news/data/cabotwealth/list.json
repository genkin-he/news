I think they are ahead of the curve in understanding the need to invest in automation, and that coupling labor and robots can lead to higher productivity, economic growth, wages, and profits.</p><p> </p><p>Increases in the quality of labor come from more and better education and training of employees. Capital drives labor and total productivity growth through investments in machines, computers, and robotics that produce output. Robots are unquestionably making the machine-like aspect of production facilities more efficient. Even if the human productivity of factories remains constant, increased use of industrial robots makes sense, which is why both <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/growth-stocks/apple-vs-amazon-stock-better-buy\">Amazon</a></span> and <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/growth-stocks/the-next-tesla-tsla-stock-here-are-8-potential-candidates\">Tesla</a></span> use them in their warehouses and factories, respectively.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>While you have seen a multitude of stories about the rise of robots in manufacturing as well as everyday life, you may not be aware of <b>FANUC (FANUY),</b> a conservative <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/growth-stocks/blue-chip-japanese-stocks-partner-for-growth\">Japanese</a></span> blue chip with little debt, a sterling reputation, and a storied past.</p><p> </p><p>Based in Oshino, a village at the foot of Mount Fuji, Fanuc is the world’s leading manufacturer of computerized numerical control (CNC) devices that are used in machine tools and also serve as the “brains” of industrial robots. Fanuc claims to be the only company that uses robots to make robots.</p><p> </p><p>Fanuc, whose name is an acronym for Fuji Automatic Numerical Control, has been a world leader in robotics since the early 1970s. It was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu in 1955 after that electronics giant decided to enter the factory automation business.</p><p> </p><p>Today Fanuc is as global as it gets, with over 240 joint ventures and offices in over 46 countries and a commanding 65% share of the world market. For example, industrial robot manufacturer Shanghai-Fanuc Robotics Co. Ltd. has a plant in Shanghai.</p><p> </p><p>The company can churn out 10,000 industrial robots per month, double that of its closest competitor, but while it stays on the edge of new technologies, it’s a conservative company. Watching costs carefully leads to exceptional operating margins of 20%-plus, while their competitors are around 10%.</p><p> </p><p>Over time, Fanuc has become a key supplier to some of the world’s most important industries, eclipsing 1 million robots overall. Major car manufacturers, including Tesla, are often assembled and welded by yellow robots.</p><p> </p><p>The frames of iPhones are made in its Robodrill machines and FANUC’s robots also help with the production of aeronautical components and even apply the varnish on Fender guitars. CSLA estimates its U.S. market share at 50% and in China at about 20%. Exports account for 90% of Fanuc’s sales.</p><p><sup> </sup></p><p>Fanuc should benefit from robust demand from developed markets as well as China, as its manufacturing wages continue to increase and manufacturers look to invest in automation and robots to increase productivity. You can find Fanuc robots at Amazon warehouses as well as the shop floor of General Motors.</p><p>Use of industrial robots has allowed companies like <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://na.panasonic.com/us/industries/manufacturing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panasonic</a></span> to run factories that produce 2 million plasma television sets a month with just 25 people.</p><p>Fanuc’s stock offers investors a pristine balance sheet with zero debt and a whopping $4 billion in cash. Profit margins are impressive, and Fanuc has announced plans to buy back an additional 12.5 million shares by April of next year. </p><p>In short, Fanuc is a high-quality play on what seems to be an unstoppable trend.</p><p>[author_ad]</p><p><i>*This post has been updated from a previously published version.</i></p>\n</div>",

The last time it happened was during a four-year run from 1995-1998, before the dotcom bubble popped.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>On Monday, semiconductor heavyweight <b>Qualcomm (QCOM)</b> surged by roughly 12% on the day following a major strategic announcement in the rapidly growing artificial-intelligence infrastructure market.</p><p><span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/qualcomm-unveils-ai200-and-ai250-redefining-rack-scale-data-cent\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qualcomm announced two new AI-inference-optimized chips</a></span>, dubbed the AI200 (for 2026) and AI250 (for 2027). This breaks ground for Qualcomm on two fronts: The first being that inference-first chips are aimed at the processing power required to <i>run</i> AI models (answer queries, generate video, etc.) rather than <i>train </i>AI models (the GPU-intensive workload that’s been largely behind the <b>Nvidia (NVDA)</b> move over the last few years).</p><p>Second, it’s a departure from Qualcomm’s long-standing mobile-first mindset and represents the company’s first foray into the high-growth AI data center market.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>On top of the chip announcement, Qualcomm disclosed that they already have a customer lined up, with <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/humain-and-qualcomm-to-deploy-ai-infrastructure-in-saudi-arabia-\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Saudi-based HUMAIN planning to deploy 200 megawatts (MW) of AI200/AI250 server racks starting in 2026</a></span>.</p><p>For an established chipset and mobile-first company like Qualcomm, the shift into AI infrastructure is a big deal.</p><h2>Qualcomm’s Shift to AI Infrastructure</h2><p>Historically, its business has been tied heavily to smartphones and wireless connectivity, a space that is maturing and highly competitive. But with the surge in generative AI applications, data center expansion and AI deployment, Qualcomm is betting that the “next frontier” for semiconductors is increasingly in high-end inference and model deployment, and not just phone chips.</p><p>Of course, these developments don’t preclude Qualcomm from benefiting from growth in AI-enabled phone chips. Should models continue to evolve to the point that local AI (meaning running on your own hardware and not on a data center you interact with via the cloud) becomes more feasible for most consumers, the inference specialization should pay dividends for Qualcomm in that market as well.</p><p>In fact, the leap to data centers was partially fueled by experience developed on the humble Windows PC, as the company has cited its Hexagon neural processing unit (NPU) as enabling them to learn and scale for the new AI chips; there’s no reason the company can’t then take its data center expertise and redirect (and minify) it for next-generation smartphone chips.</p><p>Plus, by expanding into the high-demand data center space, Qualcomm gets the added benefit of (at least partially) decoupling itself from the smartphone upgrade cycle, something that Cabot’s Tom Hutchinson has written about in regards to Qualcomm before.</p><p>What’s particularly noteworthy about this development is how companies will be able to deploy these new chips, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-stock-spikes-more-than-20-as-company-enters-ai-chip-race-taking-on-nvidia-amd-140024616.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">per Yahoo! Finance</a></span>:</p><p>“According to Durga Malladi, senior vice president and GM for technology planning, edge solutions, and data centers at Qualcomm, they’ll be able to choose either individual chips, portions of the company’s server offerings, or the entire setup.</p><p>“And those customers, Malladi said, could include the likes of Nvidia and AMD, making the companies both rivals and potential partners.”</p><p>It’s an interesting development for sure, and the success or failure of the gambit will, as seems to so frequently be the case these days, hinge on the eventual uptake of AI tools themselves.</p><p>After all, these inference-first chips aren’t building new AI models, they’re delivering processing power for their actual use, meaning there’s less room for speculative buildout (it’s one thing to sell server capacity to hyperscalers as they develop bleeding-edge models, it’s another thing entirely to sell server capacity to a company that’s trying to commercialize those models once they exist).</p><p>As for the investing case, I’ll defer to Cabot’s resident Qualcomm expert, Tom Hutchinson, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/tech-stocks/forget-the-fed-bet-on-this-ai-stock\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">who laid out his bull case for Qualcomm last year</a></span>.

This has been favorable for consumers, as the lower average oil price over the last couple of years has taken some of the sting out of the higher costs of retail goods that have prevailed over that period.</p><p> </p><p>But recent market and political developments suggest that dynamic may soon be over. And if, as many industry analysts are predicting, oil prices take flight in the coming months, inflation could surge with renewed vigor, putting new pressure on multiple industries while benefiting a number of firms that play in the oil patch, like <b>SLB Ltd. (SLB)</b>.</p><p> </p><p>In the latest week, oil prices were up 11% from recent lows of around 56 dollars a barrel, with the catalyst being the imposition of <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil</a></span> over the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions also prompted energy firms in China and India to consider cutting Russian imports, according to a Reuters news report.</p><p> </p><p>The report quoted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, who said: “The announcement of sanctions by the U.S. on Rosneft and Lukoil is a major escalation in the targeting of Russia’s energy sector and could be a big enough shock to flip the global oil market into a deficit next year.” Russia accounts for around 7% of global oil supply.</p><p> </p><p>Growing tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela—a country that holds the world’s largest proven crude-oil reserves—could also push oil prices higher, since a disruption of Venezuelan supply (or broader instability in the region) would add risk to global crude markets.</p><p> </p><p>Yet another factor worth mentioning is that commercial traders in the petroleum industry (e.g., producers, refiners and merchants) are at one of their lowest net short positions in the crude oil futures market since 2010. As recently noted by market analyst Tom McClellan, past instances of this phenomenon have resulted in surging oil prices on a multi-month basis.</p><p> </p><p>Moreover, as noted by Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, smaller speculators in the crude oil futures market have been increasing their short positions of late—a phenomenon which tends to be bullish for oil prices from a contrarian perspective.</p><div class=\"Enhancement ImageEnhancement\" data-align-center=\"\">\n<div class=\"Enhancement-item\">\n<figure class=\"Figure\">\n<a class=\"AnchorLink\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" id=\"image-8f0000\" name=\"image-8f0000\"></a>\n<picture>\n<source height=\"299\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/0914032/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/600x299!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png 1x,https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/765b450/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/1200x598!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png 2x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"299\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/37ece36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/600x299!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"231\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/96f0302/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/464x231!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png 1x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"464\"/>\n<source height=\"231\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a83763/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/464x231!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png\" width=\"464\"/>\n<img alt=\"crude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png\" class=\"Image\" height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a83763/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/464x231!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a83763/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1296x646+0+0/resize/464x231!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F4d%2F38334ede4c84990c107c370b31ff%2Fcrude-oil-net-futures-position-large-traders.png 1x\" width=\"464\"/>\n</picture>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div><p><i>Source: MacroMicro</i></p><p> </p><p>Hansen stated in an October 21 report that, “[M]anaged money accounts have been reducing long exposure in recent weeks while adding to gross shorts, betting on further downside as inventories build and the curve softens,” with Brent crude data from the ICE Europe Exchange recently showing a jump in the gross short position for this class of trader (who are often on the wrong side of the market trend) to a 13-month high.</p><h2><b>Why This Bodes Well for SLB Ltd. (SLB)</b></h2><p> </p><p>The bullish implications for oil drilling and exploration companies cannot be understated. Indeed, an improvement in the overall energy price outlook should be of benefit to the major producers going forward, in turn lifting the profit outlook for <b>SLB Ltd. (SLB)</b>, the world’s largest oilfield services provider.</p><p> </p><p>The significant rise in crude oil prices that I’m envisioning stands to incentivize oil and gas companies to increase exploration and production (E&amp;P) spending—both onshore and offshore—which drives demand for SLB’s oilfield services and technology. That means more wells, more equipment and more services, in turn flowing to service contractors like SLB.</p><p> </p><p>The company just released Q3 financial results, which played out in line with expectations, as revenue increased sequentially, plus further growth in its growing Digital segment and a “resilient performance” of its core business.</p><p> </p><p>And while its key metrics were mixed, the company was sanguine on the year-ahead outlook and guided for improvements going forward, including a deepwater outlook that management said “remains easier to stay and easier to grow as a market.”</p><p> </p><p>Concerning the highly significant Saudi Arabia outlook (a key revenue driver for the company), SLB said, “We have reached a stabilized activity, if not bottom,” while anticipating a likely rebound in the near to midterm, and with increased activity expected for the first half of 2026 for both gas and oil.</p><p> </p><p>In the wake of the <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/stock-market/rules-handling-earnings-season\">earnings</a></span> report, SLB received several new share price upgrades from Wall Street institutions, including an upgrade from Piper Sandler from Neutral to Overweight. The ratings improvement was in part predicated on SLB’s improving Saudi Arabia outlook, which Piper Sandler called “a significant improvement for its rate-of-change story,” in view of the company’s size and scale in that country.</p><p> </p><p>And while Deepwater offshore has been a headwind for SLB’s earnings in recent quarters, the investment bank said that while an “inflection is not expected until mid-to-late 2026,” SLB’s management believe the company’s “healthy pipeline with favorable economics” (due to a number of final investment decisions planned for 2026 and early 2027) should help improvement the outlook for that segment.</p><p> </p><p>All told, increased E&amp;P spending in the wake of anticipated higher crude prices, with resulting improved margins, better utilization and positive sentiment, should combine to lift SLB’s earnings outlook and share price in the coming quarters. As such, I see it as a worthwhile play on what looks like the end of the low crude prices that end-users and consumers alike have taken for granted.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

As opposed to more speculative names, these “liquid leaders” can produce big gains over time, and often can do so in a relatively smooth way (albeit with shakeouts and tests, of course) as big investors pile in.</p><p>When it comes to AI stocks, <b>Nvidia (NVDA) </b>has clearly been the #1 liquid leader of the entire advance going back to 2023, as its AI chips led to a step-function increase in earnings and, of course, a massive growth wave ever since. The stock obviously had a huge run in 2023 and 2024, and after a re-set base (a big, long correction that re-sets the longer-term advance), NVDA came back beautifully from the tariff panic, rallying 11 weeks in a row at one point to hit new highs in August.</p><div class=\"Enhancement ImageEnhancement\" data-align-center=\"\">\n<div class=\"Enhancement-item\">\n<figure class=\"Figure\">\n<a class=\"AnchorLink\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" id=\"image-530000\" name=\"image-530000\"></a>\n<picture>\n<source height=\"426\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/7ad27d6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/561x426!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png 1x,https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/f2da394/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/1122x852!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png 2x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"561\"/>\n<source height=\"426\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/6446495/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/561x426!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png\" width=\"561\"/>\n<source height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/c9092c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/464x352!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png 1x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"464\"/>\n<source height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/eaf4f38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/464x352!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png\" width=\"464\"/>\n<img alt=\"NVDA-10-23-25.png\" class=\"Image\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/eaf4f38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/464x352!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/eaf4f38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/561x426+0+0/resize/464x352!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fc0%2Ffc0e28804a3980a22dcdc2b3b85b%2Fnvda-10-23-25.png 1x\" width=\"464\"/>\n</picture>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div><p>However, since then, shares haven’t done anything—two months of no progress after an up-and-down period.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>Warren Buffett famously loves companies with <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/how-to-invest/how-to-profit-from-moat-stocks\">moats</a></span>.</p><p>The presence of protective moats around his holdings is one of the main reasons he’s outperformed over the years.</p><p>Moats are relatively easy to recognize and understand, compared to the more complex qualities Buffett likes – such as low discounted cash flow valuations or supreme earnings quality. This is one reason why I like to look for strong moat companies all the time when considering stocks to own and suggest.</p><p>Simply put, moats derive from some characteristics that protect a company from competition. It can be a powerful brand, like at <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/dividend-stocks/coke-vs-pepsi-stock-comparison\"><b>Coca-Cola (KO)</b></a></span>, or a technical know-how advantage like at <b>Tesla (TSLA)</b>. It can be some quality that simply makes it difficult for competitors to enter a business – like with railroads, which are hard to replicate. Buffett likes the railroad moat so much, he bought BNSF Railway outright in 2010.</p><h2>My Own Twist: A Strong Moat Plus Insider Buying</h2><p>A powerful combination I have used over the years is when insiders are buying large amounts of stock in a company with a moat.</p><p>That’s exactly what we have with the railroad <b>CSX (CSX)</b>. CSX has a strong moat because it’s nearly impossible to create a new railroad. Not only would it be expensive to build out a network of tracks, you’d also have to get easements to use property throughout a region or across the country. Not happening anymore, compared to the early 1800s when railroads were first built out in the U.S. Sure, railroads compete with trucks and airplanes in shipping goods. But railroads have a big cost advantage, and their pricing tends to hold up well in recessions.</p><p> </p><p>Originally founded in 1827 as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (B&amp;O), CSX now has about 20,000 miles of track serving 26 states east of the Mississippi River. It has access to over 70 port terminals. This reach helps it ship the goods of manufacturers, including those in the automotive sector, farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and energy producers.</p><p> </p><h3><b>5 Bullish Factors for CSX Corp. (CSX)</b></h3><p> </p><p>Beyond the moat, here are five factors that could move CSX shares higher from here.</p><p> </p><p>* CSX is advancing its “precision scheduled railroading.” That’s a fancy way of saying it is improving and targeting its mix of assets – like yards, locomotives and rolling stock – to boost efficiency and profitability.</p><p> </p><p>* CSX has finally finished two large infrastructure projects that were creating cost headwinds. Now, CSX’s operating ratio, or expenses divided by revenue, has a better chance of improving.</p><p> </p><p>* CSX continues to be a takeout candidate following the agreement by Union Pacific (UNP) to buy Norfolk Southern (NSC).</p><p> </p><p>* An activist investor continues to pressure CSX to implement tactics it thinks will make the stock go up (more on this, below).</p><p> </p><p>* CSX has balance sheet strength and strong cash flow. This supports the stock in downdrafts, and it also backs the 1.45% dividend yield.</p><p> </p><h3><b>The Insider Buying</b></h3><p> </p><p>CEO Steve Angel recently bought $2 million worth of stock at around $36.80. This is both a size buy and a C-suite purchase, both good qualities to look for in <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/value-stocks/insider-buying-signal-market-beating-stock-returns\">insider buying</a></span> analysis.</p><p> </p><p>One potential demerit might be that Angel is a new CEO who just took the helm here. That means his buying might be part of his employment contract. I don’t see this requirement in the CSX 8-K filing announcing his hiring, but the actual employment contract is not yet available.</p><p> </p><p>Even if he was required to buy stock, I never really consider this dynamic to be a negative. After all, Angel probably had a lot of options for his next gig. If he was required to buy stock, he knew it going in, and he went ahead anyway. So, the buying is still a signal that he likes the prospects for CSX.</p><p> </p><h3><b>The Activist Angle</b></h3><p> </p><p>Angel came in as part of an activist investor campaign by Ancora Holdings Group, which owns a stake here. Ancora had been on a quest to oust outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs, who Ancora thinks did a poor job. It has a higher regard for Angel, who brings experience as the CEO of <b>Linde (LIN)</b> and in various management roles during his 22 years at <b>General Electric (GE)</b>.</p><p> </p><p>In a letter lauding the CEO transition, Ancora says it continues to buy CSX stock. A larger position gives Ancora more leverage in its campaign to encourage management tactics that may boost the stock.</p><p>If you’d like to be notified the next time I write about insider buying signals—and get exclusive insights—<span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://investments.cabotwealth.com/insider\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a></span>.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "How to Use Tax Loss Harvesting",
            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>If you just look at the performance of the major indexes, this has been yet another good year for the markets. </p><p>But with the recent return of volatility (as well as a couple of individual stock blow-ups), odds are good that you may have a few losing stocks in the mix as well.</p><p>It’s an inevitable part of investing. After all, nobody picks only winners. But now that the end of the year is approaching, it’s a good time to consider putting those losses to work.</p><p>So, before you get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, now may be a good time to take a hard look at your portfolio for some losses to offset gains via a strategy called tax loss harvesting.</p><p>Tax loss harvesting is simply a tax-efficient strategy that involves selling taxable investment assets—including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds—at a loss in order to reduce your tax liability. All you do is apply this loss against any capital gains in your portfolio, and that, effectively, will reduce your overall capital gains taxes.</p><p> [text_ad]</p><p>If you have had more losses than gains in 2025, the IRS will let you apply up to $3,000 in losses against your other income. And then you can carry over any remaining losses to offset income in the future.</p><h2>Tax Loss Harvesting Example Scenarios</h2><p>Here are some examples of tax loss harvesting:</p><p><i>Scenario 1: </i>You sell shares of XYZ Company and lose $4,000. Then you sell shares of ABC Company for a gain of $5,000. You’re ahead $1,000 and would normally pay capital gains taxes on that $1,000 gain. You have offset your total gain by the $4,000 loss you took on the shares of XYZ Company.</p><p><i>Scenario 2: </i>Now, what if you actually lost $6,000 on the sale of XYZ Company shares? And let’s pretend that you still sold your shares of ABC Company for a $5,000 gain. So, you’re in the hole by $1,000. But the IRS lets you apply that to your regular income, up to $3,000 per year. So, you are effectively reducing your income.</p><p><i>Scenario 3: </i>Next, let’s say you lost $10,000 on selling the shares of XYZ Company. And you still sold ABC Company shares for $5,000. Now, you have a net loss of $5,000. Well, the IRS says you can only use $3,000 of that loss to reduce your income this year. However, next year, you have another maximum $3,000 of offset. So, you can take the remaining $2,000 loss from this year and reduce your income by $2,000 next year.</p><p>The ultimate goal of using this tax loss harvesting strategy is to defer income taxes many years into the future, hopefully, after you <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/dividend-stocks/retirement-savings-calculator-pros-cons\">retire</a></span>, when you’ll probably be subject to a lower tax bracket. And along the way, your portfolio will continue to expand as you are deferring taxes on your gains, instead of depleting the portfolio to pay capital gains taxes each year.</p><p><i>This post has been partially excerpted from a previous article from </i>Cabot Money Club Magazine<i>.

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>The market is perched near the all-time high while economic and political <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/stock-market/uncertainty-an-investors-best-friend\">uncertainty is rising</a></span>. Fortunately, health care stocks are ideally suited for just such an environment.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is up over 14% YTD after posting two consecutive 20%-plus return years in 2023 and 2024. There are good reasons for the strong market. We are in a Fed rate-cutting cycle. The economy is nowhere near recession. And the artificial intelligence catalyst continues to power the market’s largest sector higher.</p><p>At the same time, trade and tariff tensions with China are escalating. The <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/stock-market/how-the-stock-market-performed-during-the-last-government-shutdown\">government shutdown</a></span> is already the third-longest in history, with no end in sight. And there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the economy. It needs to be strong enough to power corporate earnings but weak enough for the Fed to continue cutting rates.</p><p>The current situation calls for stocks that can participate if the market continues to rise but can also thrive if the market hits a rough patch. The ideal choice is health care.</p><p>While the overall market is expensive, the <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/value-stocks/returning-strength-in-the-healthcare-sector\">health care sector</a></span> is not. In fact, it was the worst-performing sector of the eleven S&amp;P 500 stock sectors year-to-date until a couple of weeks ago and is still the second-worst-performing sector over the past year. But these stocks offer both defense and growth, and a recent catalyst may have ignited the sector to make up for lost time in the months ahead.</p><p>Health care stocks have a long history as a stabilizer during periods of economic and political uncertainty, with a record of outperformance in rough markets. It’s the ultimate defensive industry, as people get sick and take medicine regardless of the state of the market or the economy. But it has also become a growth industry as the population is older than ever before and continues to get older at warp speed.</p><p>The fastest-growing segment of the population is 65 and older, as an average of 10,000 baby boomers continue to turn 65 every single day. Health care spending now comprises more than 20% of GDP, and the number is sure to grow. Of course, health care had all that going for it over the past year while stocks floundered. What’s different now?</p><p>Health care stocks had been held back by uncertainty regarding tariff and pricing issues. The Trump administration had promised to target drug imports for tariffs, and many major drug companies manufacture overseas. The administration also pushed “most favored nation” pricing that would align U.S. drug prices with much cheaper overseas prices. Without clarity on these issues, most health care stocks were unable to generate sustainable upside traction.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>But that clarity has finally arrived. At the beginning of this month, President Trump announced 100% tariffs on imported drugs. However, the policy provided an exemption for companies investing in the U.S. Many companies were already doing this, and others simply planned to invest. Later, <b>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)</b> announced a deal with the administration regarding pricing.</p><p>Pfizer committed to lowering prices on several medications in the U.S., particularly for state Medicaid programs and through a new federal website, <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"http://www.TrumpRx.gov\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.TrumpRx.gov</a></span>. The Pfizer deal lowers prices on drugs for far fewer customers than previously anticipated, and it is likely that other drug companies can make similar arrangements. Following the tariff and Pfizer announcements, the health care sector had the strongest weekly rally in more than 20 years.</p><p>Health care stocks are cheap and an ideal choice amid the current high prices and growing uncertainty. The issues that were holding back the stocks appear to have been resolved. The better stocks should make up for lost time in the current environment. Here are two of the best.</p><h2><b>2 Health Care Stocks to Buy Now</b></h2><p></p><h3><b>AbbVie Inc.

But the tremendous success of that drug became a problem as Humira lost its patent overseas a few years ago, and it lost its U.S. patent in 2023.</p><p>Because of shrinking Humira sales, AbbVie posted lower year-over-year revenues in 2023 and the first half of 2024. But the company turned that corner. AbbVie has long planned for this eventuality and has done a stellar job launching new drugs capable of replacing the diminishing Humira revenue.</p><p>Humira accounted for 75% of revenue a few years ago. But new immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq together now have sales that already replace peak Humira revenues. In the most recent quarter, the two drugs had combined revenue of $6.5 billion, on pace to best the best Humira year. AbbVie has also guided for the two drugs to bring in $31 billion in 2027 and $40 billion by 2029.</p><p>While those drugs are killing it, AbbVie also has a robust pipeline of new drugs in the hopper, including important cutting-edge indications in the areas of blood cancer and Parkinson’s. In fact, there are currently 20 drugs in phase III, the final phase before approval. AbbVie also currently has over 50 drugs in earlier phases.</p><p>AbbVie returned to profitability in 2024. The earnings report showed AbbVie has replaced the Humira revenue and is well on track for strong earnings growth in the years ahead. The patent cliff had been holding the stock back, but that’s gone now. And the company has guided for 21% revenue growth in 2025. It is also expected to grow earnings 23% over the next year.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><b>Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)</b></h3><p><b>Yield: 0.71%</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p>Eli Lilly and Co.

Over the past one-year period, LLY has returned -11% while the S&amp;P was up over 13%. But the stock has suffered an occasional lackluster year periodically through the past ten years.</p><p>Indiana-based Eli Lilly is a global pharmaceutical company with over $53 billion in annual revenue, 41,000 employees, and sales in 110 countries. Founded in 1876, Lilly is noteworthy for its unusually high focus on research and development (R&amp;D), where it allocates well over 20% of sales compared to an average of high teens for the industry.</p><p>The R&amp;D focus pays off, as Lilly has arguably the very best pipeline and lineup of recently launched drugs in the industry. Lilly currently has three drugs under FDA review, 28 in phase III, and 52 drugs in earlier phases. Breast cancer drug Verzenio is a potential multi-billion-dollar blockbuster. The primary focus is on neuroscience, cardiometabolic, cancer, and immunology.</p><p>The recent catalyst for the stock has been mega-blockbuster weight-loss drugs. Weight-loss drugs are the hottest thing in the industry now because of the massive potential market where 30% of the population is obese and there is a huge runway for growth. Its new weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro are killing it. Plus, Alzheimer’s disease drug donanemab also has mega-blockbuster potential.</p><p>In the second quarter, Zepbound and Mounjaro generated a staggering $8.5 billion for just the quarter. The company reported revenue growth of 38% for the quarter and EPS growth of 92%. Lilly is guiding for full-year 2025 revenue growth of 36% and earnings per share growth of 92% at the midpoints.</p><p>It has a weight-loss drug in late-stage trials that is taken orally. The current drugs on the market require an injection. It could be a game-changer in the white-hot weight-loss drug arena. Drugs taken orally are more desirable and cheaper to manufacture. The weight-loss drug market is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030. The first oral drug could give Lilly a huge further boost in this massive market.</p><p>LLY has sputtered somewhat over the past year. Some of that is consolidation after the huge recent price spikes. But it is likely also because of uncertainty regarding pricing and tariff issues that are being resolved. The massive expected earnings growth over the next several years justifies continuing high stock returns.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody\">\n<p>The introduction of fear to the financial market can be either a good thing or a bad thing—but seldom is it neither.</p><p> </p><p>In the first case, increasing fear among investors in an environment characterized by fairly limited public participation (i.e., an uncrowded market), relatively unstretched valuations and plenty of liquidity often results in the “wall of worry” phenomenon in which stocks actually benefit from the rising fear levels.</p><p> </p><p>In the other case, too much public participation, overvaluation and shrinking liquidity can combine to prompt intense selling pressures, making the appearance of fear self-fulfilling (as the market experienced in 2008).</p><p> </p><p>For much of the past year, periodic bouts of worry among traders concerning tariffs or inflation have benefited the stock market, since a benign backdrop has mostly prevailed. But with the advent of fresh credit-related fears across several markets—including for auto loans, credit cards, student loans and, more recently, regional banks—the latest increase of fear is making its presence felt in concerning ways.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>The <i>Financial Times </i>recently ran the headline: “U.S. regional bank shares sink on credit worries after fraud disclosures.” It highlighted disclosures by <b>Western Alliance Bank (WAL)</b> and <b>Zions Bancorp (ZION)</b> that revealed both lenders were exposed to “alleged fraud by borrowers, raising broader concerns about the health of bank loan portfolios.”</p><p> </p><p>This development follows closely on the heels of the loan-related problems for the subprime auto lender Tricolor, which have left credit investors with significant losses, while prompting increased scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice. The latest revelations also prompted a sharp sell-off in some of the market’s leading regional bank shares in what, for many of them, was their biggest one-day decline of the year.</p><p> </p><p>Also reflecting the rising credit concerns is the latest share price performance for investment bank <b>Jefferies (JEF)</b>, which has seen its stock plunge over 30% in just the last couple of weeks, its worst performance since March 2020. Accounting for the selling pressure are worries over the bank’s exposure to global automotive parts producer First Brands, which last month filed for bankruptcy.</p><div class=\"Enhancement ImageEnhancement\" data-align-center=\"\">\n<div class=\"Enhancement-item\">\n<figure class=\"Figure\">\n<a class=\"AnchorLink\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" id=\"image-770000\" name=\"image-770000\"></a>\n<picture>\n<source height=\"316\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/77a5c04/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/600x316!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png 1x,https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/a00367f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/1200x632!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png 2x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"316\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/8e0fd56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/600x316!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n<source height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/cc04e65/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/464x244!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png 1x\" type=\"image/webp\" width=\"464\"/>\n<source height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a921e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/464x244!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png\" width=\"464\"/>\n<img alt=\"jef-10-17-25.png\" class=\"Image\" height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a921e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/464x244!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png\" srcset=\"https://cabot.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/2a921e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1226x646+0+0/resize/464x244!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-cabot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F59%2F07295ec943b1858dcbaa13e32ab1%2Fjef-10-17-25.png 1x\" width=\"464\"/>\n</picture>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</div><p>Banking executive Jamie Dimon, in an earnings conference call for <b>JPMorgan (JPM)</b> earlier this week, vocalized the market’s rising concerns over the private credit market when he said, “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.”</p><p> </p><p>However, the return of fear is creating an opportunity for contrarian-minded investors as participants increasingly turn their attention toward under-the-radar, defensive assets.</p><p> </p><p>Indeed, a key feature of turnaround investing involves embracing a contrarian approach.

In fact, as of the end of September, the S&amp;P consumer staples sector was the worst performing of the 11 S&amp;P sectors, with tech and communications services leading the pack.</p><p> </p><p>But in just the last few days, we’ve seen a resurgence of interest in consumer staples, with the <b>Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)</b> rallying strongly. This was after I pegged the staples sector this summer as being a likely outperformer in the latter part of the year in the <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/https:/investments.cabotwealth.com/website-cabot-turnaround-letter\"><i>Cabot Turnaround Letter</i></a></span>.

That could prove prophetic if, as a growing number of analysts are predicting, the more economically sensitive areas of the market enter a period of turbulence in the coming months over ongoing inflation concerns and rising credit risk.</p><p> </p><p>And finally, on the inflation score, with inflation running at an official rate of 3% and 90% of all public fixed income outstanding running at under 5%, this leaves a shrinking rate of real return for investors looking to hedge against inflation. That’s according to the latest survey by Apollo Global Management.</p><p> </p><p>This is likely one explanation for the massive resurgence of interest in gold and silver—and another reason for expecting the momentum in the precious metals to persist. I believe our gold and silver stock mining company holdings will continue to benefit from this trend, and I recommend that investors own some exposure to this market segment to hedge against a potential increase in market turbulence.</p><p>[author_ad]</p>\n</div>",

Having punctured the mainstream and become part of the national zeitgeist, weight-loss drugs were also all the rage on Wall Street. And that was reflected in the share prices of the purveyors of the aforementioned brands (plus Wegovy and Zepbound): <b>Eli Lilly (LLY)</b> and <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.cabotwealth.com/daily/international-stocks/novo-nordisk-nvo-stock-buy-bust\"><b>Novo Nordisk (NVO)</b></a></span>.</p><p>Both those weight-loss drug stocks peaked in Summer 2024. NVO shares had nearly tripled over the previous two years, topping out at more than 140 in June 2024. LLY reached an apex of 960 a share in August 2024, having more than tripled from 300 a share in August 2022.

since the beginning of August. The NVO chart, on the other hand, is pretty grim – it’s fallen 60% in the last 16 months. And yet … weight-loss drugs are as popular as they’ve ever been. Those Ozempic and Mounjaro ads haven’t gone away, and Wegovy and Zepbound have joined them in the mainstream. More people are taking the drugs than ever before, as prices have become more affordable. But the GLP-1 buzz, at least in investing circles, is gone. And the two aforementioned weight-loss drug stocks have exited the “romance” phase of their life cycles, and instead entered the “reality” phase.</p><p>[text_ad]</p><p>And in reality, both stocks look like relative bargains right now. But which is the better bargain? Let’s break it down.</p><h2><b>Tale of the Tape: Eli Lilly (LLY) vs. Novo Nordisk (NVO)</b></h2><p>Trailing P/Es: LLY 54, NOV 15</p><p>Forward P/Es: LLY 27, NVO 14</p><p>Estimated 2025 sales growth: LLY 37%, NVO 8%</p><p>Estimated 2025 EPS growth: LLY 74.6%, NVO 3.8%</p><p>Cash per share: LLY $3.95, NVO $4.26</p><p>Institutional ownership: LLY 83.6%, NVO 9.4%</p><p>In terms of value, NVO has LLY beat by a mile, trading at less than a third of LLY on a trailing price-to-earnings basis and roughly half of it on a forward price-to-earnings basis. Novo Nordisk also has way more cash, with nearly $19 billion total (Eli Lilly has just $3.55 billion) and 31 cents more per share. But it’s not growing nearly as fast as Eli Lilly, on either the top or bottom line.</p><p>And while the Grand Canyon-esque chasm in institutional ownership suggests NVO has far more potential upside if Wall Street latches on … so far, that’s not happening, as the institutional ownership percentage is a fifth of what it was at its June 2024 peak. That’s a mass exodus, and one that ended just recently. While Wall Street abandoned ship on LLY shares too, Lilly’s institutional ownership percentage was only sliced in half, and it has since bounced back to its highest point since April. As a result, LLY shares have built up some real momentum of late, up 9% in the last month. NVO, meanwhile, has been stagnant over the past month.</p><p>Ozempic and Wegovy sales are expected to reach record levels this year. Revenue from Wegovy, in fact, expanded by 56% in the first half of the year. But sales of Ozempic, which accounts for a much bigger slice of Novo Nordisk’s revenue pie, improved by a mere 8% in the first half, well below estimates. Together, those two weight-loss/diabetes drugs accounted for 60% of Novo’s total revenue last year. Hence, the mere 8% revenue growth expected for the Danish drugmaker this year.</p><p>Mounjaro and Zepbound, on the other hand, are still growing revenues at breakneck speeds, with Mounjaro sales up 68% in the second quarter, while Zepbound’s sales more than doubled, up 172% year over year. In addition, those two weight-loss/diabetes drugs account for less than half (48%) of Eli Lilly’s total sales. <span class=\"LinkEnhancement\"><a class=\"Link\" data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A new drug called donanemab, designed to treat patients with Alzheimer’s and which gained FDA approval in July 2024</a></span>, has blockbuster potential for Eli Lilly. It also has Trulicity (for diabetes), Taltz (for autoimmune diseases) and Verzenio (a cancer treatment), among others, in its deep drug portfolio. Eli Lilly is, thus, less dependent on its obesity drugs than Novo Nordisk.</p><h3><b>And the Winner Is….</b></h3><p>Bottom line: Eli Lilly is a more diversified and much faster-growing company than Novo Nordisk. It has earned its higher valuation, and its shares have greater momentum than NVO right now. So while NVO may technically be the better value opportunity, LLY looks like it’s clearly the better stock right now. If you’re looking to regain exposure to the still-fast-growing weight-loss drug sector now that share prices among its two dominant players have come crashing back to much more reasonable levels, LLY is the best way to do it.</p><p>[author_ad]<br/></p>\n</div>",
