Without a doubt, though, those of you living there will be excited to see them popping up in your neighborhoods, easily identifiable by their funny round headlights.</p>\n<p>“Decarbonized transportation is a huge part of Amazon’s goal for net-zero carbon emissions across operations by 2040. It’s partners like Rivian that make this goal feasible,” <a href=\"https://stories.rivian.com/amazon-rivian-edv-fleet-canada\">noted Emily Barber</a>, Director of Global Fleet and Products at Amazon. “We are bringing 100,000 Rivian Electric Delivery Vans on the road by 2030. Today, we have more than 35,000 Electric Delivery Vans globally that have delivered more than 1.5 billion packages. Our mission is to build the safest, most sustainable and advanced fleet in the world.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362820\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1333\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6-400x267.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6-768x512.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-6-1536x1024.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362819\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1340\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2-400x268.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2-800x536.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2-768x515.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-2-1536x1029.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n<p>“We built this state-of-the-art Electric Delivery Van from the ground up, and it’s unlike anything else in the market. Launching our vans in Canada is a proud moment for our entire team,” added Erica Tsypin, Director, B2B Sales &amp; Partnerships, Rivian. “Since our first production vans hit the road in 2022, Rivian and Amazon have learned quite a lot together, which has allowed us to continuously improve the vehicle’s performance, safety and durability as Amazon has scaled these vans across many climates and geographies.”</p>\n<p>Rivian notes that the company worked closely with Amazon delivery drivers in developing the vehicle. Some highlights of the EDV are “360-degree cameras for driver safety, and patented, energy-saving microclimate seats for all-weather comfort.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362818\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1319\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4-400x264.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4-800x528.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4-768x506.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-4-1536x1013.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362816\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1295\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5-400x259.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5-800x518.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5-768x497.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-5-1536x995.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362821\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1332\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3-400x266.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3-768x511.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-3-1536x1023.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n<p>Rivian has been operating in Canada for 5 years. It has the following facilities in place there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A unique space in downtown Vancouver.</li>\n<li>4 service &amp; delivery centers in Toronto, Ontario; Richmond, British Columbia; Montreal, Quebec; and Calgary, Alberta.</li>\n<li>Software engineering hubs in downtown Vancouver and Toronto, which is also where engineers from the company’s joint venture with Volkswagen, Rivian Volkswagen Group Technologies, work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canada continues to advance its electrification and decarbonization efforts. In the wake of extreme, unnecessary conflict with the United States due to the decisions of President Donald Trump, rumor is that it’s possible another big step forward could be coming to The Great White North. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/canada-may-remove-100-percent-tariff-on-chinese-made-cars/\">Canada may drop its 100% tariffs on China-produced electric vehicles</a>. If that was to happen, the country could get access to all manner of high-tech, unbelievably affordable, ridiculously compelling electric vehicles from brands like BYD, XPENG, Leapmotor, Zeekr, Avatr, and NIO, among others. For now, though, this is only a rumor and it could just be a negotiating tactic to push back on some of Trump’s demands and behavior.</p>\n<p>In any case, Canada will have more electric vehicles on the roads this Christmas season thanks to the Amazon and Rivian EDV deployment, and I imagine it won’t be long before that fleet of 50 doubles, triples, and quadruples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362815\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-400x267.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-768x512.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-1536x1024.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362817\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1498\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-400x300.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-800x599.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-768x575.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-1536x1150.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Their demand would allow them to generate emissions credits, undermining the ambition level of the regulation. This could delay production and reduce sales of zero emission trucks (ZETs) by 27% in 2030, according to T&amp;E analysis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This weakening would be a significant setback for logistics companies that are waiting for e-truck prices to come down. Rolling back on already agreed targets to produce electric trucks would create investment uncertainty for Europe’s charging infrastructure industry and risk European truckmakers losing out to Chinese competitors.</p>\n<p>Stef Cornelis, freight and fleet director said “Truckmakers want to give the impression that this is just about a small adjustment, but the opposite is true. It would mean a major rollback of Europe’s plans to decarbonise trucks and cut sales of e-trucks by almost a third in 2030. They are creating huge investment uncertainty for the charging infrastructure and power sector who need to start building grids and charging infrastructure today. The trucking industry claims that lack of charging infrastructure is the main bottleneck but how do they expect a power company to invest if they are now rolling back on their own commitments? The European Commission should hold the line. The more Europe and our truckmakers delay the transition, the more we risk losing the market to Chinese competitors.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362809\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png 1400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-400x286.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-800x571.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-768x549.png 768w\" width=\"1400\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note: This is a T&amp;E modelling of the potential impact of scrapping the linear emission reduction trajectory on zero-emission truck uptake.

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The US government has not been a friend to the vehicle electrification movement this year, to put it kindly. Nevertheless, the pace of zero emission innovation will march on with or without an assist from President Donald Trump. The latest example comes from BMW, which has jumped into the solid state EV battery race with an assist from the US battery materials startup Solid Power and the Korean firm Samsung SDI.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nothing Can Stop The Solid State EV Battery Of The Future</h3>\n<p>A solid state EV battery is just what the name says, a battery that replaces the conventional liquid electrolyte with solid materials. Replacing a liquid with a solid poses all sorts of challenges (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09675-8\">here’s</a> one example), but the payoff for the vehicle electrification movement is substantial (see more <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=solid+state+ev+battery\">solid state battery background here</a>).</p>\n<p>Aside from eliminating fire hazards, a solid state EV battery offers automakers a lighter, more compact, longer lasting, and higher-performing mobile energy storage solution. In short, it helps make <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/new-online-cost-calculator-aims-to-rebuild-ev-sales-in-the-us/\">the case for owning an EV</a> even stronger than ever before.</p>\n<p>With those prizes in mind, battery researchers have been chipping away at the solid state obstacles for a good ten years or so, and all that hard work is about to pay off. Trump or no Trump, the commercialization of a solid state EV battery is a foregone conclusion, and the past month alone has seen a renewed rush of activity.</p>\n<p>The US firm QuantumScape kicked things off by pairing up with Corning to fine tune a new high-efficiency manufacturing system for its <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/30/the-solid-state-ev-battery-race-heats-up-as-corning-quantumscape-join-forces/\">ceramic battery separator</a>. Toyota followed in short order with a reminder that it expects to <a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/43380876.html\">launch EVs into the market</a> with solid state batteries within the next two years or so, and then along comes BMW with some news of its own.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BMW Has A Solid State EV Battery Up Its Sleeve</h3>\n<p>BMW has been eyeballing Solid Power’s solid state solution as far back as 2016. The automaker jumped on the opportunity to invest in Solid Power when it went public in 2021, and BMW further dropped some hints regarding <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/22/100-solid-state-ev-batteries-seal-the-deal-no-more-gasmobiles/\">a collaboration with Solid Power</a> earlier this year. They were not kidding around. Under the newest stage of collaboration with BMW, Solid Power will contribute its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">sulfide-based solid electrolyte</a> to Samsung SDI for use in fabricating solid state battery cells.</p>\n<p>The three firms have not released performance parameters and other details of the new agreement, but the cooperative effort is designed to culminate in the launch of a BMW demonstration vehicle.</p>\n<p>The road from the laboratory to a demonstration vehicle is a long one. Solid Power has been floating across the <em>CleanTechnica</em> radar on and off since launching in 2011, as a spin-off from research at the University of Colorado-Boulder. The company replaces both the liquid electrolyte and polymer separator with a single layer of a sulfide-based solid material.</p>\n<p>“This thin, solid layer acts as a barrier to keep the anode and cathode from touching one another, which would short the battery. It also acts as a conductive electrolyte,” Solid Power explains.</p>\n<p>With an eye on containing costs and fostering rapid scale-up, Solid Power <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">designed its solid state electrolyte</a> around earth-abundant materials and ease of manufacturing. The company isn’t saying exactly what kind of sulfides go into its formula. That’s a trade secret! However, but sulfides (compounds of sulfur with other substances) do occur commonly in nature, one particularly abundant example being the sulfur-iron mineral pyrite, also known as fool’s gold.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sulfides Vs. Ceramics</h3>\n<p>Those of you familiar with the state of solid state EV battery technology are probably familiar with the challenges posed by sulfide-based electrolytes. QuantumScape, for example, is among the solid state stakeholders that have settled on <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/07/12/new-quantumscape-solid-state-ev-battery-exposes-ev-sales-flop-fakery-again/\">high tech ceramics</a> as alternative to sulfide-based electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries.</p>\n<p>Toyota, in contrast, cites several advantages on the sulfide side, including the potential for scale-up. “<a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39865919.html\">Sulfide solid electrolytes</a> are characterized by softness and adhesiveness to other materials, which is suitable for battery mass production,” Toyota also notes. The company has been working with the firm Idemitsu on a lithium sulfide foundation for solid state batteries.</p>\n<p>Stellantis is another <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/23/stellantis-to-demo-muscular-solid-state-ev-battery-in-muscle-car/\">sulfide-curious automaker</a>. Last year the company hooked up with the US solid state battery startup Factorial Energy, which has developed a sulfide-based electrolyte it calls “Solstice.” Factorial also has an ongoing relationship with Mercedes-Benz.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Next Steps For The EV Battery Supply Chain</h3>\n<p>The solid state battery of the future aside, the US still needs to secure its EV battery supply chain here and now. That was a difficult task even before Trump took office earlier this year, one key issue being the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other critical materials.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/21/how-the-us-can-solve-its-lithium-supply-problem-in-one-fell-swoop/\">workarounds</a> have been emerging, including systems that extract lithium from oil and gas drilling wastewater. The ARPA-E branch of the US Department of Energy has just stepped it up a level with the launch of a new $25 million round of funding for new wastewater-based extraction technologies.</p>\n<p>That may seem a bit off-topic for the Trump administration. However, <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-events/news-and-insights/energy-department-announces-25-million-extract-critical-minerals-wastewater\">critical materials</a> have broad applications among key US industries. If the auto industry also benefits, so much the better. After all, what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p>\n<p>The $25 million pot comes under an ARPA-E program called RECOVER, which is the somewhat forced shorthand for “Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters.”</p>\n<p>ARPA-E already anticipates another round of RECOVER funding to follow this week’s announcement. For now, the beneficiaries include The University of Texas – Austin, which will recover lithium and other materials from both oilfield and municipal wastewater.</p>\n<p>RECOVER also tasks Johns Hopkins University with recovering two other key EV battery materials, cobalt and nickel, from industrial wastewater from a variety of sources including e-waste recycling facilities, lithium-ion battery factories, produced water from oilfields, and discharges from mining operations.</p>\n<p>Considering the Trump administration’s fraught (to put it mildly) relationship with Ivy League schools, one project of particular interest is a $1.655 million award to Columbia University to recover lithium and magnesium from wastewater.</p>\n<p>Magnesium (not to be confused with manganese) is a relatively new development in the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/22/magnesium-batteries-are-beginning-to-give-up-their-secrets/\">energy storage</a> field, so stay tuned for more news on that score.</p>\n<p><em>Photo: The US startup Solid Power is contributing its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/overview/default.aspx\">sulfide-based electrolyte</a> to a new solid state EV battery in partnership with BMW and the Korean firm Samsung SDI (cropped, courtesy of Solid Power).</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Carlos Tavares Thinks Tesla Might Be Dead In 10 Years",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Carlos Tavares was the CEO of Stellantis for nearly 4 years, from January 2021 to December 2024. Stellantis is the parent company of 14 brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS Automobiles, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram Trucks, and Vauxhall. So, yes, the guy knows a lot about the automobile business. Whether he’s a genius or an idiot depends on who you ask, but he is one of the few people in the world who has ever run a large automobile company.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/tesla/ane-tavares-musk-tesla-byd-overvalued-company-1027/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Automotive News\">Automotive News</a></em>, Tavares certainly didn’t shy away from making a controversial statement that was always going to garner countless headlines and intense discussion. They key line was: “I’m not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years.”</p>\n<p>Even as a simple possibility, that’s a big statement to make. Tesla has more than $40 billion in the bank and is profitable quarter after quarter. However, as I highlighted recently, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/22/teslas-financial-trends-look-horrible-who-is-to-blame/\">the company has been seeing several negative financial trends</a>. Additionally, as we discuss in a fresh new YouTube video, it does seem like Tesla might be rolling itself into another “bet the company” phase of life. Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, back to Carlos Tavares. He highlighted the growth and evolution of the China EV market, and the possibility that Elon Musk will focus more and more on non-Tesla matters. “We can’t rule out that at some point, he’ll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX, or artificial intelligence,” he said. “Tesla’s stock market loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric. I’m not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. … It’s an innovative group, but they will be beaten by BYD’s efficiency.”</p>\n<p>That has certainly been a common perspective critics of Elon Musk and Tesla have had, but to hear it from a major automobile company CEO — or former CEO — made my jaw drop a bit. If Tavares was a YouTube influencer or journalist, one might say he’s just putting out clickbait, but I don’t think he’s trying to get attention by making this comment. Rather, it is most likely something he believes. Critics will say, “Well, that’s why he was fired from Stellantis. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Maybe. Or maybe he’s on to something.</p>\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/23/7-positives-from-tesla-in-3rd-quarter/\">with $41 billion in the bank</a>, Tesla is in an absolutely fine position at the moment. In the 3rd quarter, the company had revenue of $28.1 billion and net income of $1.8 billion. Not too shabby. It would take several quarters of things going very wrong for Tesla to get into financial trouble. But spending a lot of money while sales go in the wrong direction quarter after quarter can catch up on you quickly. We’ll see what happens. The coming few quarters should tell us a lot more.</p>\n<p><em>Featured <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_Tavares_2_Genf_2018.jpg\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexander-93\" title=\"User:Alexander-93\">Alexander Migl</a> (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0 license</a>)</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Hyundai’s BEV Sales Grow 47% Globally",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Hyundai is involved in all sectors of the auto industry. It’s still selling millions of gas-powered cars a year, it’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/hyundai-pushes-hydrogen-cars-in-japan-%f0%9f%98%82/\">pushing hydrogen-fueled cars</a>, and it has long been seen as one of the better developers of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We really can’t celebrate the first two, but it is good to see that Hyundai continues on path #3 in a good way.</p>\n<p>In a quarterly report published today, Hyundai Motor Company highlighted that its global sales grew 4.8% in the 3rd quarter, but that was really all about growth of its “electrified” vehicles. Their sales rose 37%. But it gets even better — BEV sales rose 47%!</p>\n<p>BEVs reached 87,737 sales. Their percentage growth was only beaten by fuel cell electric vehicles (161%), but those are still at a very small volume of course (3,828 sales in the quarter).</p>\n<p>BEVs were well above plugin hybrids (PHEVs), which rose 26% to 11,301 sales. Hyundai’s largest “electrified” powertrain was conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which rose 32% to 158,629 sales.</p>\n<p>It’s unfortunate to see BEVs still well below the sales of fossil-fueled vehicles (conventional hybrids included), but it’s great to see their strong growth and the fact that their sales volume has reached more than 50% the volume of Hyundai’s hybrid vehicle sales.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/hyundai-motor-company-reports-strong-q3-2025-performance-4.8%2525-global-growth-driven-by-37%2525-electrified-vehicle-surge-0000001043\">the company</a> is proud that “electrified vehicles now represent 25% of total global retail sales — meaning more than one in four Hyundai vehicles sold globally is electrified, up from 19% just one year ago.” BEVs, which I’m sure is what most of us care about, accounted for 8.47% of Hyundai’s sales in the 3rd quarter.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, Hyundai’s BEV sales were boosted a bit by the EV sales rush in the United States from the US tax credit for EVs expiring. Here’s what the company has to say about its North American success:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America’s performance shows that manufacturing localization delivers results. The region achieved 314,964 retail units in Q3, up 13.2%, but the electrified vehicle story is even more compelling: 94,786  electrified units (30.1% of regional sales), up 52.6% year-over-year.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia continues to ramp up IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 production. These are American-made electric vehicles that contributed to 34,244 EV sales, up 52.0%. Palisade Hybrids, Santa Fe Hybrids, and Tucson Hybrids drove 58,774 hybrid sales, up 51.5%.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America now has the highest electrified growth rate of any major Hyundai region, with nearly one-third of all vehicles sold carrying an electrified powertrain. This validates the company’s U.S. investment strategy: build locally, customize to local preferences, and grow with the market.”</p>\n<p>So, it’s not just just BEVs that grew strongly for the brand. Though, not stated by Hyundai is that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/01/hyundai-ioniq-5-sales-soar-90-in-3rd-quarter/\">its BEV sales were up 103.1% in the US</a>, driven especially by the IONIQ 5 (up 90% to <em>21,999 sales</em>) and the IONIQ 9 (which was not on sale yet in the 3rd quarter of 2024 and reached 3,164 sales in the 3rd quarter of 2025) — but even the IONIQ 6 was up 29% to 2,810 sales.</p>\n<p>Naturally, outside of North America, Europe is a big market for Hyundai’s EV sales. “Europe continues its journey toward electrification leadership with 149,757 retail units in Q3, up 3.2%, but more significantly, 71,040 units (47.4% of regional sales) are now electrified, up 28.0 year-over-year,” the company writes. “Europe’s 47.4% electrified penetration rate is a preview of Hyundai’s future globally, where the company targets 60% electrified sales (BEV, HEV, PHEV, EREV, FCEV) by 2030.” In my opinion, that’s still a rather weak target and I do still think Hyundai isn’t aggressive enough with full electrification. But maybe this is the best it can do.</p>\n<p>Regarding actual electric vehicles, Hyundai adds: “The INSTER, named 2025 World Electric Vehicle of the Year, is proving that affordable, practical EVs can succeed in Europe’s competitive market. The IONIQ family continues winning customers from legacy European brands. And the 30,641 EV sales, up 60.1%, demonstrate that when you offer award-winning products at competitive prices, customers respond regardless of market conditions.” That 30,641 total is more than 20% of Hyundai’s European sales, but <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/06/europe-ev-sales-report-second-best-month-ever-for-bevs/\">that’s basically the norm in Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, 47% growth is quite considerable growth. So, kudos to Hyundai. The 4th quarter will likely be tougher, but hopefully the company can surprise us.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "China Omits Mention Of New Energy Vehicles In Latest 5-Year Plan",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Sales of “new energy vehicles” — battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell powered — in China are setting new records month after month. For years, the US, Canada, and Europe have been complaining loud and long about how much China subsidizes its automobile manufacturers — as if the US hasn’t propped up its domestic car industry for decades and Germany has not offered a helping hand from time to time to Mercedes, BMW, and Volkswagen.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, China does provide significant assistance to its auto manufacturing sector, although often indirectly. It promotes science and engineering education so companies will have access to talented researchers and engineers. It prioritizes national supply chains for battery materials and rare earth materials so there will be batteries and electric motors and software available to build electric cars. Other countries could have done the same but elected not to.</p>\n<p>The US, for instance, was an early leader in battery and solar panel production, but stood idly by as China leveraged those technologies. Republicans couldn’t stop hooting with derision when Solyndra, a domestic solar panel manufacturer supported by the Obama administration (and initially the Bush administration), went belly up. But China saw the potential of solar power and committed to making it commercially viable. Now the US is boohooing about how China can make solar panels so cheaply, but in fact it allowed it to happen as part of a general <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/05/why-fossil-fuels-are-having-such-a-hard-time-competing-with-renewables/\">Republican antagonism</a> to renewable energy in all forms.</p>\n<p>A hallmark of China industrial policy is the 5-year plan. The focus of US industrial policy is the 5-minute plan. China establishes clear goals and then makes rational plans to achieve those goals. The US shifts gears up.    every four years, going full speed in one direction, only to reverse course and race full speed in the other direction when it elects a new leader. “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail” is an old maxim that nobody in America seems to pay the slightest attention to.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">China Unveils Next 5-Year Plan</h3>\n<p>China has just announced its latest 5-year plan, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-signals-it-will-pull-plug-subsidies-evs-with-five-year-plan-exclusion-2025-10-29/\">according to <em>Reuters</em></a><em>,</em> it makes no mention of new energy vehicles, which everyone assumes means direct financial support for zero-emissions vehicles will be coming to an end shortly. It does not mean, however, that China will stop supporting higher education or protecting its supply chain dominance.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.electrive.com/2025/10/30/will-china-end-ev-subsidies/\">Electrive</a></em> says the omission of NEVs marks a shift towards market-driven growth, according to industry analysts. NEVs were listed as strategic industries in the last three 5-year plans, which unlocked billions in subsidies that supported both automakers and consumers and bolstered the fortunes of BYD and CATL. Now China apparently has decided its car industry can stand on its own two feet.</p>\n<p>In September 2025, 1.6 million NEVs were sold in China, reaching a market share of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/30/bevs-up-29-yoy-phevs-down-3-yoy-september-2025-china-ev-sales-report/\">49.7 percent</a> — a new record. Battery electric vehicles also set a new record at 1,058,000 units — the first time more than a million battery electric cars were sold in China. With those figures in mind, analysts believe that Beijing considers the industry to be mature enough to do without subsidies and leave further development up to market forces.</p>\n<p>“It’s an official acknowledgement that electric vehicles no longer need prioritized policies. Electric vehicle subsidies will fade,” Dan Wang, China director at consultancy Eurasia Group, told <em>Reuters</em>. “China already dominates in EV-related tech and batteries, so there is no point prioritizing it. It doesn’t mean the government will require capacity to be cut, but the market will play a bigger role in deciding who survives.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the incentives in those past three 5-year plans, China reached its goal of selling more than 50 percent NEVs ten years ahead of schedule, which is a clear indication of the power of planning. But having its domestic car industry focus all its attention on complying with government policy instead of consumer demand has resulted in Chinese manufacturers cranking out twice as many cars as there are customers for.</p>\n<p>For instance, research by Jato Dynamics shows that 93 of China’s 169 carmakers have market shares below 0.1 percent. “From the country’s point of view, it is no longer necessary to pay too much attention (to NEVs), or it may lead to greater overcapacity,” said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics.</p>\n<p>Experts say omitting NEVs from the new 5-year plan should not be seen as a sign that the EV industry has fallen out of favor in Beijing. Instead, it reflects a strategic decision to allocate resources to other technologies where China wants to increase its capabilities, especially in light of global trade and security tensions.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Where China Wants To Go Next</h3>\n<p>The latest 5-year plan was published by the official <em>Xinhua News Agency</em> on October 28, 2025. It prioritizes quantum technology, bio-manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and nuclear fusion as new drivers of economic growth. Xi Jinping has said all along the country’s goal is to become self-sufficient in critical technologies and cut any reliance on foreign nations.</p>\n<p>A policy adviser quoted by <em>Reuters</em> said the exclusion of NEVs “is not to say they’re not important — they absolutely are. Just look at our exports, the source of profits for the entire auto sector, the boost to the industrial chain, and our global leadership. NEVs are undoubtedly important.”</p>\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/china-governments-to-take-2-trillion-bet-on-industrial-upgrading-s101629244]\">S&amp;P Global</a> reported that national and local governments in China are now planning to spend $2 trillion to upgrade key tech industries. Some of that funding will also go to developing solid-state batteries, vehicle intelligence, and autonomous driving technologies. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of China’s Passenger Car Association, said Chinese policymakers will now push EV makers to focus on delivering more innovative products and reduce the production of low quality vehicles.</p>\n<p>Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint, told <em><a href=\"https://www.asiafinancial.com/chinas-ev-subsidy-era-may-end-as-exports-boom-priorities-shift\">Asia Financials</a>:</em> “Brands like BYD and Leapmotor have strengthened their cost advantages by enhancing supply chain integration capabilities and launched more cost-effective products. Meanwhile, Xiaomi and brands under HIMA (Huawei Intelligent Mobility Alliance) have attracted consumers with their strong brand influence and leading ‘intelligent’ features.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Turning To Exports And Foreign Markets</h3>\n<p>In 2024, Chinese automakers invested more in foreign countries than they did in China according to data from <a href=\"https://www.asiafinancial.com/chinese-ev-firms-invest-more-abroad-than-at-home-for-first-time\">Rhodium Group</a>. BYD, Geely, and Great Wall all plan to build factories in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Fewer subsidies at home and investments in foreign markets will help calm the fears of foreign governments about heavily subsidized cars from China.</p>\n<p>Just this week, Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, suggested his country is considering <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/canada-may-remove-100-percent-tariff-on-chinese-made-cars/\">removing the 100 percent tariff</a> that currently applies to Chinese made cars imported to that country. It is likely other countries will follow Canada’s lead if it means more foreign investment and well paying factory jobs.</p>\n<p>According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, BYD saw a nearly 400 percent increase in sales all across Europe last month, with the UK emerging as the biggest offshore market with an astounding 880 percent increase in sales. <em>Asia Financial</em> adds that part of the reason BYD has been so successful is because of Elon Musk running his mouth incessantly in favor of extreme right-wing groups. In September, Tesla sales in the EU fell by 18 percent, following a 42 percent fall in August.</p>\n<p>If you want to know what areas China will be dominant in by 2035, all that is needed is to notice the areas the new plan prioritizes. China has a way of exceeding its goals, so while other are busy whining about what an unfair advantage Chinese companies have, it is busy making its plans a reality.</p>\n<p>Nobody should be surprised about what China’s priorities are. They are published where anyone who cares to look can find them. China’s success should be a signal to others that comprehensive, long range plans are essential to a successful economy. As Forrest Gump put it so elegantly, “If you don’t know where you’re going, you’re not likely to end up there.”</p>\n<p>The United States would do well to learn that lesson. Bluster and bombast are a poor substitute for effective long range planning.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The US EV battery recycler Redwood Materials launched back in 2017 with an A-list pedigree in its pocket, as the brainchild of Tesla Motors co-founder J.B. Straubel. That was back when the EV market had nowhere to go but up, pouring millions of spent batteries into the Redwood supply chain. Now that the EV market in the US has collapsed, what will happen to Redwood? Well, follow the money…</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Another $350 Million For EV Battery Recycling</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/new-online-cost-calculator-aims-to-rebuild-ev-sales-in-the-us/\">EV sales in the US took a nosedive</a> in October, following the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30. The crash was anticipated throughout the EV ecosystem ever since the beginning of July, when the Republican majority in Congress passed a new tax bill that brought the tax credit to its untimely end.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, it may come as a surprise to see A-list investors pour another $350 million into an EV battery recycling startup. After all, if the EV market is shrinking, so are the opportunities to recycle EV batteries. Nevertheless, on October 29th, Redwood announced that its new Series E funding round closed with a haul overtopping $350 million.</p>\n<p>The enthusiastic response of investors is somewhat less surprising in light of Redwood’s current business model, though. From an initial focus on dredging valuable materials from EV batteries, the company recently expanded its operations to cover the booming BESS (battery energy storage) market (see <em>CleanTechnica’s</em> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=redwood+materials\">Redwood archive here</a>).</p>\n<p>The California venture capital firm Eclipse, which spearheaded the Series E round, offered some insights in a blog post on October 23rd authored by newly minted Redwood Board Member Joe Faith.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“Initially focused on <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">battery recycling</a> and cathode active material (CAM) manufacturing — effectively creating one of the only domestic circular supply chains of critical minerals — Redwood’s recent expansion into energy storage has made it an integral part of the electricity ecosystem,” Faith noted.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“The best companies don’t limit themselves to a single product, strategy, or business model,” he emphasized.</p>\n<h3 class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The War On EVs, Wind Turbines, &amp; Solar Panels Is Doomed To Fail</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Redwood investment, Faith’s post is notable for its pushback against US President Donald Trump’s prioritization of fossil energy.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“Along with expanding our domestic portfolio of energy resources (by building out <strong>alternatives such as nuclear and renewables</strong>) and improving infrastructure, the U.S. <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">needs large scale energy storage</a> in order to create a robust, reliable, and efficient domestic electric energy system,” Eclipse insists, taking note of the AI-fueled data center construction boom (emphasis added).</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\">No kidding. In September, the US Solar Energy Industry Association toted up the capacity addition numbers for the first six months of this year. Combined, solar and energy storage accounted for an impressive 82% of new power generating capacity on the US grid. Solar alone accounted for 56%.</p>\n<p>For all the love lavished on coal, oil, and natural gas at the White House (or what’s left of it), the simple fact is that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/27/texas-adds-more-solar-power-because-its-just-better-thats-all/\">solar is the quickest and most economical</a> way to add new capacity, with wind chipping in to a lesser extent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Follow The Money</h3>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">As for J.B. Straubel, the Tesla co-founder was also the automaker’s Chief Technology Officer until leaving in 2019 to tend to Redwood full time. The long stay at Tesla provided Straubel with ample opportunities to assess the EV battery supply chain and develop a closed-loop solution.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\">“This is the mindset that created Redwood in the first place, and the company’s powerful combination of an innovation and execution-oriented culture that has allowed it to successfully create subsequent businesses that address the core needs of our modern industrial age,” Faith wrote, re-emphasizing Redwood’s expansion into the energy storage market.</p>\n<p>Complementing Eclipse’s extensive portfolio of manufacturing ventures, another notable participant in the new Series E funding round is the venture capital arm of NVIDIA, NVentures. The NVIDIA link is interesting enough as-is, and it is particularly interesting given that NVIDIA is part of a broad data center coalition that has just launched a new, flexible data center model aimed at freeing up existing grid capacity.</p>\n<p>Billed as “the world’s first power-flexible AI Factory,” the forthcoming 96-megawatt Aurora AI Factory in Virginia, will “serve as the implementation of a new reference design and certification standard for power-flexible AI infrastructure, enabling utilities to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emerald-ai-teams-with-nvidia-and-partners-to-develop-power-flexible-ai-factory-and-reference-design-to-unlock-100-gw-of-grid-capacity-and-supercharge-the-ai-revolution-302597760.html\">unlock existing grid capacity</a> and rapidly connect new AI data centers,” as described by participating stakeholder Emerald AI.</p>\n<p>I’ve reached out to Emerald for some insights into the energy storage angle. Generally speaking, energy storage systems are source-agnostic, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see nuclear or natural gas play a role in the project. For that matter, Redwood also makes some room for nuclear and natural gas power plants in its energy storage plans.</p>\n<p>“Low-cost, large-scale battery energy storage has emerged as the most immediate and scalable solution to enable AI factory deployment and unlock stranded grid and generation capacity,” Redwood asserts, embracing an all-of-the-above perspective.</p>\n<p>Still, the emphasis is also on wind and solar. “Beyond powering data centers, this storage capacity will benefit industrial electrification and help address the intermittency of domestic renewable generation,” the company adds.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Happened To EV Battery Recycling?</h3>\n<p>With the energy storage market in hand and a fresh haul of $350 million in its pocket, Redwood has taken the pressure off its EV battery recycling business during a very challenging time for the vehicle electrification movement.</p>\n<p>After years of positive EV sales trends, a thick pall of gloom and doom has settled over the US market. Auto industry analysts estimate that EV sales accounted for just 5.2% of the overall new-vehicle market in October, down from 12.9% in September.</p>\n<p>Still, signs of a long term recovery are already brewing. The Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup Slate Auto, for example, is still moving forward with plans to launch a stripped-down, relatively affordable <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/29/slate-autos-new-ev-is-coming-for-your-gasmobile-your-cybertrucks/\">electric pickup truck</a> by the end of next year.</p>\n<p>In August, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/11/ford-unveils-new-affordable-ev-plan-lower-cost-of-ownership-over-five-years-than-a-three-year-old-used-tesla-model-y/\">Ford</a> and <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/08/general-motors-weathers-tariff-storm-to-pursue-1-spot-in-ev-sales/\">General Motors</a> both announced future plans to manufacture more affordable EVs within the next few years. Hyundai also unveiled <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/01/us-automakers-still-plan-to-make-more-evs-faster/\">a new EV strategy</a> for the US in September. While some of those plans are on hold now, they are unlikely to evaporate entirely. After all, automakers have been retooling, opening, and closing factories for more than 100 years, and they will continue to do so long after the current occupant of the White House leaves as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes.</p>\n<p><em>Image (cropped): The EV battery recycler Redwood Materials has expanded into the <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">large scale energy storage market</a>, just in time to catch the coattails of the AI boom (courtesy of Redwood via Eclipse).</em></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BEVs had a record month and represented 37% the total Chinese car market in September.</em></h4>\n<p>We saw plugins score another million-plus sales in September <em>(1.3 million plugins, in a 2.2-million-unit overall market, up 6% YoY),</em> but growth has been slowing down, with September showing a 16% increase over September 2024<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Digging deeper into the numbers, BEVs continued to grow, going up by 29% to 826,000 units, a new record, or 37% of overall sales. PHEVs were down again, this time by 3% YoY, to some 469,000 units. Counting both powertrains together, we get 1.3 million units, the second best month ever, and only a few thousand units below the all-time high set last December.</p>\n<p>With BEVs continuing to grow by double digits and PHEVs accumulating months in red, have we reached a turning point in PHEV adoption?</p>\n<p>These results pull the year-to-date (YTD) tally to over 8.9 million units. So, we should see plugins reach the <em>10 million unit</em> mark if not in October, then surely in November….</p>\n<p>This result pulled the September share to 58%, or 5% above the 53% result of September 2024. BEV share of the market rose to 37%. Expect to see plugins continue to grow their share in the following months. For now, plugins have 52% of the total auto market this year (32% just for BEVs), which means that <strong>most new cars sold in China this year have a plug!</strong></p>\n<p>(Could China reach 55% plugin vehicle share by year end? And be fully electrified before 2035?)</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding exports</strong>, in September, they were up 97% YoY. Plugins represented 40% of the total number of passenger cars exported from China, which means that exports are less electrified than domestic sales.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, much of the export market growth is coming from PHEVs. This technology now represents 33% of all Chinese plugin exports, whereas 12 months ago, it represented just 17% of total EV exports….</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362769\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1792\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2040px) 100vw, 2040px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png 2040w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-400x351.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-800x703.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-768x675.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-1536x1349.png 1536w\" width=\"2040\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>In the overall ranking</strong>, in September, fully fossil-fueled models had just two representatives in the top 10. The best placed was the Nissan Sylphy in 5th, a surprisingly good standing for the compact sedan, while the other 100% ICE model, the Geely Boyue, was something of a surprise. The Chinese crossover saw its sales double year-on-year, currently something of a rarity for an ICE model.</p>\n<p>Still, I believe it will be only a matter of time before we have just one pure ICE representative on the table. But it should still take some time until we see a 100% plugin top 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-A-Segment-Leaders-September.png\"><img

categories</strong>, all but the C segment (compact cars) have 100% plugin podiums. In fact, the C segment is the only segment where ICE models still have representatives<em>. </em>In all other categories, ICE models were absent. This is a recurring theme. So, it’s clear by now that the C segment is the hardest of all to convert into EVs.</p>\n<p>Looking at individual models, the biggest surprise was the podium for the full size category. Xiaomi’s YU7 won the category title in September, and on top of that, Xiaomi had its other model, the SU7 sports sedan, reach the category podium. However, the cell phone maker turned EV startup didn’t get a #1 + #2 win in the full size category this time, as the AITO M8 ended the month between the two Xiaomis.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, while the Wuling Mini EV (A segment) and Geely Xingyuan (B segment) dominate their categories, the BYD Song has disappeared from the midsize podium, giving way to the recently introduced BYD Sealion 06, which now has the role of racing against the Tesla Model Y.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here’s more info and commentary on September’s top selling electric models:</p>\n<h3>#1 — Wuling HongGuang Mini EV</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_EV\">This tiny EV is taking full profit from its generation change</a>, which happened late last year. It is now back among the top sellers, and in September it collected <strong>51,743 registrations</strong>, a significant 79% increase year-on-year, allowing it to snap up the leadership position in that month, its first since July 2022. Thanks to a more rounded design, which kind of reminds of the face of a Panda, and upgraded specs and interiors, SAIC’s smallest hatchback has lost its barebones feel. It now looks more <em>car-like</em>. Wuling even offers a five-door version! Despite all of this, the price hasn’t increased that much, with SAIC’s star model starting at $5,500.</p>\n<h3><strong>#2 — Tesla Model Y</strong></h3>\n<p>Last year’s silver medalist had a <em>positive month</em> in September, growing 6% YoY to <strong>51,173 deliveries</strong>, in part thanks to its new 6-seat version. This provided it with a podium position. Tesla is clearly trying to stop the sales bleed with new variations, but will it be able to go back to the <em>good old days?</em> Unless Elon has a trick up his sleeve, I very much doubt it, especially with new competition like the Xiaomi YU7 and others like it. The YU7 <a href=\"https://carnewschina.com/2025/07/03/beyond-the-numbers-lei-juns-qa-on-xiaomi-yu7/\">got hundreds of thousands of locked-in orders within hours</a>. Those orders have to come from somewhere, and with the market already at 50% share, it won’t be just from ICE models…. Yep, Tesla, but also BYD, will suffer.</p>\n<h3><strong>#3 — Geely Geome Xingyuan</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Geely has struck gold with this one</em>. After a number of failed attempts to launch models that would stay in the best sellers table (Galaxy L6, Galaxy E5, etc.), the Hangzhou make finally found the winning formula to not only beat BYD, but also win the leadership race in the fierce Chinese automotive market. With BYD <em>owning</em> most of the market segments, thanks to multiple popular models, the little Xingyuan profited from the fact that BYD was underrepresented in the lower segments, which had left a space between the <em>A to B segment</em> Seagull and the <em>B to C segment</em> Dolphin. With pricing and specs closer to the Seagull, but with an interior space and quality closer to the Dolphin, the small Geely carved out a space of its own, which has been expanding in every passing month. This September, the small hatchback dropped to the last position on the podium, but it still managed once again to continue in <em>record mode </em>(for the ninth month in a row!) thanks to a best ever score of <strong>48,080 units</strong>. Starting with an 80,000 CNY (+/-$11,000) price, the buyer gets a 30 kWh LFP battery from CATL, which is nothing to write home about until you realize that its price is closer to the BYD Seagull’s (70,000 CNY for the 30 kWh version) than the BYD Dolphin’s (100,000 CNY). Exports? Surely that must be on the cards. But first, Geely will need to finish the production ramp-up and satisfy its own internal market.</p>\n<h3><strong>#4 — BYD Qin Plus (BEV+PHEV)</strong></h3>\n<p>The <em>old dog</em> once again joined the top 5 in September, thanks to <strong>39,132 registrations</strong>, a rather good performance. Its sales stayed essentially flat (+1% YoY), and it was once again the best selling BYD on the table. In the same period, its <em>brother in arms</em>, the Song, was down to less than half of last year’s sales! By the way, this was the second consecutive month without any BYD representative on the podium. Troubles ahead for the Shanzhen make? Back to the Qin’s performance, this volume meant that it was the best selling sedan in China, <em>all powertrains counted</em>. The 7-year-old body might be showing some wrinkles, but the low prices still provide significant demand for the sedan.</p>\n<h3>#5 — BYD Sealion 06 (BEV+PHEV)</h3>\n<p>BYD’s new midsize crossover scored <strong>30,532 registrations</strong>, which was a good performance considering it was only its second full month on the market, and allowed it to win its first top 5 standing, no doubt the first of many. But with the BYD Song apparently going into <em>EV Heaven</em> and the Song L failing to live up to the predecessor’s career, will the Seal 06 be the one to replace the Song on the top of the sales charts? It is positioned at around 150,000 CNY (around 22,000 USD) and has the standard BYD qualities of value for money, design and connectivity. On the EV specs side, the PHEV version has an above average 27 kWh battery, and the BEV version’s top battery has an unimpressive 79 kWh. Also, the 800V architecture is a plus at this price point. This means that the Sealion 06 has enough value for money to have a good career, but it will be difficult, if not impossible, to repeat the Song’s three-peat title streak (2022, ’23, and ’24), as the competition is increasingly more competitive and the Sealion 06 lacks standout features and specs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362775\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1909\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1381px) 100vw, 1381px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png 1381w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-579x800.png 579w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-768x1062.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-1111x1536.png 1111w\" width=\"1381\"/></a></p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the best seller table, despite not having any representative on the podium, BYD took over of <em>all places</em> between 4th and 10th, with the Seagull (9th) and Song (10th) in unusually low places. While the SUV’s place can be justified by the fact that it is nearing the end of its career, the Seagull’s drop (-47% YoY) is harder to understand.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we have two fresh faces (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haval_Raptor\">Haval Raptor</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_YU7\">Xiaomi YU7</a>) that stayed on the table, and another that <i>just debuted in the top 20, </i>in the form of Changan’s Deepal S05.</p>\n<p>Outside the top 20, we have a number of models landing with a bang this month, with BAIC’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcfox_T1\">Arcfox T1</a> being the most impressive of them, not only because it scored a rare five-digit debut month, 10,096 registrations, but also because it is coming from the BAIC stable. BAIC is an OEM that has been outside the top positions in the past few years but has three Best Selling Model trophies in the bag (BAIC EC-Series in 2017 &amp; ’18 and BAIC EU-Series in 2019).</p>\n<p>The others were the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangchengbao_Ti7\">Fangchengbao Ti7</a>, another rugged SUV coming from BYD’s premium brand, that landed with 8,128 registrations, and the highly anticipated new generation <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPeng_P7\">Xpeng P7</a>, which started its career with a strong 8,104 registrations. All the while, the new generation MG 4 is already starting its career with a strong 11,790 registrations. So, although the new MG hatchback doesn’t look as sharp as the original one, it is already leaping ahead of the early sales results of the first generation. It will be interesting to see how the European market will react to it.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Geely Xingyuan consolidates power</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362765\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yep, looking at the 2025 ranking, the little hatchback seems poised to succeed the aging BYD Song as the best seller in China, and considering current sales trends, it seems the Geely model won’t leave that position anytime soon.</p>\n<p>If this trend gets confirmed and the Xingyuan wins the title this year, it will be a first for the Geely conglomerate, and the end of a three-year reign of the BYD Song. And to think that, up until this year, no model from the <em>Geely mothership</em> had even made it to the podium….</p>\n<p>Segment-wise, this would also be a significant change. After two years of podiums made up entirely of midsize models, 2025 could be the year that small cars regain protagonism on the podium.</p>\n<p>After all, the #3 Tesla Model Y has the tiny Wuling Mini EV just 5,000 units behind it. So, although the US crossover remains the favorite for the bronze medal, it is not impossible that the little city car could end in 3rd. Now, imagine that — two small EVs on the Chinese podium! And people say that small EVs aren’t competitive….</p>\n<p>Also interesting to see in the current standing is that we have four models in the top positions, from four different brands! Hurrah for diversity!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362774\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2023\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1381px) 100vw, 1381px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png 1381w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-273x400.png 273w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-546x800.png 546w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-768x1125.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-1049x1536.png 1049w\" width=\"1381\"/></a></p>\n<p>Further down, there were a few position changes. Despite a <em>so so</em> month in September (it saw its sales drop 15% YoY), the Tesla Model 3 benefitted from a horrible month from the Li Xiang L6 (down 52% YoY) to surpass it and reach the 10th spot.</p>\n<p>Further below, there was good news for BYD, with the Yuan Up climbing two positions in September to #13. But the Climber of the Month was the cute Changan Lumin, which jumped from 18th to 15th position.</p>\n<p>Finally, AITO’s M8 large SUV joined the table at #20.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362768\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1792\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2040px) 100vw, 2040px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png 2040w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-400x351.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-800x703.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-768x675.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-1536x1349.png 1536w\" width=\"2040\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Looking at the overall manufacturer ranking (not just electrics)</strong>, it seems BYD has found the demand ceiling in its domestic market. September was another month in red, as it saw its sales drop by a significant 16% YoY, the third month in a row of significant drops.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, #2 Geely is far from these issues, having seen its sales jump 62% September. This is while most foreign representatives are either stagnating or seeing sales drop. (Most, but not all — Audi was 10th thanks to enviable 11% growth YoY.)</p>\n<p>Above Audi, we have the other highlight of the month — fast-growing Leapmotor was at #9, thanks to almost 60,000 registrations. That’s an 85% jump YoY. The startup is currently at the top of its game, and <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2025/08/18/leapmotor-turns-profitable-h1-2025/#\"><em>now that it has become profitable</em></a>, the Valley of Death is behind the nine-year-old startup. A top 5 position seems not only possible, but likely.</p>\n<p>But Leapmotor’s startup leadership could be short-lived, because there are <em>two</em> unstoppable trains coming from behind Leapmotor. One is called Xiaomi (#15 in September, up 209% YoY), while the other is Xpeng (#19, up 201% YoY). Which one of them will be the best selling EV startup in 2025? Please place your bets.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Auto Brands Selling the Most Electric Vehicles in China</h3>\n<p><strong>Looking at the auto brand ranking for plugin vehicles</strong>, there isn’t much news.
