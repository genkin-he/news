            "title": "Hyundai’s BEV Sales Grow 47% Globally",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Hyundai is involved in all sectors of the auto industry. It’s still selling millions of gas-powered cars a year, it’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/hyundai-pushes-hydrogen-cars-in-japan-%f0%9f%98%82/\">pushing hydrogen-fueled cars</a>, and it has long been seen as one of the better developers of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We really can’t celebrate the first two, but it is good to see that Hyundai continues on path #3 in a good way.</p>\n<p>In a quarterly report published today, Hyundai Motor Company highlighted that its global sales grew 4.8% in the 3rd quarter, but that was really all about growth of its “electrified” vehicles. Their sales rose 37%. But it gets even better — BEV sales rose 47%!</p>\n<p>BEVs reached 87,737 sales. Their percentage growth was only beaten by fuel cell electric vehicles (161%), but those are still at a very small volume of course (3,828 sales in the quarter).</p>\n<p>BEVs were well above plugin hybrids (PHEVs), which rose 26% to 11,301 sales. Hyundai’s largest “electrified” powertrain was conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which rose 32% to 158,629 sales.</p>\n<p>It’s unfortunate to see BEVs still well below the sales of fossil-fueled vehicles (conventional hybrids included), but it’s great to see their strong growth and the fact that their sales volume has reached more than 50% the volume of Hyundai’s hybrid vehicle sales.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/hyundai-motor-company-reports-strong-q3-2025-performance-4.8%2525-global-growth-driven-by-37%2525-electrified-vehicle-surge-0000001043\">the company</a> is proud that “electrified vehicles now represent 25% of total global retail sales — meaning more than one in four Hyundai vehicles sold globally is electrified, up from 19% just one year ago.” BEVs, which I’m sure is what most of us care about, accounted for 8.47% of Hyundai’s sales in the 3rd quarter.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, Hyundai’s BEV sales were boosted a bit by the EV sales rush in the United States from the US tax credit for EVs expiring. Here’s what the company has to say about its North American success:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America’s performance shows that manufacturing localization delivers results. The region achieved 314,964 retail units in Q3, up 13.2%, but the electrified vehicle story is even more compelling: 94,786  electrified units (30.1% of regional sales), up 52.6% year-over-year.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia continues to ramp up IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 production. These are American-made electric vehicles that contributed to 34,244 EV sales, up 52.0%. Palisade Hybrids, Santa Fe Hybrids, and Tucson Hybrids drove 58,774 hybrid sales, up 51.5%.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America now has the highest electrified growth rate of any major Hyundai region, with nearly one-third of all vehicles sold carrying an electrified powertrain. This validates the company’s U.S. investment strategy: build locally, customize to local preferences, and grow with the market.”</p>\n<p>So, it’s not just just BEVs that grew strongly for the brand. Though, not stated by Hyundai is that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/01/hyundai-ioniq-5-sales-soar-90-in-3rd-quarter/\">its BEV sales were up 103.1% in the US</a>, driven especially by the IONIQ 5 (up 90% to <em>21,999 sales</em>) and the IONIQ 9 (which was not on sale yet in the 3rd quarter of 2024 and reached 3,164 sales in the 3rd quarter of 2025) — but even the IONIQ 6 was up 29% to 2,810 sales.</p>\n<p>Naturally, outside of North America, Europe is a big market for Hyundai’s EV sales. “Europe continues its journey toward electrification leadership with 149,757 retail units in Q3, up 3.2%, but more significantly, 71,040 units (47.4% of regional sales) are now electrified, up 28.0 year-over-year,” the company writes. “Europe’s 47.4% electrified penetration rate is a preview of Hyundai’s future globally, where the company targets 60% electrified sales (BEV, HEV, PHEV, EREV, FCEV) by 2030.” In my opinion, that’s still a rather weak target and I do still think Hyundai isn’t aggressive enough with full electrification. But maybe this is the best it can do.</p>\n<p>Regarding actual electric vehicles, Hyundai adds: “The INSTER, named 2025 World Electric Vehicle of the Year, is proving that affordable, practical EVs can succeed in Europe’s competitive market. The IONIQ family continues winning customers from legacy European brands. And the 30,641 EV sales, up 60.1%, demonstrate that when you offer award-winning products at competitive prices, customers respond regardless of market conditions.” That 30,641 total is more than 20% of Hyundai’s European sales, but <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/06/europe-ev-sales-report-second-best-month-ever-for-bevs/\">that’s basically the norm in Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, 47% growth is quite considerable growth. So, kudos to Hyundai. The 4th quarter will likely be tougher, but hopefully the company can surprise us.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "China Omits Mention Of New Energy Vehicles In Latest 5-Year Plan",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Sales of “new energy vehicles” — battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell powered — in China are setting new records month after month. For years, the US, Canada, and Europe have been complaining loud and long about how much China subsidizes its automobile manufacturers — as if the US hasn’t propped up its domestic car industry for decades and Germany has not offered a helping hand from time to time to Mercedes, BMW, and Volkswagen.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, China does provide significant assistance to its auto manufacturing sector, although often indirectly. It promotes science and engineering education so companies will have access to talented researchers and engineers. It prioritizes national supply chains for battery materials and rare earth materials so there will be batteries and electric motors and software available to build electric cars. Other countries could have done the same but elected not to.</p>\n<p>The US, for instance, was an early leader in battery and solar panel production, but stood idly by as China leveraged those technologies. Republicans couldn’t stop hooting with derision when Solyndra, a domestic solar panel manufacturer supported by the Obama administration (and initially the Bush administration), went belly up. But China saw the potential of solar power and committed to making it commercially viable. Now the US is boohooing about how China can make solar panels so cheaply, but in fact it allowed it to happen as part of a general <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/05/why-fossil-fuels-are-having-such-a-hard-time-competing-with-renewables/\">Republican antagonism</a> to renewable energy in all forms.</p>\n<p>A hallmark of China industrial policy is the 5-year plan. The focus of US industrial policy is the 5-minute plan. China establishes clear goals and then makes rational plans to achieve those goals. The US shifts gears up.    every four years, going full speed in one direction, only to reverse course and race full speed in the other direction when it elects a new leader. “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail” is an old maxim that nobody in America seems to pay the slightest attention to.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">China Unveils Next 5-Year Plan</h3>\n<p>China has just announced its latest 5-year plan, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-signals-it-will-pull-plug-subsidies-evs-with-five-year-plan-exclusion-2025-10-29/\">according to <em>Reuters</em></a><em>,</em> it makes no mention of new energy vehicles, which everyone assumes means direct financial support for zero-emissions vehicles will be coming to an end shortly. It does not mean, however, that China will stop supporting higher education or protecting its supply chain dominance.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.electrive.com/2025/10/30/will-china-end-ev-subsidies/\">Electrive</a></em> says the omission of NEVs marks a shift towards market-driven growth, according to industry analysts. NEVs were listed as strategic industries in the last three 5-year plans, which unlocked billions in subsidies that supported both automakers and consumers and bolstered the fortunes of BYD and CATL. Now China apparently has decided its car industry can stand on its own two feet.</p>\n<p>In September 2025, 1.6 million NEVs were sold in China, reaching a market share of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/30/bevs-up-29-yoy-phevs-down-3-yoy-september-2025-china-ev-sales-report/\">49.7 percent</a> — a new record. Battery electric vehicles also set a new record at 1,058,000 units — the first time more than a million battery electric cars were sold in China. With those figures in mind, analysts believe that Beijing considers the industry to be mature enough to do without subsidies and leave further development up to market forces.</p>\n<p>“It’s an official acknowledgement that electric vehicles no longer need prioritized policies. Electric vehicle subsidies will fade,” Dan Wang, China director at consultancy Eurasia Group, told <em>Reuters</em>. “China already dominates in EV-related tech and batteries, so there is no point prioritizing it. It doesn’t mean the government will require capacity to be cut, but the market will play a bigger role in deciding who survives.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the incentives in those past three 5-year plans, China reached its goal of selling more than 50 percent NEVs ten years ahead of schedule, which is a clear indication of the power of planning. But having its domestic car industry focus all its attention on complying with government policy instead of consumer demand has resulted in Chinese manufacturers cranking out twice as many cars as there are customers for.</p>\n<p>For instance, research by Jato Dynamics shows that 93 of China’s 169 carmakers have market shares below 0.1 percent. “From the country’s point of view, it is no longer necessary to pay too much attention (to NEVs), or it may lead to greater overcapacity,” said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics.</p>\n<p>Experts say omitting NEVs from the new 5-year plan should not be seen as a sign that the EV industry has fallen out of favor in Beijing. Instead, it reflects a strategic decision to allocate resources to other technologies where China wants to increase its capabilities, especially in light of global trade and security tensions.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Where China Wants To Go Next</h3>\n<p>The latest 5-year plan was published by the official <em>Xinhua News Agency</em> on October 28, 2025. It prioritizes quantum technology, bio-manufacturing, hydrogen energy, and nuclear fusion as new drivers of economic growth. Xi Jinping has said all along the country’s goal is to become self-sufficient in critical technologies and cut any reliance on foreign nations.</p>\n<p>A policy adviser quoted by <em>Reuters</em> said the exclusion of NEVs “is not to say they’re not important — they absolutely are. Just look at our exports, the source of profits for the entire auto sector, the boost to the industrial chain, and our global leadership. NEVs are undoubtedly important.”</p>\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/china-governments-to-take-2-trillion-bet-on-industrial-upgrading-s101629244]\">S&amp;P Global</a> reported that national and local governments in China are now planning to spend $2 trillion to upgrade key tech industries. Some of that funding will also go to developing solid-state batteries, vehicle intelligence, and autonomous driving technologies. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of China’s Passenger Car Association, said Chinese policymakers will now push EV makers to focus on delivering more innovative products and reduce the production of low quality vehicles.</p>\n<p>Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint, told <em><a href=\"https://www.asiafinancial.com/chinas-ev-subsidy-era-may-end-as-exports-boom-priorities-shift\">Asia Financials</a>:</em> “Brands like BYD and Leapmotor have strengthened their cost advantages by enhancing supply chain integration capabilities and launched more cost-effective products. Meanwhile, Xiaomi and brands under HIMA (Huawei Intelligent Mobility Alliance) have attracted consumers with their strong brand influence and leading ‘intelligent’ features.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Turning To Exports And Foreign Markets</h3>\n<p>In 2024, Chinese automakers invested more in foreign countries than they did in China according to data from <a href=\"https://www.asiafinancial.com/chinese-ev-firms-invest-more-abroad-than-at-home-for-first-time\">Rhodium Group</a>. BYD, Geely, and Great Wall all plan to build factories in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Fewer subsidies at home and investments in foreign markets will help calm the fears of foreign governments about heavily subsidized cars from China.</p>\n<p>Just this week, Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, suggested his country is considering <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/canada-may-remove-100-percent-tariff-on-chinese-made-cars/\">removing the 100 percent tariff</a> that currently applies to Chinese made cars imported to that country. It is likely other countries will follow Canada’s lead if it means more foreign investment and well paying factory jobs.</p>\n<p>According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, BYD saw a nearly 400 percent increase in sales all across Europe last month, with the UK emerging as the biggest offshore market with an astounding 880 percent increase in sales. <em>Asia Financial</em> adds that part of the reason BYD has been so successful is because of Elon Musk running his mouth incessantly in favor of extreme right-wing groups. In September, Tesla sales in the EU fell by 18 percent, following a 42 percent fall in August.</p>\n<p>If you want to know what areas China will be dominant in by 2035, all that is needed is to notice the areas the new plan prioritizes. China has a way of exceeding its goals, so while other are busy whining about what an unfair advantage Chinese companies have, it is busy making its plans a reality.</p>\n<p>Nobody should be surprised about what China’s priorities are. They are published where anyone who cares to look can find them. China’s success should be a signal to others that comprehensive, long range plans are essential to a successful economy. As Forrest Gump put it so elegantly, “If you don’t know where you’re going, you’re not likely to end up there.”</p>\n<p>The United States would do well to learn that lesson. Bluster and bombast are a poor substitute for effective long range planning.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "JB Straubel’s Bet On EV Battery Recycling Is Paying Off, Bigly",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The US EV battery recycler Redwood Materials launched back in 2017 with an A-list pedigree in its pocket, as the brainchild of Tesla Motors co-founder J.B. Straubel. That was back when the EV market had nowhere to go but up, pouring millions of spent batteries into the Redwood supply chain. Now that the EV market in the US has collapsed, what will happen to Redwood? Well, follow the money…</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Another $350 Million For EV Battery Recycling</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/new-online-cost-calculator-aims-to-rebuild-ev-sales-in-the-us/\">EV sales in the US took a nosedive</a> in October, following the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30. The crash was anticipated throughout the EV ecosystem ever since the beginning of July, when the Republican majority in Congress passed a new tax bill that brought the tax credit to its untimely end.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, it may come as a surprise to see A-list investors pour another $350 million into an EV battery recycling startup. After all, if the EV market is shrinking, so are the opportunities to recycle EV batteries. Nevertheless, on October 29th, Redwood announced that its new Series E funding round closed with a haul overtopping $350 million.</p>\n<p>The enthusiastic response of investors is somewhat less surprising in light of Redwood’s current business model, though. From an initial focus on dredging valuable materials from EV batteries, the company recently expanded its operations to cover the booming BESS (battery energy storage) market (see <em>CleanTechnica’s</em> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=redwood+materials\">Redwood archive here</a>).</p>\n<p>The California venture capital firm Eclipse, which spearheaded the Series E round, offered some insights in a blog post on October 23rd authored by newly minted Redwood Board Member Joe Faith.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“Initially focused on <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">battery recycling</a> and cathode active material (CAM) manufacturing — effectively creating one of the only domestic circular supply chains of critical minerals — Redwood’s recent expansion into energy storage has made it an integral part of the electricity ecosystem,” Faith noted.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“The best companies don’t limit themselves to a single product, strategy, or business model,” he emphasized.</p>\n<h3 class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The War On EVs, Wind Turbines, &amp; Solar Panels Is Doomed To Fail</h3>\n<p>Beyond the Redwood investment, Faith’s post is notable for its pushback against US President Donald Trump’s prioritization of fossil energy.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">“Along with expanding our domestic portfolio of energy resources (by building out <strong>alternatives such as nuclear and renewables</strong>) and improving infrastructure, the U.S. <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">needs large scale energy storage</a> in order to create a robust, reliable, and efficient domestic electric energy system,” Eclipse insists, taking note of the AI-fueled data center construction boom (emphasis added).</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\">No kidding. In September, the US Solar Energy Industry Association toted up the capacity addition numbers for the first six months of this year. Combined, solar and energy storage accounted for an impressive 82% of new power generating capacity on the US grid. Solar alone accounted for 56%.</p>\n<p>For all the love lavished on coal, oil, and natural gas at the White House (or what’s left of it), the simple fact is that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/27/texas-adds-more-solar-power-because-its-just-better-thats-all/\">solar is the quickest and most economical</a> way to add new capacity, with wind chipping in to a lesser extent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Follow The Money</h3>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\" id=\"\">As for J.B. Straubel, the Tesla co-founder was also the automaker’s Chief Technology Officer until leaving in 2019 to tend to Redwood full time. The long stay at Tesla provided Straubel with ample opportunities to assess the EV battery supply chain and develop a closed-loop solution.</p>\n<p class=\"RichText_RichText__ZHs_3\">“This is the mindset that created Redwood in the first place, and the company’s powerful combination of an innovation and execution-oriented culture that has allowed it to successfully create subsequent businesses that address the core needs of our modern industrial age,” Faith wrote, re-emphasizing Redwood’s expansion into the energy storage market.</p>\n<p>Complementing Eclipse’s extensive portfolio of manufacturing ventures, another notable participant in the new Series E funding round is the venture capital arm of NVIDIA, NVentures. The NVIDIA link is interesting enough as-is, and it is particularly interesting given that NVIDIA is part of a broad data center coalition that has just launched a new, flexible data center model aimed at freeing up existing grid capacity.</p>\n<p>Billed as “the world’s first power-flexible AI Factory,” the forthcoming 96-megawatt Aurora AI Factory in Virginia, will “serve as the implementation of a new reference design and certification standard for power-flexible AI infrastructure, enabling utilities to <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emerald-ai-teams-with-nvidia-and-partners-to-develop-power-flexible-ai-factory-and-reference-design-to-unlock-100-gw-of-grid-capacity-and-supercharge-the-ai-revolution-302597760.html\">unlock existing grid capacity</a> and rapidly connect new AI data centers,” as described by participating stakeholder Emerald AI.</p>\n<p>I’ve reached out to Emerald for some insights into the energy storage angle. Generally speaking, energy storage systems are source-agnostic, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see nuclear or natural gas play a role in the project. For that matter, Redwood also makes some room for nuclear and natural gas power plants in its energy storage plans.</p>\n<p>“Low-cost, large-scale battery energy storage has emerged as the most immediate and scalable solution to enable AI factory deployment and unlock stranded grid and generation capacity,” Redwood asserts, embracing an all-of-the-above perspective.</p>\n<p>Still, the emphasis is also on wind and solar. “Beyond powering data centers, this storage capacity will benefit industrial electrification and help address the intermittency of domestic renewable generation,” the company adds.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Happened To EV Battery Recycling?</h3>\n<p>With the energy storage market in hand and a fresh haul of $350 million in its pocket, Redwood has taken the pressure off its EV battery recycling business during a very challenging time for the vehicle electrification movement.</p>\n<p>After years of positive EV sales trends, a thick pall of gloom and doom has settled over the US market. Auto industry analysts estimate that EV sales accounted for just 5.2% of the overall new-vehicle market in October, down from 12.9% in September.</p>\n<p>Still, signs of a long term recovery are already brewing. The Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup Slate Auto, for example, is still moving forward with plans to launch a stripped-down, relatively affordable <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/29/slate-autos-new-ev-is-coming-for-your-gasmobile-your-cybertrucks/\">electric pickup truck</a> by the end of next year.</p>\n<p>In August, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/11/ford-unveils-new-affordable-ev-plan-lower-cost-of-ownership-over-five-years-than-a-three-year-old-used-tesla-model-y/\">Ford</a> and <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/08/general-motors-weathers-tariff-storm-to-pursue-1-spot-in-ev-sales/\">General Motors</a> both announced future plans to manufacture more affordable EVs within the next few years. Hyundai also unveiled <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/01/us-automakers-still-plan-to-make-more-evs-faster/\">a new EV strategy</a> for the US in September. While some of those plans are on hold now, they are unlikely to evaporate entirely. After all, automakers have been retooling, opening, and closing factories for more than 100 years, and they will continue to do so long after the current occupant of the White House leaves as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes.</p>\n<p><em>Image (cropped): The EV battery recycler Redwood Materials has expanded into the <a href=\"https://eclipse.capital/blog/creating-the-full-circle-of-americas-electric-energy-system/\">large scale energy storage market</a>, just in time to catch the coattails of the AI boom (courtesy of Redwood via Eclipse).</em></p>\n</div>",

PHEVs were down again, this time by 3% YoY, to some 469,000 units. Counting both powertrains together, we get 1.3 million units, the second best month ever, and only a few thousand units below the all-time high set last December.</p>\n<p>With BEVs continuing to grow by double digits and PHEVs accumulating months in red, have we reached a turning point in PHEV adoption?</p>\n<p>These results pull the year-to-date (YTD) tally to over 8.9 million units.

BEV share of the market rose to 37%. Expect to see plugins continue to grow their share in the following months. For now, plugins have 52% of the total auto market this year (32% just for BEVs), which means that <strong>most new cars sold in China this year have a plug!</strong></p>\n<p>(Could China reach 55% plugin vehicle share by year end? And be fully electrified before 2035?)</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding exports</strong>, in September, they were up 97% YoY. Plugins represented 40% of the total number of passenger cars exported from China, which means that exports are less electrified than domestic sales.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, much of the export market growth is coming from PHEVs.

The Chinese crossover saw its sales double year-on-year, currently something of a rarity for an ICE model.</p>\n<p>Still, I believe it will be only a matter of time before we have just one pure ICE representative on the table. But it should still take some time until we see a 100% plugin top 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-A-Segment-Leaders-September.png\"><img

categories</strong>, all but the C segment (compact cars) have 100% plugin podiums. In fact, the C segment is the only segment where ICE models still have representatives<em>. </em>In all other categories, ICE models were absent. This is a recurring theme. So, it’s clear by now that the C segment is the hardest of all to convert into EVs.</p>\n<p>Looking at individual models, the biggest surprise was the podium for the full size category. Xiaomi’s YU7 won the category title in September, and on top of that, Xiaomi had its other model, the SU7 sports sedan, reach the category podium. However, the cell phone maker turned EV startup didn’t get a #1 + #2 win in the full size category this time, as the AITO M8 ended the month between the two Xiaomis.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, while the Wuling Mini EV (A segment) and Geely Xingyuan (B segment) dominate their categories, the BYD Song has disappeared from the midsize podium, giving way to the recently introduced BYD Sealion 06, which now has the role of racing against the Tesla Model Y.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here’s more info and commentary on September’s top selling electric models:</p>\n<h3>#1 — Wuling HongGuang Mini EV</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_EV\">This tiny EV is taking full profit from its generation change</a>, which happened late last year. It is now back among the top sellers, and in September it collected <strong>51,743 registrations</strong>, a significant 79% increase year-on-year, allowing it to snap up the leadership position in that month, its first since July 2022. Thanks to a more rounded design, which kind of reminds of the face of a Panda, and upgraded specs and interiors, SAIC’s smallest hatchback has lost its barebones feel. It now looks more <em>car-like</em>. Wuling even offers a five-door version! Despite all of this, the price hasn’t increased that much, with SAIC’s star model starting at $5,500.</p>\n<h3><strong>#2 — Tesla Model Y</strong></h3>\n<p>Last year’s silver medalist had a <em>positive month</em> in September, growing 6% YoY to <strong>51,173 deliveries</strong>, in part thanks to its new 6-seat version. This provided it with a podium position. Tesla is clearly trying to stop the sales bleed with new variations, but will it be able to go back to the <em>good old days?</em> Unless Elon has a trick up his sleeve, I very much doubt it, especially with new competition like the Xiaomi YU7 and others like it. The YU7 <a href=\"https://carnewschina.com/2025/07/03/beyond-the-numbers-lei-juns-qa-on-xiaomi-yu7/\">got hundreds of thousands of locked-in orders within hours</a>. Those orders have to come from somewhere, and with the market already at 50% share, it won’t be just from ICE models…. Yep, Tesla, but also BYD, will suffer.</p>\n<h3><strong>#3 — Geely Geome Xingyuan</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Geely has struck gold with this one</em>. After a number of failed attempts to launch models that would stay in the best sellers table (Galaxy L6, Galaxy E5, etc.), the Hangzhou make finally found the winning formula to not only beat BYD, but also win the leadership race in the fierce Chinese automotive market. With BYD <em>owning</em> most of the market segments, thanks to multiple popular models, the little Xingyuan profited from the fact that BYD was underrepresented in the lower segments, which had left a space between the <em>A to B segment</em> Seagull and the <em>B to C segment</em> Dolphin. With pricing and specs closer to the Seagull, but with an interior space and quality closer to the Dolphin, the small Geely carved out a space of its own, which has been expanding in every passing month. This September, the small hatchback dropped to the last position on the podium, but it still managed once again to continue in <em>record mode </em>(for the ninth month in a row!) thanks to a best ever score of <strong>48,080 units</strong>. Starting with an 80,000 CNY (+/-$11,000) price, the buyer gets a 30 kWh LFP battery from CATL, which is nothing to write home about until you realize that its price is closer to the BYD Seagull’s (70,000 CNY for the 30 kWh version) than the BYD Dolphin’s (100,000 CNY). Exports? Surely that must be on the cards. But first, Geely will need to finish the production ramp-up and satisfy its own internal market.</p>\n<h3><strong>#4 — BYD Qin Plus (BEV+PHEV)</strong></h3>\n<p>The <em>old dog</em> once again joined the top 5 in September, thanks to <strong>39,132 registrations</strong>, a rather good performance. Its sales stayed essentially flat (+1% YoY), and it was once again the best selling BYD on the table. In the same period, its <em>brother in arms</em>, the Song, was down to less than half of last year’s sales! By the way, this was the second consecutive month without any BYD representative on the podium. Troubles ahead for the Shanzhen make? Back to the Qin’s performance, this volume meant that it was the best selling sedan in China, <em>all powertrains counted</em>. The 7-year-old body might be showing some wrinkles, but the low prices still provide significant demand for the sedan.</p>\n<h3>#5 — BYD Sealion 06 (BEV+PHEV)</h3>\n<p>BYD’s new midsize crossover scored <strong>30,532 registrations</strong>, which was a good performance considering it was only its second full month on the market, and allowed it to win its first top 5 standing, no doubt the first of many. But with the BYD Song apparently going into <em>EV Heaven</em> and the Song L failing to live up to the predecessor’s career, will the Seal 06 be the one to replace the Song on the top of the sales charts? It is positioned at around 150,000 CNY (around 22,000 USD) and has the standard BYD qualities of value for money, design and connectivity. On the EV specs side, the PHEV version has an above average 27 kWh battery, and the BEV version’s top battery has an unimpressive 79 kWh. Also, the 800V architecture is a plus at this price point. This means that the Sealion 06 has enough value for money to have a good career, but it will be difficult, if not impossible, to repeat the Song’s three-peat title streak (2022, ’23, and ’24), as the competition is increasingly more competitive and the Sealion 06 lacks standout features and specs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362775\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1909\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1381px) 100vw, 1381px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png 1381w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-579x800.png 579w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-768x1062.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-1111x1536.png 1111w\" width=\"1381\"/></a></p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the best seller table, despite not having any representative on the podium, BYD took over of <em>all places</em> between 4th and 10th, with the Seagull (9th) and Song (10th) in unusually low places. While the SUV’s place can be justified by the fact that it is nearing the end of its career, the Seagull’s drop (-47% YoY) is harder to understand.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we have two fresh faces (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haval_Raptor\">Haval Raptor</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_YU7\">Xiaomi YU7</a>) that stayed on the table, and another that <i>just debuted in the top 20, </i>in the form of Changan’s Deepal S05.</p>\n<p>Outside the top 20, we have a number of models landing with a bang this month, with BAIC’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcfox_T1\">Arcfox T1</a> being the most impressive of them, not only because it scored a rare five-digit debut month, 10,096 registrations, but also because it is coming from the BAIC stable. BAIC is an OEM that has been outside the top positions in the past few years but has three Best Selling Model trophies in the bag (BAIC EC-Series in 2017 &amp; ’18 and BAIC EU-Series in 2019).</p>\n<p>The others were the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangchengbao_Ti7\">Fangchengbao Ti7</a>, another rugged SUV coming from BYD’s premium brand, that landed with 8,128 registrations, and the highly anticipated new generation <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPeng_P7\">Xpeng P7</a>, which started its career with a strong 8,104 registrations. All the while, the new generation MG 4 is already starting its career with a strong 11,790 registrations. So, although the new MG hatchback doesn’t look as sharp as the original one, it is already leaping ahead of the early sales results of the first generation. It will be interesting to see how the European market will react to it.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Geely Xingyuan consolidates power</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362765\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yep, looking at the 2025 ranking, the little hatchback seems poised to succeed the aging BYD Song as the best seller in China, and considering current sales trends, it seems the Geely model won’t leave that position anytime soon.</p>\n<p>If this trend gets confirmed and the Xingyuan wins the title this year, it will be a first for the Geely conglomerate, and the end of a three-year reign of the BYD Song. And to think that, up until this year, no model from the <em>Geely mothership</em> had even made it to the podium….</p>\n<p>Segment-wise, this would also be a significant change. After two years of podiums made up entirely of midsize models, 2025 could be the year that small cars regain protagonism on the podium.</p>\n<p>After all, the #3 Tesla Model Y has the tiny Wuling Mini EV just 5,000 units behind it. So, although the US crossover remains the favorite for the bronze medal, it is not impossible that the little city car could end in 3rd. Now, imagine that — two small EVs on the Chinese podium! And people say that small EVs aren’t competitive….</p>\n<p>Also interesting to see in the current standing is that we have four models in the top positions, from four different brands! Hurrah for diversity!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362774\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2023\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1381px) 100vw, 1381px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025.png 1381w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-273x400.png 273w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-546x800.png 546w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-768x1125.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-January-September-2025-1049x1536.png 1049w\" width=\"1381\"/></a></p>\n<p>Further down, there were a few position changes. Despite a <em>so so</em> month in September (it saw its sales drop 15% YoY), the Tesla Model 3 benefitted from a horrible month from the Li Xiang L6 (down 52% YoY) to surpass it and reach the 10th spot.</p>\n<p>Further below, there was good news for BYD, with the Yuan Up climbing two positions in September to #13. But the Climber of the Month was the cute Changan Lumin, which jumped from 18th to 15th position.</p>\n<p>Finally, AITO’s M8 large SUV joined the table at #20.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362768\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1792\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2040px) 100vw, 2040px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png 2040w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-400x351.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-800x703.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-768x675.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-1536x1349.png 1536w\" width=\"2040\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Looking at the overall manufacturer ranking (not just electrics)</strong>, it seems BYD has found the demand ceiling in its domestic market. September was another month in red, as it saw its sales drop by a significant 16% YoY, the third month in a row of significant drops.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, #2 Geely is far from these issues, having seen its sales jump 62% September. This is while most foreign representatives are either stagnating or seeing sales drop. (Most, but not all — Audi was 10th thanks to enviable 11% growth YoY.)</p>\n<p>Above Audi, we have the other highlight of the month — fast-growing Leapmotor was at #9, thanks to almost 60,000 registrations. That’s an 85% jump YoY. The startup is currently at the top of its game, and <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2025/08/18/leapmotor-turns-profitable-h1-2025/#\"><em>now that it has become profitable</em></a>, the Valley of Death is behind the nine-year-old startup. A top 5 position seems not only possible, but likely.</p>\n<p>But Leapmotor’s startup leadership could be short-lived, because there are <em>two</em> unstoppable trains coming from behind Leapmotor. One is called Xiaomi (#15 in September, up 209% YoY), while the other is Xpeng (#19, up 201% YoY). Which one of them will be the best selling EV startup in 2025? Please place your bets.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Auto Brands Selling the Most Electric Vehicles in China</h3>\n<p><strong>Looking at the auto brand ranking for plugin vehicles</strong>, there isn’t much news.

            "title": "New Online Cost Calculator Aims To Rebuild EV Sales In The US",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Following the untimely demise of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, some analysts are taking an optimistic tack. They anticipate that automakers and dealerships will offset part of the loss with better deals and new incentives. That could help send EV sales ticking upwards again, but it’s not so simple. With so many different deals and incentives to choose from, how can prospective EV buyers be sure they get the best car for the money?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nonprofit Has A Plan To Restore EV Sales Momentum</h3>\n<p>To be clear, the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/ev-sales-outlook-bad-ev-charging-stations-good-what-is-going-on/\">collapse</a> of EV sales in October does not bode well for the future, at least over the near term. Rivian and General Motors are not waiting around for the dust to settle, either. According to news reports, both automakers have already started laying off workers at their EV facilities in the US.</p>\n<p>Still, the nonprofit organization Veloz is among those pointing out that the vast majority of current EV owners will stick with electric when they buy their next car. That should help sustain the EV market for the time being, at least to a modest degree.</p>\n<p>In a best-case scenario, EV sales will also get a boost from bargain-hunting gasmobile drivers who are new to the electric experience. These EV-curious drivers can use any number of online tools to figure out if their next car should be electric or not, but Veloz aims to level up the exercise with new resources that provide individual car owners with information specific to their area and driving habits.</p>\n<p>“With these new resources, we’re giving drivers an interactive, trusted way to learn, stay informed, and gain the confidence to make the move to electric,” Veloz Executive Director Josh D. Boone observed in a press statement.</p>\n<p>“Data shows that once drivers make the switch to an EV, they don’t go back to gas cars,” Boone emphasized. “The combination of lower costs, reduced maintenance, and a more enjoyable driving experience makes EVs not just practical but genuinely fun to drive.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">New Tools In The Vehicle Electrification Toolkit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/07/16/43-5-million-ad-campaign-to-boost-ev-sales-in-the-us-hopefully/\">Veloz</a> is not your ordinary EV advocacy group. The organization, which launched in 2017, received $43.5 million from Volkswagen’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=electrify+america+volkswagen\">Electrify America</a> venture earlier this year. The funds were poured into a new public awareness campaign under Veloz’s <a href=\"https://www.electricforall.org/forward\">ElectricForAll.org</a> online portal, which now serves as host for the new EV search tools.</p>\n<p>The main attraction is a new gas and maintenance savings calculator. Aimed at underscoring the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) advantage of EVs, the calculator drills down into specific details relevant to each user.</p>\n<p>“Using highly precise data modeling, the interactive calculator forecasts an individual’s potential fuel and maintenance savings from switching to an EV, based on key real-life variables,” Veloz explains. Those variables include estimated miles of driving per year, type of car preferred, and the cost of gas in a driver’s area. The calculator also factors in the extent to which a driver anticipates using a home charging station or public chargers.</p>\n<p>Veloz also describes two additional tools:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Used EV Finder:</strong> Drivers can enter their zip code in this user-friendly tool to instantly shop and compare used EVs available within a specific budget and geographic location on their device of choice.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>EV Chat:</strong> This AI-powered assistant offers personalized conversations and answers questions about EVs, including topics from budget needs to addressing real-world concerns on what it is like to own an EV in your location.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">A DIY Angle On The EV Sales Recovery</h3>\n<p>As for whether or not any of this will make a difference in EV sales over the coming months, that remains to be seen. Ford and GM are among the automakers planning to introduce more affordable EVs that tip the TCO balance farther over to the side of electric drive, but those models won’t be rolling off the assembly line anytime soon.</p>\n<p>While Ford and GM represent a traditional sales and service model, the US startup Slate Auto is venturing into new territory that could also support an uptick in EV sales.</p>\n<p>Slate aims to attract car buyers in the DIY automotive ecosystem. Earlier this year the company unveiled its first offering, the stripped-down, customizable “Blank Slate” <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/29/slate-autos-new-ev-is-coming-for-your-gasmobile-your-cybertrucks/\">two-door electric pickup truck</a>.</p>\n<p>In the latest development, on October 28, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slate-engages-national-network-of-service-centers-for-accessory-installation-and-service-powered-by-repairpal-302597486.html\">Slate announced</a> that the Yelp-affiliated platform RepairPal will provide its customers with recommendations for certified service centers in their area.</p>\n<p>“Slate’s OEM partnership with RepairPal’s nationwide network of service centers will give Slate customers peace of mind, while empowering independent service shops to provide accessorization and service,” explained Slate COO Jeremy Snyder in a press statement.</p>\n<p>Although Slate encourages its customers to DIY their own customizations, most of them are more likely to seek help, and that’s where RepairPal comes in. “Slate believes that customers deserve the power to customize, accessorize, and repair their own vehicles, backed by the support of RepairPal’s network of highly skilled service technicians,” Slate explains.</p>\n<p>In particular, Slate anticipates that trained staff at RepairPal shops will take care of electrical and battery-related issues. “Over 200 locations across the U.S. are already certified by RepairPal to handle high-voltage repairs on electric vehicles,” Slate notes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Finally, An Affordable Tesla … JK!</h3>\n<p>Of course, no story about EV sales in the US is complete without a mention of industry leader Tesla. The company’s brand reputation is circling the drain alongside the ongoing, Nazi-adjacent antics of <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/10/29/2351082/-Elon-Musk-still-a-big-fan-of-Germany-s-rising-ultra-rightwing-neoNazi-adjacent-party\">CEO Elon Musk</a>, but it still accounts for the biggest single slice of EV sales in the US, at <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/26/im-confused-tesla-hasnt-sold-out-of-cars-yet-in-usa/\">nearly 50%</a>.</p>\n<p>That share may go down as other EV makers edge closer to the more affordable mark of $25,000. Musk teased <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/07/25000-tesla-getting-really-really-close-two-thirds-no-cybertruck-survey/\">a $25,000 Tesla</a> back in December of 2023, but such a creature hasn’t materialized. Though, rumors of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/robyn-denholm-hints-at-cheaper-mass-market-tesla/\">a more affordable Tesla</a> resurfaced again recently.</p>\n<p>The forthcoming car, if it ever comes forth, is known by the codename Project Redwood, which is … an interesting coincidence! Redwood Materials is the name of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/04/4-billion-for-ev-battery-recycling-an-answer-to-the-question-whatever-happened-to-jb-straubel/\">the EV battery recycling</a> startup launched by Tesla cofounder and former CTO JB Straubel.</p>\n<p>In the latest news from Redwood (the battery recycler, not the EV project), the company has just nailed down a Series E funding round of $350 million, with the firm Eclipse in the lead along with other participants.</p>\n<p>“This is a pivotal time for both Redwood and the United States, as curtailment in international supplies overlaps with intense domestic demand growth for these same materials and energy products,” Redwood stated.</p>\n<p>Hmmm … that sounds like an endorsement of the idea that the demand for EVs is not going away. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.</p>\n<p>I<em>mage (cropped): <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/lpo/ev-charging\">Electric vehicles</a> and EV charging station courtesy of US Department of Energy.</em></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><em>By David Morgan, <a href=\"https://www.pluginncw.com/\">Plug-In NCW Newsletter</a></em></p>\n<p>In 2018, we got our first new EV, a Chevy Bolt. We took several family trips to places like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Crater Lake, LA, Denver. Seven years later, we still have that car and we love it. One drawback, though, is the fast charging is very slow. Most EVs are bigger and better for long road trips.</p>\n<p>In 2022, we drove a Tesla Model Y 8300 miles round trip to the Canadian Maritimes. Other than having a few rentals, we were new to Tesla. That trip blew us away with the simplicity, superior performance, and fuel savings. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/09/8300-mile-ev-road-trip-washington-to-canadian-maritimes/\">Here’s a link to that long trip</a>.</p>\n<p>This week we returned from a trip to several national parks and family visits as far east as Washington, DC.

We retraced a portion of our 2022 trip across portions of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Interstate 90 was the first coast-to-coast EV-friendly corridor, completed in 2013. While there are still a few of those original Tesla chargers, which have a limited number of stalls and lower power compared to newer locations, we found so many newer charging locations with more and faster stalls that we rarely used the older ones.</p>\n<p>In Sheridan, WY, we were almost feeling nostalgic at the 4-stall Supercharger where we waited a few minutes for a free plug and then split the power with the car charging next to us. That only happened once. Everyplace else, even with lots of other EVs using the Tesla Superchargers, things are faster than before.</p>\n<p>As far as overnight charging, that’s also better. It was usually easy to find inexpensive motels near the places we wanted to visit with destination chargers on the premises or nearby, many of which cost nothing. On the other hand, with so many more fast chargers now in operation, some of which are also at or across the street from a hotel, you could also imagine not really caring about plugging in overnight during road trips.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362739\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-400x300.jpeg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n<p>Not including the overnight charging, the average length of our charging stops was 17 minutes. This average was skewed by a small number of stops where we ate a meal or shopped and lingered longer than required. Generally, we tried to see if we could clean the windshield, use the restroom, and eat some snacks before the car indicated “you have enough charge to continue your trip.” The car was almost always ready to move on before we were. Similarly, we tried as much as possible not to stop except when the car said we needed to charge, but often we could not wait that long for the next restroom. 500-, 600-, and 700-mile days were even easy peasier than just 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>Although gas is cheaper now than three years ago, going by the national average for gasoline price and consumption ($3.16 and 27 mpg), the hypothetical ICE vehicle would’ve cost $727 for fuel, whereas we paid $499. Not that we could have fit the four of us plus all our stuff in that ICE car, nor would it have carried us along in the smoother, quieter, peppier EV experience we’ve come to expect, etc.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Another Self-Important Middle-Aged White Guy’s Pragmatic Climate Reset",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Another middle-aged white guy is offering a pragmatic climate reset, me. It seems to be the season for it. Bill Gates has pivoted from “zero carbon at all costs” to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/bill-gates-climate-crisis-pivot\">“improve human welfare first.”</a> Tony Blair has decided that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/05/tony-blairs-new-climate-reset-report-promotes-delay-not-action/\">hard climate targets are too idealistic</a> and that a more rational plan is needed. Michael Liebreich is arguing for an <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/liebreich-the-pragmatic-climate-reset-part-i/\">“affordable first 90%”</a> instead of chasing perfection. The language shifts, the presentation slide templates change, and yet here we are, back at the beginning. Everyone is rediscovering practicality, and apparently, we’re supposed to be grateful that reason is back in style.</p>\n<p>So, in the spirit of the moment, I’ll offer my own pragmatic reset. No grand reinvention. No billion-dollar breakthrough that will arrive in 2040. Just a calm review of what a realistic path actually looks like. Call it middle-aged realism, with coffee instead of cocktails, not that I remotely object to a decent cocktail.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the obvious one. Electrify everything. Cars, buses, trucks, furnaces, cooktops, and industrial heat where possible. Electricity is the most efficient energy vector humans have ever used. It doesn’t care what’s spinning the generator blades. When the power grid decarbonizes, everything connected to it decarbonizes. The cleanest watt is the one that never passes through an engine block or a smokestack. This is not theory anymore. The physics are simple, and the economics are lined up behind it.</p>\n<p>Once you commit to electrification, you have to build more renewable generation than you think. Overbuild it. Maybe 25% overbuild, just as every other form of generation except deeply inflexible nuclear has been built knowing it won’t run at maximum capacity. That’s not waste; that’s insurance. Energy abundance makes the transition politically viable because people stop worrying about scarcity. Solar and wind are already the cheapest sources of new energy across most of the planet. More turbines, more panels, fewer excuses. Every gigawatt of extra renewable capacity is a down payment on stability and affordability.</p>\n<p>Then, connect it all. A pragmatic world is an interconnected one. The power of electrons is that they move faster than any fuel train or pipeline. Build continent-scale grids, high-voltage direct-current lines that move energy from where it’s blowing or shining to where it’s needed. North America, Europe, China, and India all have enough geography to smooth out daily variability. The technology exists, and the payback in reliability is enormous. Integration is cheaper than isolation.</p>\n<p>Once you have renewables feeding the grid and wires spanning regions, you need to store what’s left over. This is where real-world pragmatism lives. We already have storage at scale: pumped hydro. It’s old, boring, and works every time. Complement it with batteries where fast response matters and it’s cheap, which is everywhere in this age of cheap cells. Use thermal storage where heat is useful, which once again is all over the place. Don’t fall for the fantasy that a miracle molecule or a new reactor design will solve variability. Storage isn’t exotic; it’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Industry, of course, is the tough nut. Cement, steel, and ammonia account for a large share of global emissions. Yet here too, solutions are visible. Electric arc furnaces are already replacing blast furnaces. Alternative binders and carbon-mineralized concretes are moving from pilot to production. Biomethane direct reduction of iron is TRL 9. Ammonia made from renewable hydrogen is an obvious step. None of this needs to wait for fusion or moonshots. It just needs focus and investment.</p>\n<p>A real reset also includes the land beneath our feet. Plant trees, yes, but more importantly, manage soils intelligently. Restore peatlands, rotate crops, reduce tillage, and build carbon into the ground. Agriculture is both source and sink, and it responds to practical incentives. Nitrogen fixing agrigenetics, drone seeding and spraying, no till agriculture and precision agriculture are basic and proven tech. These aren’t romantic gestures. They are measurable carbon and resilience gains that feed people and stabilize ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Now for the part that economists have been repeating for decades. Price carbon. Stop pretending pollution is free. When we make people pay for what they emit, they emit less. It’s not punishment; it’s math. At the same time, end subsidies and financing for fossil fuels. Every public dollar spent on propping up declining industries is a dollar not spent on the future. If you want to see pragmatism in action, look at where money flows when it’s allowed to find efficiency.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the part everyone avoids talking about. We need to shut down coal and gas plants. Not in theory. In practice. Every megawatt of coal that closes makes space for a cleaner replacement. Every retired gas turbine is a step toward resilience. Create strategic plans for stopping using fossil fuel plants daily that keeps them around for the rarer and rarer occasions when they are needed. That is what real transition looks like: not burning fossil fuels all the time, not press releases.</p>\n<p>And while we’re fixing obvious problems, eliminate the short-lived climate pollutants. The Kigali Amendment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons is the quiet hero of climate policy. It targets chemicals that trap thousands of times more heat than CO2. Deal with methane too, with its 20 to 30 year residence and high global warming potential. Cap high emissions oil and gas leakage. Pivot biomass to biofuels, returning nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) to the soil as they aren’t required for energy for fuels. This is the kind of pragmatic win that rarely makes headlines but matters enormously.</p>\n<p>If you add all of this together, it’s not radical. It’s the same list engineers, modelers, and policy wonks have been building since the early 2000s. It’s what works. It’s affordable, scalable, and politically survivable. Everything else is distraction. Direct air capture sounds exciting, but it’s an energy sink. Nuclear remains a rounding error, even in China’s megaproject for breakfast economy. Small modular reactors are endlessly delayed. Hydrogen for cars is an answer to a question no one is asking anymore. Fusion is always just around the corner, which is another way of saying it isn’t here. Pragmatism means ignoring these glittering VC- and recidivist-funded diversions and sticking to what can actually scale.</p>\n<p>The funny part of this supposed “reset” is that none of it is new. We knew two decades ago that the future was electric, renewable, and interconnected. We knew the same carbon math, the same technology curves, the same physics. What changed is that fashionable voices rediscovered the old truths and gave them new names. Call it the circle of consultancy. This article just restates my short list of climate actions that will work, that haven’t really changed since I first <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/09/29/the-short-list-of-climate-actions-that-will-work/\">published them six years ago</a>, not claiming that they were in any way innovative or unique.</p>\n<p>The current wave of pragmatic climate resets isn’t all equal. Michael Liebreich’s version is by far the most constructive, grounded in data and tempered by hard-won experience. His argument that we should focus on decarbonizing the first 90% quickly, affordably, and politically securely is a useful correction to both ideological purity and defeatism. He still believes in building things, measuring outcomes, and calling out nonsense when he sees it. His “reset” is the most grounded in political and thermodynamic reality, mostly calling for a rebranding and reframing of communication and politics.</p>\n<p>Tony Blair’s reset, on the other hand, feels like resignation wrapped in gravitas. His appeal to realism mostly just licenses delay, offering a soothing vocabulary for staying comfortable. Bill Gates has wandered even further, reframing climate change as something secondary to welfare or health, as if stability in the climate and prosperity for people were separate goals. His new humility toward warming sounds reasonable but quietly lowers the bar. Of the three, only Liebreich’s version still treats pragmatism as forward motion rather than surrender.</p>\n<p>So yes, this is another middle-aged white guy’s pragmatic climate reset. Except it isn’t a reset at all. It’s the same short list I’ve been repeating for years, and the same one many others have been repeating since the beginning of this century. If it sounds new, that’s only because a lot of nonsense has been dominating the airwaves in recent years, hydrogen and SMRs chief among them Pragmatism never went anywhere. It just waited for attention to return. The only real reset is remembering what already works and finally doing it at scale.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Last month, Dr Andrew Forrest announced significant partnerships with BYD, Longi, and Envision to fight against climate change. He was in New York, attending the UN and taking part in New York’s climate week. Dr Forrest is an Australian billionaire and the non-executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group. You can read about his call for “net zero” and some of the practical steps he has taken <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/12/09/steps-to-achieving-real-zero-at-fortescue/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortescue.com/en/articles/fortescue-unites-worlds-best-technology-and-manufacturing-to-accelerate-decarbonisation-globally\">He declares</a> that the fight against the catastrophic impacts of climate change requires collaboration between countries, industries, and economic sectors. He is pushing for partnerships that will accelerate industrial decarbonisation by building an energy system that “outcompetes and out prices fossil fuels.” And he is doing it in an industry which has long been declared hard to decarbonise. “You can’t do that!” “Yes, we can!”</p>\n<p>“The fight against climate change cannot be won by one country, one company or one continent alone. It requires collaboration across borders, supply chains and industries.” </p>\n\n<p>By 2030, Fortescue is aiming to reach real zero, by “linking the Pilbara’s world-leading operational expertise, America’s and Australia’s research and development strength, the UK’s and Europe’s innovation and engineering excellence and anchoring it all with scale and cost-efficient manufacturing capability in China and the US. Together, this creates a powerful multilateral network of commercial cooperation to accelerate decarbonisation and defeat mankind’s greatest threat — global warming.”<br/>Fortescue is partnering with BYD — not just the world’s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, but also of batteries and energy storage systems. While BYD will supply energy storage solutions, Longi is one of the world’s largest solar technology companies and will supply its photovoltaic modules and solar technology. Solar has proven itself to be the lowest cost form of green energy generation. Envision will supply advanced wind turbine technologies for diverse energy sources.</p>\n<p>These power sources will recharge battery electric haulage trucks supplied by XCMG of China and Liebherr of Germany. Liebherr’s T 264 trucks are already helping to decarbonise Fortescue’s mining fleet in Virginia in the United States. XCMG is expected to supply up to half of Fortescue’s future fleet of 300 to 400 zero-emissions 240-tonne haul trucks from 2028 to 2030. Liebherr is expected to provide the other half of the fleet, as well as electric excavators from its manufacturing facilities in the USA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortescue.com/en/about-fortescue/our-story\">Fortescue Zero</a> delivers technology solutions through world leading research utilising the Colorado Technology Hub in the United States, advanced technology collaborations with CSIRO in Australia and its R&amp;D centre at Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Spanish company Nabrawind will supply Fortescue with its innovative self-lifting tower design. This design facilitates turbines (to be supplied by Envision) to be installed at greater heights (up to 188 metres) in the Pilbara (Western Australia), capturing stronger winds and generating more power. Fortescue has acquired 100 percent of Nabrawind. Envision will supply its EN 182-7.8 MW turbines for Fortescue’s inaugural wind project. These turbines are engineered to perform in a full range of wind conditions, from low wind to cyclonic conditions. The first turbine is slated to be installed next year.</p>\n<p>A recent study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.preventionweb.net/news/worlds-largest-fossil-fuel-and-cement-producers-are-responsible-about-half-intensity-recent\"><em>Nature</em></a> attributed deadly extreme heat events to carbon emissions generated by 180 of the world’s largest fossil fuel and cement producers. One of the takeaways from the report is that “source attribution could help power litigation…. Some of these extreme heat events would have been virtually impossible without climate change,” the researchers at the university ETH Zurich in Switzerland have concluded. A previous study suggested “that 111 carbon majors are responsible for $28 trillion in global economic losses stemming from extreme heat over the period 1991 to 2020.”</p>\n<p>Researchers Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin state: “If you have made contributions to emissions, you have made contributions to extreme heat.” Lawsuits are currently underway. </p>\n<p>While not an emitter at this level, Fortescue is aiming to be part of the solution, not the problem. Fossil fuel reliant industries face growing legal, regulatory, financial, and reputational risks. The need for practical decarbonisation is urgent. I see the work of Fortescue as not only progressing its own growth and profit but also setting an example for other “hard to decarbonise” mining industries. See <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/27/rio-tinto-goes-its-own-way-with-renewable-energy/\">the recent <em>CleanTechnica</em> article about Rio Tinto’s efforts</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortescue CEO Dino Otranto says Fortescue is making progress in its bid to cut the 900 million litres of diesel it uses per year. Rapidly changing technologies give Otranto hope that “real zero” can be achieved by 2030. “(We can) demonstrate to the world that this is about economics, not just climate change.” After all, the Pilbara receives over 3000 hours of sun a year. This will enable the production of iron ore with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. Fortescue has not yet given up on green hydrogen to make green steel, but still has to solve the problem of expensive electrolysers. You can <a href=\"https://reneweconomy.com.au/energy-insiders-podcast-fortescues-bold-charge-to-real-zero-by-2030/\">hear the full interview with Otranto here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll let Dr Forrest have the last words: “The world once benefited from open trade and cooperation — now it is divided. Fortescue is showing that industry can help glue back that multilateral spirit, not through rhetoric but through practical alliances that prove heavy industry can follow a new path — one where profits rise as emissions fall.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“China is scaling and manufacturing green technologies at unprecedented speed and our partnerships give Fortescue access to that capability. Meanwhile, through Nabrawind in Spain, Liebherr in Germany and the United States, Fortescue Zero in the United Kingdom, and Fortescue operations in the Pilbara in Western Australia, we are building a global R&amp;D and production network.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“This is a truly multilateral collaboration that draws on the best ideas and manufacturing capacity to deliver the lowest cost energy and tackle climate change. By joining forces across continents, we are seizing the full extent of the decarbonisation opportunity and rebuilding the cooperation the world needs to address the climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>Thank you, Fortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr Andrew Forrest AO.</p>\n</div>",

The additional tariff was intended to support the US, which also imposed a 100 percent additional tariff on Chinese cars to protect the US auto industry.</p>\n<p>Carney’s itinerary will take him to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. Along the way, he will attend the ASEAN Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, that begins on October 31. He is said to be seeking to establish a “strategic relationship” with China while also aiming to hold talks with Chinese leaders during the APEC summit, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/carney-hopes-to-meet-china-s-xi-soon-in-bid-to-ease-trade-tensions\">Bloomberg</a></em>.</p>\n<p>A press officer for Carney said the prime minister believes firmly in talking to everyone as he seeks new strategic partnerships for Canada. He has been clear about areas in which China and Canada can and cannot cooperate. His goal is to further Canada’s interests and build out good opportunities for Canadian industries.</p>\n<p>Carney met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in New York last month and the two committed to continued engagement, including at the “highest levels” of government. The G20 Summit in South Africa in late November will be another opportunity for Carney and Xi Jinping to meet, an official told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>\n<p>While he is in South Korea, Carney will meet with President Lee Jae Myung to discuss opportunities for collaboration in critical minerals, energy, and defense. He will also attend a working dinner with Australia’s Anthony Albanese and New Zealand’s Christopher Luxon.</p>\n<p>There are also plans for Carney to visit the Hanwha Ocean submarine manufacturing facility. Canada is considering awarding a multi-billion-dollar contract to the Korean company while also exploring a bid by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems backed by Germany and Norway. Defense ministers from those two nations traveled to Ottawa recently to make their case to Carney and Canadian officials. A nation just south of Canada also manufacturers submarines, but for some reason, Canada is not looking to source its new boats from that country.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">China Retaliates On Tariffs</h3>\n<p>To counter the Canadian <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/13/tariffs-are-a-distraction-the-end-of-globalization-is-a-myth/\">100 percent tariff</a> on Chinese made cars and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum form China, the government of Xi Jinping has imposed punitive tariffs on Canadian canola, seafood, and pork.</p>\n<p>Carney has pushed to improve relations with Beijing. Canada’s foreign minister visited the Chinese capital to meet with her counterpart earlier this month. But Carney faces a challenge in trying to improve relations with China while delicate trade talks with the US are ongoing. The US is Canada’s largest trading partner by far.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">A Staunch Ally No More</h3>\n<p>Canada has been a staunch ally of the United States for over a hundred years. When the US was trying to exit Vietnam, Canadian troops helped stabilize that country until after US troops were withdrawn safely. When the US decided to invade Kuwait or Iraq, Canadian forces stood shoulder to shoulder with their US counterparts.</p>\n<p>All that changed when the Fat Felon installed himself and his coterie of sycophants in the White House last January. The Moron of Mar-A-Loco immediately started shooting his mouth off about Canada becoming the 51st US state — by force if necessary. Since then, Canadians have learned the US is not to be trusted. Carney and his administration were shocked to find that the US was <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/02/the-effect-of-tariffs-on-the-auto-industry-its-not-just-ev-manufacturers-that-are-hurting/\">now a sworn adversary</a> and all those decades of friendly relations were just a distant memory.</p>\n<p>Carney has focused on finding new trading and political partners for Canada. This latest rumor, first reported by Chinese news source <a href=\"https://www.thewirechina.com/2025/10/26/canada-set-to-side-with-china-on-evs/\"><em>The Wire China</em>,</a> will be a severe blow to whatever friendly relations remain between the US and Canada, if true.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Canada &amp; US Cross-Border Cooperation</h3>\n<p>For generations, GM, Ford, and Chrysler have operated factories in Canada, primarily in and around Windsor, Ontario, which is just across the Detroit River from Detroit. In practice, many components that go into the vehicles sold by those companies in the US are imported from Canada. Engines and transmissions in particular are often manufactured in Canada for the Big Three.</p>\n<p>In fact, thanks to the free trade agreements between the two countries, the body of a new car may be stamped out in Detroit, then sent to Canada for the engine and transmission to be installed, then sent back to the US for the seats and interior to be added, then shipped back to Canada for other components to be included, before returning to the US one last time before the finished car is shipped to a dealer.</p>\n<p>David Booth, writing for Canadian online blog <em><a href=\"https://driving.ca/column/motor-mouth/canada-chinese-ev-electric-vehicle-tariff-mark-carney-trump-auto-industry\">Driving</a></em>, has some thoughts on the rumors about Canada reducing tariffs on Chinese made cars. He urges Carney and company not to eliminate the 100 percent tariff entirely, as doing so could devastate what is left of the Canadian auto manufacturing industry.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The EU Model</h3>\n<p>Instead, he suggested that Canada should follow the path chosen by the European Union, which imposes <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/06/19/push-for-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-in-brazil-as-byd-comes-to-town/\">tariffs</a> based on how much of a subsidy each manufacturer has received from the Chinese government, according to the EU. He thinks the Canadian International Trade Tribunal could handle that task expertly and expeditiously. At the present time, BYD is subject to a 17 percent tariff in the EU, while SAIC — which refused to cooperate with the European Commission — pays that top rate of 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>The Canadian tariffs should be “high enough that Chinese-sourced cars would not run roughshod over our own local industry — the Detroit Three as well as Honda and Toyota — yet be sufficiently competitive that it would put a scare into the [so-called US president],” Booth said.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Will US Customers React?</h3>\n<p>Just imagine what the reaction will be when US new car buyers learn that Canadians can purchase <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/05/tariffs-electric-cars-bloomberg-says-its-time-to-welcome-chinese-cars-to-the-us/\">competitive electric cars</a> from BYD, XPENG, NIO, and others for less money than they are paying for the highly polluting vehicles Detroit is offering! There is always the possibility that one or more of those Chinese companies may decide to build factories in Canada — literally within sight of the US border.</p>\n<p>The pudgy potentate will learn soon enough that he may have signed a death warrant for the US automotive industry with all his bombast and bluster, and all because he surrounds himself with know-nothing ideologues who have no actual experience running businesses in the real world. He thinks all it takes to govern is to run around shouting “You’re fired!” at the top of his lungs. There’s actually quite a bit more to it than that, as he will learn one day soon to his sorrow.</p>\n</div>",
