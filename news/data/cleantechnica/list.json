            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The Volkswagen brand has reached another milestone in its electric vehicle journey. It has just delivered its 2 millionth fully electric vehicle. The milestone vehicle was a Volkswagen ID.3 produced in Volkswagen’s Zwickau factory, and then was delivered today to a customer at the company’s Transparent Factory in Dresden, Germany.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368930\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1248\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million.jpg 2400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million-400x208.jpg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million-800x416.jpg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million-768x399.jpg 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/VW-EV-Sales-2-Million-2048x1065.jpg 2048w\" width=\"2400\"/></a></p>\n<p>While BYD sold more than 2 million pure electric vehicles last year, and Tesla approached 2 million sales a year at its peak, not a lot of auto brands have gotten to the same 2 million cumulative EV sales as Volkswagen.</p>\n<p>“Volkswagen has assumed a leading role in the European BEV market with its broad range from the compact <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.3</span> to the long-distance capable <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.7</span>,” Volkswagen says. Is it tooting its own horn? Yes. But is it true? Yes.</p>\n<p>“Two million all-electric vehicles provide clear evidence of the attractiveness and competitiveness of our all-electric portfolio,” added Martin Sander, Volkswagen Board Member for Sales, Marketing and After Sales. Indeed.</p>\n<p>Now, the part that Volkswagen bragged about that I don’t think is so exciting is that Volkswagen sold its first EV in 2013, 13 years ago! “Volkswagen started its electromobility journey back in 2013 with the launch of the e-up!, and has been systematically expanding its all-electric portfolio ever since. The two million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) supplied therefore include not only models from the current <span class=\"nowrap\">ID. family</span>, but also electric precursors such as the e-up! and the e-Golf.” I actually drove the e-up! and e-Golf back in 2013. It’s wild to think it’s been that long. And when I do think that Volkswagen has sold 2 million EVs from then to now, it does sound impressive. Let’s just hope the next 2 million come much faster.</p>\n\n<p>The good news — or better news — is that Volkswagen has become a leading EV seller, in Europe and even globally. “Volkswagen has now taken on a leading position in all-electric vehicles in Germany and throughout Europe, and is among the highest-volume providers. The Volkswagen brand is also one of the largest electric car manufacturers in the world,” the company emphasizes.</p>\n<p>“We laid the foundations for electromobility early on and are driving our transformation to an all-electric future with clear strategic priority. Our strong market position, particularly in Germany and Europe, confirms the attractiveness and competitiveness of our electric portfolio,” Sander added.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen also noted that three electric vehicle models in particular have driven many of the brand’s EV sales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">ID.3</span> (approx. 628,000 vehicles delivered):</strong> The <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.3</span> was the first model based on the modular electric drive matrix (MEB) and marked Volkswagen’s entry into the new era of electromobility. It was the first model in the <span class=\"nowrap\">ID. family</span> in 2020 and made all-electric mobility accessible to a broad range of customers in the compact class for the first time. A further product upgrade of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.3</span> will soon be launched.</li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">ID.4</span> (approx. 901,000 vehicles delivered*):</strong> The <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.4</span> is a key growth driver for the brand and has played a major part in expanding Volkswagen’s presence on the global BEV markets. Apart from Germany and other European countries, the most important sales markets for the SUV model include China and the United States.</li>\n<li><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">ID.7</span> (approx. 132,000 vehicles delivered):</strong> Volkswagen expanded its portfolio in 2023 to include an all-electric saloon, followed by an estate (<span class=\"nowrap\">ID.7</span> Tourer) in the upper mid-range segment. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ID.7</span> represents the technological progress of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ID. family</span> and demonstrates how Volkswagen is introducing electromobility to a new segment with long range and a high level of efficiency and comfort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yup, that’s more than 1.6 million vehicles from just those three models.</p>\n<p>All of that said, the future should be even brighter, and more electric. Volkswagen is about to bring a cheaper mass-market EV model to the world, the ID. Polo. And that won’t be the only new EV model. In fact, four new electric car models in the small car and compact segments are being launched by Volkswagen in 2026. “These new models make electromobility accessible to even more customers,” said Sander. “Our aim is to introduce attractive, affordable electric vehicles for everyday use into the high-volume small car segment and, in so doing, take the next growth steps in our transformation.”</p>\n<p>It’s great to see Volkswagen hitting the 2 million EV milestone, but I really look forward to seeing it reach 2+ million EV sales a year.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "How Europe Can Meet Hydrogen Fuel Mandates Without Hydrogen Fuels",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>When I published my recent piece on Germany’s bid to <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/19/germanys-bid-to-double-hydrogen-fuel-targets-ignores-operator-demand-and-cost-signals/\">double hydrogen-based fuel targets</a> to try to justify already built and already stranded hydrogen infrastructure, readers raised important questions about compliance mechanics. One pointed out that the 1% RFNBO subtarget can be met by replacing grey hydrogen in refineries rather than putting hydrogen directly into vehicles. Another noted that renewable electricity supplied to electric vehicles can generate credits that help meet transport renewable energy obligations. Both comments go to the heart of the issue. The question is not only whether hydrogen makes economic sense in transport, but how the regulation actually allows EU member states to comply.</p>\n<p>RED III—the EU’s binding 2030 renewable energy directive setting sector-specific targets for clean energy deployment across power, heat, and transport—Article 25 requires that by 2030 at least 5.5% of energy supplied to transport comes from advanced biofuels and RFNBOs combined, with at least 1% specifically from RFNBOs. RFNBOs are renewable fuels of non-biological origin. In practice this means renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels that meet lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction thresholds of at least 70% relative to fossil comparators. The target is framed as an energy share, not a technology mandate, and it is embedded within national fuel supplier obligation systems.</p>\n<p>The first compliance pathway is direct use of RFNBOs in transport. This includes hydrogen supplied to fuel cell vehicles and synthetic fuels such as e-methanol or e-kerosene used in internal combustion engines or aviation. On paper this is the cleanest interpretation of the rule. A kilogram of renewable hydrogen contains roughly 120 MJ of lower heating value energy, or 0.12 GJ. If delivered at €12 per kilogram—hydrogen is retailing at refueling stations at prices between €10 and €20 in early 2026, with the median under €15, so this is a generous price point—, that is €100 per GJ. By comparison, diesel at roughly €1.50 per litre equates to about €42 per GJ of fuel energy. Retail electricity for depot charging at €0.20 per kWh equates to about €56 per GJ before drivetrain efficiency. A battery electric truck converting 88% of input energy to motion delivers useful energy at roughly €64 per GJ. A modern diesel truck converting about 43% of fuel energy to motion delivers useful energy at roughly €97 per GJ. A fuel cell truck converting about 55% of hydrogen energy to motion would deliver useful energy at roughly €182 per GJ if hydrogen costs €100 per GJ. Hydrogen has to be far cheaper than any retail pump available hydrogen available today or electricity has to be much more expensive in order for hydrogen to only be twice the cost per kilometer of battery electric. The arithmetic explains operator reluctance.</p>\n<p>The second pathway, and one highlighted by readers, is the refinery route. Renewable hydrogen can replace grey hydrogen used in hydrocracking and desulfurization in oil refineries or biofuel upgrading. Grey hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming emits roughly 9 to 10 kg of CO2 per kilogram of hydrogen. Replacing that with renewable hydrogen reduces refinery emissions. Under national transposition of RED rules, the renewable hydrogen input can generate compliance credits toward the transport RFNBO subtarget, even though the final fuel sold at the pump is conventional petrol or diesel. The hydrogen becomes an upstream decarbonization input, and its cost is blended into the refinery’s output fuels.</p>\n<p>Under RED, advanced biofuels are defined primarily by feedstock rather than processing method. They are fuels produced from the waste and residue streams listed in Annex IX Part A, including agricultural residues such as straw and corn stover, forestry residues, sawdust, manure, sewage sludge, non-recyclable biological municipal waste, algae, lignocellulosic material, and other non-food cellulosic inputs. These fuels must meet lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction thresholds, generally at least 65% to 70% relative to fossil fuel comparators depending on plant commissioning date. I started on a global assessment of harvestable waste biomass and the volumes of biofuels that could be delivered from them a couple of months ago, but have been distracted by more pressing research.</p>\n<p>Crop-based biofuels such as ethanol from corn or biodiesel from rapeseed do not qualify as advanced biofuels and are subject to separate caps, typically limited to 7% of transport energy for EU bunkering. Not for the rest of the world, which has a rather different perspective on allowing the agricultural industry to sell its products more freely. Annex IX Part B includes used cooking oil and certain animal fats, which can count toward renewable transport targets but are often treated differently and capped due to supply constraints, something the market and emerging verification standards are dealing with outside of the EU. The core principle is that advanced biofuels under RED are derived from waste, residue, and non-food feedstocks with lower indirect land use change risk and demonstrable greenhouse gas savings.</p>\n<p>This route changes the economics and the optics. Instead of asking motorists to buy €200 per GJ synthetic fuels, the system spreads the additional cost of renewable hydrogen across a large fuel volume. If a refinery processes 10 million tons of crude per year and consumes 100,000 tons of hydrogen, replacing that hydrogen at a premium of €5 per kilogram would imply €500 million in additional annual cost. Spread over roughly 400 million GJ of fuel output, that is about €1.25 per GJ, or around €0.04 per liter of petrol equivalent. That is politically manageable. It is also very different from building a national hydrogen refueling network.</p>\n<p>It’s also a potential additional carbon tax on road fuels, increasing the economic pressure to electrify instead. However, strategically it would be only reasonable to apply it to refineries likely to survive the massive coming cull due to being suitable for petrochemical manufacturing or biofuel refining. It’s unlikely that a refinery that isn’t going to survive would bother.</p>\n\n<p>The third pathway is production and use of synthetic fuels derived from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2. E-methanol contains about 20 MJ per kilogram. At realistic plant gate costs above €3 per kilogram, an order of magnitude higher than fossil methanol, that equates to €150 per GJ before distribution and taxes. Synthetic fuels won’t make sense even in aviation and shipping where alternatives are limited because they will be significantly more expensive than biofuels and batteries. In road transport, they will be multiples of the cost of battery electric options on both efficiency and cost.</p>\n<p>The fourth pathway involves renewable electricity supplied to electric vehicles. RED allows renewable electricity used in transport to count toward transport renewable energy targets, and member states implement crediting systems for electricity supplied to charging infrastructure. If a charging operator supplies 100 GWh of renewable electricity annually, that is 360,000 GJ of renewable transport energy. In credit-based systems, those GJ can offset obligations that would otherwise require advanced biofuels or RFNBOs. If renewable electricity credits are cheaper to generate than renewable hydrogen credits, fuel suppliers will prefer them. In practical terms, doubling the RFNBO subtarget could increase the value of renewable electricity credits and drive more investment into charging infrastructure rather than hydrogen fueling, something that commenters pointed out as a potential upside.</p>\n<p>There are also flexibilities such as multipliers and statistical transfers between member states. In earlier iterations of RED, certain fuels counted more than once toward targets. While the 1% RFNBO subtarget is defined in physical energy terms, member state accounting practices and credit trading systems can lower the effective physical volume of RFNBO molecules required domestically. Compliance becomes a matter of credit optimization rather than molecule flows.</p>\n<p>When these pathways are viewed together, the physical amount of hydrogen that must be delivered into vehicle tanks to meet the 1% subtarget—which the EU is far from on track to meet—may be far smaller than headline interpretations suggest. A member state could likely meet all of its RFNBO obligation through biofuel treatment with green hydrogen, refinery displacement of gray hydrogen and renewable electricity vehicle charging credits, with no deployment of hydrogen vehicles. That outcome aligns with operator demand signals. Fleet managers buy trucks based on total cost of ownership. Surveys by German research institutes show battery electric trucks are preferred when charging access is available. Hydrogen rail projects in several Länder have been scaled back in favor of battery multiple units. The market is voting with capital.</p>\n<p>This brings the discussion back to Germany’s push to double RFNBO targets. Doubling the subtarget from 1% to 2% would increase the nominal requirement for renewable hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels. It would not change the underlying cost differential between hydrogen and electricity. Member States facing higher obligations would look for the lowest-cost compliance routes available within the rules.</p>\n<p>Policy design matters. If targets are raised without tightening rules around credit substitution—something to be hoped for—, the likely outcome is more refinery hydrogen substitution and more renewable electricity credit generation. That reduces refinery emissions and accelerates EV deployment, both of which are positive developments. It does not validate a broad buildout of hydrogen fueling infrastructure for road transport. The arithmetic continues to favor direct electrification for most light and medium duty vehicles and an increasing share of heavy duty applications. Personally, my discovery of the loopholes allowing sensible transportation repowering alternatives to count for RFNBO requirements makes me think that very smart policy makers were working around Germany’s Gruppendenken around hydrogen to pay lip service to it while allowing real decarbonization that made economic sense to proceed more rapidly.</p>\n<p>If Germany succeeds in persuading the EU to double RFNBO targets, the most probable response from member states will be pragmatic. National policies will focus on biofuel processing with renewable hydrogen, incremental refinery upgrades at sites expected to endure as petrochemical manufacturers, and expanded renewable electricity crediting for EV charging. These approaches allow compliance without committing to large scale hydrogen for energy in transport. The risk is not that Europe will be flooded with hydrogen trucks with the attendant major costs. The risk is a softer one that keeps policy debates anchored in a vision of hydrogen as a broad energy carrier, while compliance practice moves quietly toward electrification and selective industrial use. Europe needs to face reality rather than finding ways to creatively comply with fantasy.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Abandoning AI Safety Might Screw Our Cars Up",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>If you do not follow the day-to-day drama of the artificial intelligence industry, you probably missed the news this week.<a href=\"https://time.com/7380854/exclusive-anthropic-drops-flagship-safety-pledge/\"> Anthropic, one of the leading AI labs that built its reputation on safety, quietly dropped its core safety pledge.</a></p>\n<p>To the average person, this probably sounds like inside baseball for tech bros or maybe the beginning of a paranoid article about “ex-risk” (the robots are going to kill us all). But, if you drive a modern electric vehicle or plan to buy one in the next few years, this policy shift is something that’s more likely to crash right into your dashboard.</p>\n<p>Modern EVs are essentially multi-thousand-pound rolling supercomputers. Right now, every major automaker is in a desperate race to integrate Large Language Models (chatbots) into their infotainment systems and driver assist features. But Silicon Valley’s decision to embrace a “move fast and break things” mentality with AI is going to create a massive divide in the automotive world.</p>\n<p>Giving up on these safety guardrails will force the automotive industry to split into two very distinct, very frustrating camps that make us worse off in their own ways.</p>\n<h3>Camp 1: Incumbent Auto Restricts to the Point of Annoyance</h3>\n<p>Traditional automakers are inherently risk averse. They have decades of experience dealing with massive recalls, liability lawsuits, and federal safety standards. If all of the AI companies drop their liability shields, these legacy brands are going to panic and clamp down.</p>\n<p>If a standalone AI app gives you bad advice, you blame the app. If your dashboard AI tells you the wrong thing about how to handle regenerative braking while taking a travel trailer down a steep grade and you crash, the automaker is the one staring down a massive lawsuit.</p>\n<p>To protect themselves, Incumbent Auto (IA) will heavily “sandbox” their AI integrations with highly restrictive system prompts. Instead of a truly smart, free-thinking co-pilot that can intelligently manage your battery telemetry and route planning, we are likely going to get a heavily restricted voice assistant that’s good at about nothing.</p>\n<p>Instead of getting a voice assistant that can tell you about places to stop that are along your route instead of ten miles behind you, it will be neutered to the point of annoyance, refusing to answer anything beyond what is already printed in the owner’s manual just to avoid legal risk.</p>\n<h3>Camp 2: The Tech Car Bros Throw Caution to the Wind</h3>\n<p>Then you have the other side of the industry. The Tech Car Bros are already as allergic to caution as the incumbents are risk averse. They treat public roads like a Silicon Valley beta test, and they are going to view Anthropic’s pivot as a green light to put “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content\">Mechahitler</a>” into your Tesla and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Tesla, it spent years selling the promise of “Full Self-Driving” only to execute a clever legal switcheroo, rebranding it to<a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/05/21/45-minute-tesla-full-self-driving-supervised-test-drive-3-interventions-video/\"> “Supervised Full Self-Driving.”</a> In my view, it is a brilliant way to shift the liability back to the driver while continuing to push beta software to millions of cars on public streets.</p>\n<p>You also have companies like <a href=\"https://comma.ai/\">Comma.ai</a> in the aftermarket space. While it doesn’t sell an autonomous vehicle system, it does enable drivers to experiment with open source software that does it. This shifts not only supervisory liability to the driver, but development and testing liability as well. Most people take this responsibility very seriously, but there are a few idiots who’ve gotten themselves and other people on the road into serious trouble hacking at the code and removing safeguards Comma built into its software to be good corporate citizens.</p>\n<p>For this group, Anthropic backing away from safety pledges validates the exact “throw caution to the wind” culture either they or some of their users already operate in. If the leading AI labs do not care about guardrails, the Tech Car Bros will just follow what the other bros are doing. We will see beta self-driving software pushed to public roads faster than ever to appease shareholders, prioritizing data collection over proven reliability.</p>\n<h3>Waking the Regulatory Bear</h3>\n<p>The whole reason AI companies signed these voluntary safety pledges in the first place was to keep government regulators at bay. By dropping them, they practically guaranteed that federal agencies are going to step in.</p>\n<p>Right now, the Tech Car Bros might be loving the current administration’s push to <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/av-framework-plan-modernize-safety-standards\">remove regulatory barriers for autonomous vehicles</a>. But the political winds can change rapidly after the 2026 and 2028 elections. When an agency like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration decides to regulate emerging software under a tighter administration, they tend to use a sledgehammer.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the tech bro camp will predictably complain and blame “the libs” for over-regulating when the hammer inevitably falls. But they are not idiots. They know this regulatory backlash is coming, and they are doing it anyway to capture market share today in the hopes of massing a user base ready to fight for them later.</p>\n<p>NHTSA is already deeply skeptical of beta software controlling heavy vehicles. If sweeping AI regulations get passed because the Tech Car Bros push things too far, they will catch the risk-averse Incumbent Auto camp in the crossfire. We could see a future where simple software updates to improve battery thermal management get bogged down in months of bureaucratic red tape simply because the underlying code falls under a new, broad definition of “AI.”</p>\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Silicon Valley might be comfortable moving fast and breaking things, but breaking a line of code on a website is vastly different from breaking the code on a heavy electric truck doing 75 mph down the interstate.</p>\n<p>By backing away from their own guardrails, AI companies are forcing the auto industry into a corner. Half the market is going to annoy you with hyper-cautious, locked-down software, while the other half treats your daily commute like a live science experiment.</p>\n<p>But, the industry doesn’t have to put itself and us through all this hassle. If they’d keep their own voluntary safety and responsibility pledges, we wouldn’t have to worry about automakers and/or the government clamping down.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A claim was made in a youtube video by the internet handle Ziroth.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we get deep into this, I need to explain lithium-ion battery charging. Lithium batteries are charged with a voltage source that is current limited. Confusing? Bear with me. When the battery starts at lowest voltage, the difference between source voltage and battery voltage is large and the source is current limited. The current is the same while the output voltage is changing. Therefore, it is being charged by a current source. Once the battery gets close to the final voltage, the source current starts falling until it gets very low. Then it behaves as a voltage source. You can see it in the voltage and current graphs from VTT in Figure 2. <a href=\"https://idonutbelieve.com/\">Click on the links here to get that</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the curves shown by the Ziroth video above:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368901\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"995\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1998px) 100vw, 1998px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph.png 1998w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph-400x199.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph-800x398.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph-768x382.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Charge-curve-graph-1536x765.png 1536w\" width=\"1998\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He compared a curve that shows voltage versus SOC with a curve that shows voltage versus time. It is bad practice to compare two curves with different parameters. Two curves should be viewed with the same units on both scales. Why? It is general scientific practice. Not yet a crucial problem, but it can sometimes lead to false conclusions. The second curve appears to be from the downloadable VTT report, Figure 2. Its horizontal units are labeled hr, and the text matches hours. Limits are still somewhat observable, more on that later. The second curve shape changes quickly at first, rising suddenly, then slows. What do we know about batteries at low SOC? They charge fast at first, then they slow down. The lithium curve shows the range of cell voltages versus SOC. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first curve is reputed to be lithium-ion by Ziroth, and does look like typical NMC. Now look at the next curve. It is the Donut Labs curve. A lithium battery voltage cannot go too low or too high. If it goes too low for too long, it gets bricked. The battery cannot be used again. If it goes too high, an NMC battery will be damaged or catch fire. Both min and max must be limited. That is, lithium must be limited on the lower limit. Some sources say the particular sodium-ion battery can be fully discharged to zero. The charger does the limits, not the battery. What we get from the curve independent of the charger is the steep rise at the beginning of the charge. That rise tells us we are near 0% SOC. The upper voltage on the right curve is as flat as a board. That upper voltage was limited by the charger, not the battery. When that looks flat, the charging is not increasing battery voltage much any more, but we do not know where we are in an SOC graph. The VTT spec says stop charging when nearing that upper voltage when the current is a given amount.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The cell was charged with a 24 A current until the highest recommended voltage of 4.15 V was reached, followed by a constant-voltage charge with 4.15 V until the current decreased to 1.2 A.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, we can get an </span><b><i>idea </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about what the battery characteristics are like from those limits. We can see the approximate full discharge 0% SOC voltage. It is somewhere in that inflection point from vertical to where it starts to go more horizontal, but that point is not accurately determined. We also cannot tell the exact point where 100% SOC happens. Worse yet, the time to 100% SOC has a lot of variability, because the smaller we make the current limit, the more time it takes. Remember, this is where the current falls slowly. The closer to 100% SOC it gets, the longer time it takes. It’s an exponential relaxation curve like the discharge of a capacitor with resistor. It has a long tail. Because of this, 100% SOC is not a good metric to determine time of charging. The time it takes to stop charging when current decreases to 1.2A could be more if it stopped at 0.12A and it is not linear. That is why I think the statement 5 minutes to 100% SOC is not a real engineering specification. It lacks a condition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That leads us to one more thing. There were many, many statements by more than one person in the Donut Labs video interviews I saw. Which ones are official specs? I don’t know what rigor is made in those statements compared to an engineering specification. That sounds trivial, but it is not. Conditions matter when testing and specifying a product. Without getting tangled up in it too much, I say only the time from 0 to 80% SOC makes any sense to me for 11C testing. That is because the 100% SOC end point is inaccurate and is not specified what the end point is. The 0% SOC point is easier because it does not depend much on time or voltage, only that the charge is near zero. It only requires that the battery be drained. It makes little difference to the charging time measurement exactly how well it is drained. The time to 80% SOC point is relatively well known and we can estimate accuracy. Really, what we want to know is how fast it charges to a reasonably accurate amount of charge, not a perfectly accurate amount. If the charge estimation was off by 5%, the time is only off about that much while the current is constant. That is also because most or all of the charge curve is linear up to that point. It is only after the charge curve is mostly non-linear that the charge time becomes less accurate or predictable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, 100% SOC charge times are not a reasonable method of ascertaining max charging speed or charge rate, C. The spec should be made to a level of SOC other than 100%. If Donut Labs said that, it was not a proper engineering spec. No matter, because the real performance can still be ascertained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a screenshot of a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Bz-u1IrsNb8?si=5NSnZeR5XFTPFJHY\">Ziroth video</a> about CATL’s reinforced sodium-ion battery, a completely different battery chemistry. I wrote about that battery in a <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/01/06/why-the-sudden-emergence-sodium-ion-batteries/\">recent</a></span><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/01/06/why-the-sudden-emergence-sodium-ion-batteries/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> story</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368908\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1461\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-scaled.png 2560w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-400x228.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-800x457.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-768x438.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-1536x877.png 1536w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EV-battery-charging-graph-antimony-2048x1169.png 2048w\" width=\"2560\"/></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look familiar? This one shows SOC reversed, starting from full voltage and discharging toward 0% SOC. The limits are similar if not the same, but it is a sodium-ion battery. They call it a reinforced sodium-ion battery, and it is from a patent I wrote about coming from CATL. They deliberately doped the cathode of a sodium-ion battery to change the curve. It worked. Do you see a major difference in voltage limits? I don’t. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He does say, “this curve is like an electrochemical fingerprint for the cell, and it isn’t something you can just change around depending on the application, at least not from anything I’ve ever seen.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uh-oh. That last statement is an exception. I do agree with him. I never saw two chemistries with nearly identical charge curves before. Until now. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That was at 3:02.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s go back to the Ziroth video. There are too many statements to cover them all. The statement is made, “I now believe it is extremely unlikely to be true and I give it a naught point one chance of being true.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I can say with extremely high certainty, that what we are looking at is a lithium-ion battery.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(at about 2:00)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that, a whole series of conclusions are made by Ziroth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I said, I am loathe to draw a string of conclusions about other matters unrelated to charge time from this limited information. I would make absolutely certain the first statement is true before I dared do that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there is a statement, “Charging times to full are also significantly slower than previously stated.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I said before, I do not consider statements made by Donut Labs during CES to be be engineering specifications. I do not have an engineering specification. Before a target is tested to see if it is met, I have to know precisely what that target is. 100% SOC is not a precise target without an ending current cutoff limit. It is common for semiconductor specifications to include statements of performance that do not have conditions that may be achieved, then in the body of the text, show conditions and guaranteed results. Those are not the same. The independent tester really cannot do accurate tests to 100% SOC. So they showed times to 80% SOC and C rates over that range. The charge to 80% is 4.5 minutes. The charge rate C, in 4.5 minutes to 80%, gives the C rate. If the charge was 100% in 5 minutes, the C rate would be 60/5, or 12. If the charge is less by 0.8 and done in 4.5 minutes, we get 60/(4.5/0.8) = 10.667. The charge rate increases with temperature. The temperature was not specified. It looks as if it might reach 11C if the temperature rises a little higher. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on my experience, manufacturers do not always give accuracy limits for C rate measurements. This meets typical standards. Sorry, the spec we started out with is not a rigorous engineering spec with accuracy limits stated. The test is adequate to support the claims of high charging speed within reasonable accuracy for the time being. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many statements that go beyond charging speed. Since the tests only are designed to measure charging, I refrain from making any statements about other performance metrics based on the tests. Without proper measurements, specs, and conditions, I cannot make firm conclusions. There are more statements, like ones about red flags I will not include. Red flags are not proof. They may mean something, but must be weighed much more carefully and on their own, and cannot be counted on as proof. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a series of statements about cell capacity attempting to determine that. He uses a display battery at CES. Then he says, “Sure they could be testing different cells.” There is no sense in going further. There is no way to  know that the cell presented to independent tests is the same one used in the display. It’s speculation. Then he says he thinks it being a different cell is unlikely? That is not accurate. There should be no conclusion from lack of knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cell was stopped from exceeding 90C. The limit was assumed set by the battery. When you say, “I don’t know why there would be,” it means you do not know what the reason was it was stopped. There is no conclusion from lack of knowledge. Just because the battery test stopped at 90C does not mean the battery has a safety limit at 90C. It might, but the conclusion cannot be made from that yet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It goes on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cells seen expanding? I see something change in some foil across the two tabs. The rest of the battery underneath the foil, I see no movement. There were no measurements of expansion that could be referenced. The statement “I see expansion” is not scientific or accurate. The cell cannot be seen below the foil and there are no efforts to gauge the cell expansion properly. Does not mean it expanded or not. From this test, there is no way to determine how much expansion there is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am going to stop there. I think Ziroth seems to be a reasonably nice, intelligent person. I have no intention of being personal here. It’s not about persons. It is about ideas, and this notion Donut Labs proffers about skepticism. I have my own ideas about engineering and rigor and I have my own conflicts about that, and hold to high standards. When I appear to criticize, keep in mind that I come by it honestly, and it is not about people, but about my excessive desire for accuracy and certainty. Being a design engineer does not always make me the life of every party, at least while I am in that mode. When others make statements or do things that are inaccurate or unsubstantiated, I get antsy. I cannot abide by that kind of uncertainty, so I go to ridiculous extremes to find out. That bugs people, and I know it. Please accept my apologies in advance if my excessive engineering bothers you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s just that others have picked up on this video and then said, “see, Donut Labs’ claims are false.” I cannot absolutely come to conclusions based on limited data that does not absolutely confirm or deny a conclusion. If it does, I will state it firmly. As you can see, I do not think those blurbs and images showing things like minutes to 100% SOC are true engineering specs. If they were, you would see conditions and limits fully specified. A test engineer must have that kind of spec to make a measurement. That is why the independent tester stated 0 to 80% SOC in 4.5 minutes. 80% SOC is determined from the amount of charge from the point it was charged to max voltage to a discharge point where the current dropped off to some limit. He made it an engineering spec. He had to. His test machine demanded the settings because they are real-world settings. Likewise, C rate is not always a tightly specified value with percentage variation limits. I can only say the cell presented to independent testing delivered the performance VTT stated. VTT made their statements. In the video, they also added that the Donut Labs device was better than other solid-state devices they tested because it did not require special clamping methods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand that variation and limits are not given before production in anything but general terms, and if there is something released, it is always accompanied by something that says it is pre-production or the like. That is because those specifications determine yield. You cannot do yield until after the product goes into factory production. You can try for tolerances, but cannot predict them exactly. It depends on both process and design.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can stop now. It is time for a pause and reflection. Truth is not that simple. I cannot make a statement saying Donut Labs failed charging speed tests. There is enough evidence that it performs like its statements say. I would prefer a true engineering spec, but at this level of development, an engineering specification does not make sense. The tests are adequate to determine the truth of the statements for now. It is enough to say Donut Labs’ statements are meaningfully and reasonably correct and accurate enough for now. I can also say that statements concluding that this is a lithium-ion battery are questionable. I will not go further than that except this: If there are two curves that match and the chemistries are different, then Donut Labs’ battery might not be a lithium battery. At least I can say it might be the other curve that seems to match VTT’s test results. Those curves do match a reinforced sodium-ion battery as detailed in a CATL sodium-ion patent and the curves were proffered by Ziroth. But Donut Labs battery energy density is more than the sodium ion. Isn’t that curious. I won’t put $5,000 on it. If you make me do that, I may study it and never come back again. I don’t know anything for sure yet, but it sure is curious. Interested yet?</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1395px) 100vw, 1395px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic.png 1395w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic-400x310.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic-800x619.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Donut-Labs-battery-pic-768x595.png 768w\" width=\"1395\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "What Happens to an EV in a Car Crash!",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>On the 8th January this year, Ron Male was involved in a spectacular car crash. A four-car pileup no less. His BYD Seal was the first in line, followed by three petrol cars — a Great Wall, a Mazda, and a BMW. Looks like the Mazda was the crumple zone! Ron tells me that the drivers gathered ’round and talked about their experience. He told them that his vehicle was a BEV. No one in the group seemed particularly bothered.</p>\n<p>Two fire engines attended. Contrary to expectations, his BYD Seal AWD Performance did not burst into flames. But there was quite a conversation about how to isolate the battery. When the first responders reported that they had achieved that, Ron pointed out that the screen was still clearly ON. “Let me turn my car OFF,” he remonstrated. He tells me that “I simply turned it off, then popped the bonnet to isolate the 84 kW battery.”</p>\n\n<p>“I got a call from the repairer asking me how my rear seat was destroyed. The fire brigade had actually PEELED the seat lining off the frame INSTEAD of lifting the rear seat up to access the battery. I DO honestly believe the fire brigade require FURTHER training on ALL EVs.” My thoughts are that there could be a vast improvement if they received training in just BYD and Tesla, as they are the most common EVs on Australian roads.</p>\n<p>It appears from the photos Ron supplied that as he was slowing down, a Great Wall Haval slowed down to match his speed, but the other two cars, a Mazda and a BMW, clearly did not. The BMW ran up the rear of the Mazda as it rammed into the back of the Haval. Ron’s BYD Seal was the only car not written off.</p>\n<p>The insurance company has spent three weeks thoroughly checking all the wiring before sending the car off for repairs. Ron has nothing but praise for Suncorp Insurance. Though, the ICE loaner car has been driving him crazy. “I could never go back to an ICE vehicle again!” He shared the costs with us: “I’ve always insured my cars, including Holden Special Vehicles, Mercedes AMGs, and now BYD with Suncorp. They have been really excellent telling me what’s happening. Insurance costs AU$1,350 per year with a $700 excess. But I wasn’t at fault. So didn’t pay a cent, naturally.”</p>\n\n<p>The fire brigade attends car accidents due to the possibility of a fire from combustible materials leaking from damaged engines (oil) and petrol tanks. It provokes the thought — what sort of powertrain is the most dangerous when a car is damaged? Petrol diesel, hybrid, or battery electric?</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://electricvehiclehub.com.au/information-centre/is-an-electric-car-safe-in-a-crash/\">Electric Vehicle Hub</a>, every electric vehicle tested in the last five years has received a 5-star ANCAP (Australian New Car Assessment Program) safety rating. ANCAP is “the gold standard of car safety testing.” In fact, EVs are often safer than internal combustion engine cars. For example, they hold “the top three positions in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rollover safety testing. The Tesla Model S came first, followed by the Tesla Model X and Chevrolet Volt joint second.”</p>\n<p>With a lower centre of gravity, they have better, safer handling. No gearbox or engine will intrude into the cabin to damage the occupants. The liquid fuel in an ICE car is only covered in a few millimetres of plastic. An EV’s battery is surrounded by centimetres of metal.</p>\n<p>EVs don’t explode in an accident, that’s what petrol cars do. “AutoInsuranceEZ* (US) looked at American-only data from the National Transport Safety Board, the Bureau of Transport Statistics &amp; Vehicle Recalls from 2020 <a class=\"cGlBi YEMNV\" data-hook=\"web-link\" href=\"https://www.autoinsuranceez.com/gas-vs-electric-car-fires/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to conclude</a>: ‘Hybrid vehicles actually come in number one with the most fires per 100K sales. Gas vehicles are second, and electric vehicles place third, with only 25 fires per 100K electric vehicle sales. Based on this data, electric vehicles don’t catch fire nearly as much as the news claims. Hybrid cars seem to be the most dangerous for fires, followed by gas vehicles,'” <a href=\"https://www.evfiresafe.com/ev-fire-faqs\">EVfiresafe</a> writes.</p>\n<p>Ron shared his story at our recent coffee, cake, and EVs morning and provoked quite a discussion about the need for electric vehicles to have an easily identifiable high-voltage battery isolator switch. And for first responders to be trained in locating and actioning such a switch.</p>\n\n<p>Ron has received word that he should get his BYD Seal AWD Performance back by the 18th March. It will have been in the shop for 2 months and 10 days. He’ll be meeting me for coffee again next week and we’ll see how he is coping with his ICE loaner. His future should be bright and electric.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Volvo Scales Up Electric Heavy Trucks As Profits Fund Zero-Emission Shift",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Volvo Group is channeling its strong profitability and European market leadership into the rapid expansion of battery-electric and other zero-emission heavy trucks, positioning electrification at the center of its decarbonization roadmap for long-haul transport, regional distribution, and mining.</p>\n<p>During the presentation of the full-year and fourth-quarter results for 2025 last month at Tändstickspalatset in Stockholm, President and CEO Martin Lundstedt said the group’s high returns, cash generation, and scale allow it to accelerate investment in electric vehicles and hydrogen-based transport solutions under its multi-pathway strategy.</p>\n<p>Chief Financial Officer Mats Backman told the media and industry analysts present at the conference that it had a net cash position of SEK 63 billion in the industrial operations and a return on capital employed of 25.5 percent, giving the company the financial capacity to expand its zero-emission portfolio while maintaining double-digit operating margins.</p>\n<p>The push comes as Volvo retains about a 19 percent share of the European heavy-truck market for a second straight year, providing the production volumes and service revenues needed to support the transition. That scale is now being used to industrialize battery-electric platforms derived from the company’s long-haul architecture.</p>\n<p>At the center of the shift is the FH Aero Electric, which Volvo is positioning for regional and intercity logistics. The truck uses a new e-axle that integrates electric motors and transmission at the rear, freeing chassis space for additional batteries and raising installed capacity to 780 kilowatt-hours. Under optimal conditions, the configuration delivers a range of up to 600 kilometers. It is designed to operate with the megawatt charging system for heavy vehicles, which can charge the battery from 20 percent to 80 percent in about 45 minutes, aligning with regulated driver rest periods and allowing electric trucks to be deployed on longer routes without disrupting fleet utilization.</p>\n<p>Volvo’s installed base of more than 5,700 battery-electric trucks in 50 countries gives it one of the largest real-world data sets in the heavy-duty segment, shaping vehicle development, charging strategies, and digital fleet services. The growing service business — including connected vehicle monitoring, energy management, and uptime contracts — provides a recurring revenue stream that supports customers shifting to electric operations.</p>\n<p>Beyond highway transport, mining and construction are emerging as early large-scale applications for zero-emission heavy vehicles. In cooperation with Swedish mining group Boliden, Volvo FH Electric trucks are operating in the Kankberg underground mine, where the absence of exhaust emissions improves working conditions and significantly reduces the need for energy-intensive ventilation. The trucks recover energy through regenerative braking when descending into the mine and reuse it for the climb back to the surface, making electric drivetrains particularly efficient in steep and confined duty cycles.</p>\n<p>For open-pit mining and heavy construction, the FMX Electric is designed to handle high payloads on rough terrain, using the instant torque and precise traction control of electric propulsion to move material in environments that have traditionally depended on large diesel engines. These deployments are seen as stepping stones toward broader electrification of off-road and heavy industrial transport.</p>\n<p>Alongside battery-electric vehicles, Volvo is advancing fuel-cell electric trucks for longer distances, where hydrogen can extend range and shorten refueling times while maintaining zero tailpipe emissions. The combination of battery-electric for shorter and regional routes and fuel-cell electric for longer haul is intended to cover the full spectrum of heavy transport as energy infrastructure expands.</p>\n<p>The strategy is aligned with Volvo’s target of offering a fossil-free product range by 2040 and reflects a shift from pilot projects to industrial-scale deployment of zero-emission trucks. With a leading position in Europe and a growing global electric fleet, the company is using its current earnings power to fund what Lundstedt described as the most extensive transformation of its heavy transport portfolio.</p>\n<p>Backman said operating cash flow of SEK 21.9 billion in 2025 allows the group to maintain a high level of research and development spending despite a normalization in vehicle demand compared with the previous year. That financial strength is enabling the simultaneous rollout of new electric platforms, charging partnerships, and digital services tied to energy use and route optimization.</p>\n<p>As this article was being written, the 2025 Annual Report was also revealed. According to the report, the company remained well in the black across all business areas with more efficient vehicles and solutions, even as a cyclical downturn that began in 2024 led to lower volumes for new trucks and machines and geopolitical tensions weighed on the global economy.</p>\n<p>“In this period of weaker demand in our key regions and with increased uncertainty about the future, we focused on what we can impact. We adjusted our operations, applied strict cost control, remained firm on our commercial conditions and continued to develop our service business. Thanks to hard work by colleagues across the Volvo Group and at our business partners along the value chain, the underlying performance remained solid. With our fuel-efficient and competitive lineup of products and services across the business areas, we are well-positioned to capture growth in the next cyclical upturn,” said President and CEO Martin Lundstedt.</p>\n<p>Net sales reached SEK 479.2 billion, down 3 percent year on year on a currency-adjusted basis due to lower vehicle sales, while the service segment posted solid growth. Adjusted operating income totaled SEK 51.2 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 10.7 percent, as higher service revenues helped offset the impact of reduced volumes.</p>\n<p>“I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all colleagues and business partners for yet another year of hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of driving prosperity through transport and infrastructure solutions. Together, we contribute to shaping the world we want to live in with economic growth, increased living standards and a sustainable development of society,” Lundstedt said.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Why Is Hong Kong Ending EV Tax Breaks? Does It Make Sense?",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Hong Kong has a sizable tax break available for electric vehicle purchases, comparable to what the US had before Donald Trump took office and Republicans took control of the US Congress on the low end. It is HK$58,500 (US$7,477), or a whopping HK$172,500 (US$22,047) if you trade in/scrap on old car.</p>\n<p>However, Hong Kong has decided to end this tax break, and March 31, 2026, is the last day you can qualify for it. But why? Is the Hong Kong government Trump-like, wanting to stop all kinds of cleantech progress?</p>\n<p>Nope. It’s just that the Hong Kong EV market is so advanced that this subsidy is no longer seen as needed. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po defended the change in policy by noting that 70% of new vehicle sales in Hong Kong are now EVs, and 16% of all registered vehicles there are. The market should take it from here — that’s the idea, anyway. Perhaps it helps that Chinese EVs have become so competitive in every way now.</p>\n<p>Though, there may be no vehicle sales in the second half of the year, as the craze to buy EVs now is apparently absurd. One car dealer told the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3344754/hongkongers-rush-showrooms-ev-tax-breaks-end-quotas-sell-hk60000\"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> that EV sales had skyrocketed 17 times over following the decision being made at a Legislative Council meeting. Long lines have formed at dealers, and another dealer told <em>SCMP</em> that a man who could not get in before midnight was crying thinking that he had missed his opportunity, only for the dealer to happily explain that he still had until March 31 to buy an in-stock vehicle. <em>Phew</em>.</p>\n<p>The government of Hong Long still intends to phase out fossil-fueled vehicles by 2035.</p>\n<p>The issue critics of the change have is that keeping the tax breaks in place could lead to a fossil fueled vehicle phaseout quicker, and I don’t see how that could be denied. Keep the tax subsidies and phase out fossil fueled vehicles faster. Why decide that 2035 is fine and to soften longstanding policies when you could just phase out polluting vehicles quicker? “One listener on the program, a taxi driver surnamed Lee, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the abrupt cancellation, stating that it greatly reduces the incentive for drivers like him to switch to electric vehicles,” <a href=\"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/hong-kong-news/article/325336/Policy-has-achieved-its-objectives-Paul-Chan-defends-ending-EV-tax-breaks\"><em>The Standard</em></a> reports. Indeed, I don’t get it. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, if you are leading on cleantech adoption, why not keep leading? Why slow down?</p>\n<p>Still, kudos to Hong Kong for being a clear leader in the sector. It doesn’t get much attention, since it’s a relatively small place and so far away from US and European markets. But a 70% EV adoption rate is right up there near the top of the list globally, only trailing Norway as far as I know. And Hong Kong actually has more residents than Norway! The population of Norway about 5.7 million, while the population of Hong Kong is about 7.4 million people.</p>\n<p>Anyway, will EV adoption slow down in Hong Kong? Or is the market so mature that this will hardly register as a blip? We will see.</p>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/steven_yu-2625920/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4370342\">Steven Yu</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4370342\">Pixabay</a></em></p>\n</div>",
