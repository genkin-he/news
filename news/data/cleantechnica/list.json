            "title": "Tesla Extended Vehicle Warranty — Is It Worth It?",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>My Tesla Model Y turns four at the end of November. This week, I got an email from Tesla asking me whether I want to sign up for an <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/03/23/tesla-extended-warranty-for-model-3-model-y-now-an-option/\">extended vehicle warranty</a>. The traction battery and drive units are covered by an 8 year warranty, but all the other stuff is on me if something goes awry after the original vehicle warranty expires. The email read:</p>\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Your Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty is ending soon.</h4>\n<p>“To maintain peace of mind and continue limited coverage for your vehicle, you’re eligible to subscribe to the separate Extended Service Agreement (ESA) — a flexible monthly plan backed by Tesla. ESA helps cover certain unexpected mechanical and electrical repair costs after your original warranty expires. Learn more about what’s covered under Extended Service Agreement.”</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Much Does The Tesla Extended Warranty Cost?</h3>\n<p>The first thing anybody who got that email would want to know is, “How much does it cost?” The answer is $60 a month, or $720 a year. This is a monthly subscription, so it can be cancelled anytime. The maximum coverage period is eight years from the original date of purchase or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. There is also a <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/15/can-you-get-a-warranty-for-a-used-tesla-what-about-a-nissan-leaf-lets-get-some-answers/\">plan for used cars</a> and readers should visit the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/extended-service-agreement#how-eligible\">Tesla website</a> for more information about that.</p>\n<p>In my case, I do plan to keep my Tesla for another four years, so my total cost of the ESA during that time would be $2880. It’s not hard to imagine that, with a car as complex as a Tesla, a repair could easily cost that much. A plus is that the ESA includes roadside service in the event of a breakdown.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is Covered?</h3>\n<p>As far as what is covered, Tesla says, “The monthly ESA subscription covers the repair or replacement necessary to correct the mechanical breakdown or inability to perform the function(s) for which it was designed of most parts manufactured or supplied by Tesla during the coverage period under normal use. Coverage takes effect on the date that your original New Vehicle Basic or Pre-Owned Vehicle Limited Warranty expires. The ESA subscription also covers Tesla Roadside Assistance, which provides you with immediate roadside services, 24/7 365 days a year.”</p>\n<p>Are there any downsides? The ESA agreement says, “The Owner’s Manual includes specific recommendations regarding the use, operation, and maintenance of the Vehicle. You must follow correct operation procedures and have Your Vehicle serviced as recommended by Tesla.” That probably leaves me out, as the last time my Model Y saw a Tesla service center was the day I drove it home.</p>\n<p>Nothing has gone wrong with the car and the idea of taking a day out of my life to drive 60 miles to the nearest service center to cool my heels while I wait for the annual maintenance process to be completed and then drive 60 miles home didn’t make much sense to me. So I guess I am out of luck on that score. Although, Tesla might relent on that if I am willing to have the car inspected by them at one of their service centers before the agreement is activated — at my expense, of course.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Arbitration Clause</h3>\n<p>In addition, the <a href=\"https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/vehicle_extended_service_agreement_en_us.pdf\">ESA contract</a> states that any disputes must be submitted to binding arbitration, which means you can’t sue Tesla. To be fair, the agreement does say the arbitration process will take place near the owner’s home jurisdiction and will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association, a recognized organization with an excellent reputation.</p>\n<p>These types of agreements used to be called contracts of adhesion, because one party has virtually no ability to negotiate the terms. To be legally enforceable, a contract should represent an agreement between two or more parties in which everyone has the power to shape the final agreement. The owner in this case has zero negotiating power, which a court could rule makes the contract unenforceable. But as a practical matter, arbitration is much less costly and burdensome than going to court and it is not like Tesla is picking the arbitrator.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Exclusions</h3>\n<p>Under General Provisions, the ESA contract states: “The ESA does not cover Your Vehicle’s HV Battery, LV Battery, and Drive Unit, among other items identified in Section F, Exclusions.” The traction battery and drive unit are covered under a separate eight year warranty. Most of the exclusions are sensible stuff and include parts that typically wear out in normal service — brakes, rotors, shocks, wipers, bulbs, and the like.</p>\n<p>One thing owners should be aware of is language that says that if some non-Tesla part gets installed by you or a non-Tesla service center and that part leads to a failure of some other component or the car, coverage is void. Now, I understand that. From Tesla’s point of view, its cars are computers on wheels and every component must work seamlessly with the wiring and voltage requirements of those computers.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: If you are 1,000 miles from home in the pouring rain and something goes kablooey with your Tesla, are you going to let the local Pep Boys or similar service operation fix it so you can get back on the road, or are you going to have your car towed to a Tesla service center three counties away and hope they can squeeze you in? If you choose the former, you may be compromising your coverage under the ESA.</p>\n<p>If you get a wiper motor from a salvage yard and it doesn’t play nicely with the rest of the car’s wiring, should Tesla be responsible? Arguably not. Still, anyone who takes the time to read the ESA in its entirety (I did, until my eyes started to glaze over) may get the impression that there are lots of opportunities for Tesla to say, “Sorry, that’s not covered under your warranty.” If that happens, you have very little opportunity to negotiate and your options are extremely limited.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Feedback From Other Owners</h3>\n<p>I reached out to my son in law who has a Model Y that is now 5+ years old. Recently, he had some squeaks in the front suspension, so he took it to the local Tesla service center, which happens to be just a few miles from his home. It was determined that some suspension pieces needed to be replaced. The cost was less than he would have spent for an extended warranty to that point. He told me he plans to forego the ESA and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>I also spoke with Zachary Shahan, the ringmaster of the <em>CleanTechnica</em> flying circus, who told me the same thing. “I thought about it a lot, wrote articles about it to get reader feedback to help make the decision, but in the end I decided to bet/hope on the car not breaking down enough to make it a smart financial decision.” Zachary did a <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/07/18/is-the-tesla-model-3-extended-warranty-worth-the-cost/\">similar piece</a> about the Tesla extended warranty program two years ago, four months after writing about <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/03/23/tesla-extended-warranty-for-model-3-model-y-now-an-option/\">its introduction</a>. [Extra note from Zach: Back then, it was going to cost me $1,800 for another two years of warranty and would cost someone with a longer range vehicle like Steve’s $2,000, whereas, as Steve notes, there is now the option to pay monthly and the total for Steve over two years would be only $1,440 (or $2,880 over four years). So, it is clearly a better deal now. However, the overall pros and cons are the same.]</p>\n<p>I spent many years working in car dealerships and am somewhat familiar with extended warranties. They tend to be quite specific about what is covered. The Tesla ESA is specific about what is not covered but rather vague about what is. That seems to me to give the company a lot of power when the manager of a Tesla service center tells you your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag\">turbo encabulator</a> is not covered.</p>\n<p>In essence, all extended warranties are little more than a form of betting. The companies are betting they will take in more money than they pay out, while owners are betting just the opposite. I only signed up once for an extended warranty. That involved a used Honda Civic and I was able to negotiate a lower price for the coverage with the guy in the finance office. In that case, I won the bet.</p>\n<p>I have made my decision about whether to accept Tesla’s offer to enter into an extended service agreement, but I am not going to say what it is just yet. First, I want to hear from our readers and other Tesla owners on what they would do. If it was your money, would you say yes to Tesla or keep the money in your wallet? After a few of you weigh in, I will tell you what I decided (in consultation with my significant other) with an update in the comments section.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A First-Hand Account Of VinFast’s Automotive Evolution</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: left;\">I’ve been fortunate enough to visit the VinFast manufacturing complex in Hai Phong twice — once in 2022, just after the pandemic and during its early EV transition, and again just last week, as part of a Philippine media delegation.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: left;\">My dad was writing about VinFast as early as 2017 when the car company first announced the release of the<span class=\"oXzekf\" data-huuid=\"3139148461559274108\"> LUX A2.0 and LUX SA2.0. These were internal combustion engine (ICE) models, based on BMW platforms, and used the N20 turbocharged engine. It was the company’s first attempt in car manufacturing. </span></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"oXzekf\" data-huuid=\"3139148461559274108\">Four years ago, my dad <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/06/08/6-reasons-why-vinfast-can-be-an-electric-car-superpower\">wrote this about VinFast</a>: “</span>Their strongest asset is not technology. VinFast is committed to being a global electric automaker. And the strongest asset it has in its possession to achieve this goal is the supercharged thinking and indomitable spirit of the people of VinFast, in particular, and those of VinGroup, in general.”</p>\n<p>Now, that wasn’t a paid influencer blabbing what the script said. That came from an exposure to many years of car assembly and exposure to engineering, methods. techniques, and mostly, people. To me, that was a forecast, which to this day, despite of all the challenges the company faced, he still firmly believes in.</p>\n<p>He adds, “I not only realize the people, the culture, but now the seemingly vast amounts of resources the VinGroup has.”</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Three Tours So Far</strong></h3>\n<p>That 2022 trip was the second for <em>CleanTechnica</em>. This is the third.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/29/a-look-behind-the-curtain-at-vingroups-vinfast/\">Kyle Field did the first one three years ago.</a> I joined my dad, as we were still both writing for another newspaper. It was in 2022 when VinFast was ready to ship the first VF8s and VF9s to America. I recall him asking embarrassing questions to the executives of VinFast about the company’s readiness to export to the world’s toughest auto market.</p>\n<p><em>That question was directed to then-VinFast CEO Madam Le Thi Thu Thuy about the company’s readiness to enter the US market, seemingly unprepared, and I asked, “why not instead focus on the Southeast Asian market first?” VinFast might have a better chance with their closer neighbors. “Probably an easier market to sell to.” Madam Thuy firmly replied saying, “we are up to the challenge of the US market,” and replying about the Asian market question, “we are coming to Asia and the Middle East, and the market will be ready. But we need to start the business in the US first.”</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The difference between these three visits tells a story that goes far beyond production numbers or press releases. This is a story about the gap between ambition and execution, and what it takes to close it.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Impossible, Possible</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Back then, the numbers still seemed impossible.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Ground broken in September 2017. Full production by June 2019. Just 21 months to transform 828 acres of land into a complete automotive manufacturing facility — press shop, paint shop, assembly lines, and engine shop fully operational. Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc didn’t exaggerate when he called it a “miracle.”</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When VinFast broke ground on that 335-hectare site, backed by Vingroup, Vietnam’s largest private conglomerate, they weren’t just building a factory. They were constructing a symbol of national aspiration, a physical manifestation of Vietnam’s determination to leap from manufacturing hub to innovation leader. With full government backing, including free land and generous tax incentives, VinFast delivered on a promise: the first high-volume Vietnamese-branded automobile.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">From day one, the facility deployed cutting-edge automation, with thousands of robots from Siemens and ABB handling stamping, welding, painting, and assembly. It was, and remains, the only Vietnamese plant capable of complete, core vehicle production in Vietnam.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">2022: Impressive Execution On A Steep Learning Curve</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em><strong>RGBT</strong>: My first visit to Hai Phong in 2022 left me genuinely impressed, but with reservations I couldn’t quite shake. The facility was undeniably spectacular: gleaming robots moving in choreographed precision, the scale of the operation, the obvious investment in world-class equipment.</em></p>\n<p><em>As context, my many years as a motoring journalist exposed me to car factories worldwide. Volkswagen in Germany in the early 2000s, the Honda, Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, and Suzuki plants, Ford in Michigan and Corvette in Bowling Green, Chery, BYD, and SAIC in China. </em></p>\n<p><em>Then working for Nissan, I’ve both observed activities at the now shuttered Murayama Assembly Plant, the Yokohama Engine Plant, the soon-to-be closed Oppama Plant (slated to close by the end of fiscal year 2027), the Tochigi Vehicle Assembly Factory and the Shonan Light Commercial Vehicle Plant. I’ve also immersed in the two Nissan Kyushu factories.</em></p>\n<p><em>So what I saw at VinFast in 2022, looked and sounded right.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>But something felt different from the Japanese plants I’d toured over the years. It wasn’t anything I could easily photograph or quantify. It was in the details, the invisible things that separate a factory with great equipment from a factory with great practice.</em></p>\n<p>Walking into Hai Phong in 2025, just three years later, the difference was immediate and profound. This wasn’t just incremental improvement — it was a fundamental maturation. The plant that had impressed me with its ambition in 2022 now commanded respect with its execution.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Electrification Mystery To Mastery</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>In 2022, the battery operations were functional but derivative. </em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>VinFast was essentially assembling battery packs from imported cells and modules — sophisticated Lego blocks from international suppliers being put together in Vietnam. The technical capability was there, but the facility felt more like a very advanced assembly line than a true innovation center. </em></p>\n<p><em>The engineers were knowledgeable, the processes looked efficient, but there was a dependence on outside expertise that was palpable, answers to many questions often referenced partnerships with foreign suppliers rather than in-house development.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Fast forward to 2025. Since I was with my dad on the 2022 trip, I noticed the major shifts in production and what I can only describe as mastery. When I asked detailed questions about battery chemistry or thermal management innovations, they clearly assumed mastery, a <em>shokunin</em> (craftsman) level of knowledge.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">I can only say that the battery complex we toured in 2025 was unrecognizable from 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What had been primarily an assembly operation had evolved into a genuine innovation hub. VinFast engineers now design proprietary battery management systems in-house. The thermal management components are locally developed. Most strikingly, the company has begun developing its own battery chemistries in partnership with global technology leaders — but with Vietnamese engineers leading the work, not just observing it.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The integration is seamless: research labs sit adjacent to production lines, allowing the rapid prototyping and testing that marks true innovation. When I asked technical questions this time, the answers came with the confidence of people who had solved the problems themselves, not imported the solutions.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The quality control systems have been revolutionized. AI-driven inspection systems now detect microscopic defects that were invisible to the human eye. But more importantly, the culture has shifted from inspection-based quality to prevention-based quality — the systems are designed to make defects impossible, not just catchable.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Production capacity has expanded dramatically to support the plant’s ambitious target of 950,000 vehicles annually by 2026, but it’s the <em>quality</em> of that capacity that impressed me most.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Heavy Pressing</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>The stamping plant was perhaps where the gap between ambition and execution was most visible. The presses were modern, the robots impressive, and the speed was remarkable. But when you looked closely at the panels — really studied the surface quality, the consistency from part to part — you could see the difference between a plant that had been operating for three years versus one that had been perfecting its craft for three decades.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>Panel gaps weren’t terrible, but they weren’t tight. Surface quality was acceptable, but you’d occasionally see minor imperfections that would never pass muster at a Lexus or Genesis plant. The quality control seemed to rely heavily on catching defects rather than preventing them — inspectors working hard, but the systems not yet mature enough to eliminate variation at the source.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>More tellingly, there was a certain… tentativeness in how the plant operated. Not incompetence — far from it — but that particular kind of careful deliberation that comes before experience breeds instinct. The plant had the moves down, but it hadn’t yet made them muscle memory.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If the battery plant evolution was impressive, the stamping transformation was nothing short of remarkable. Every press has been recalibrated to tolerances measured in microns — the kind of precision I’ve only seen in German or Japanese facilities with decades of refinement.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The technician who guided us through the stamping plant didn’t just show us the process, he demonstrated the obsession with precision that now permeates every operation. Fresh body panels are inspected with an intensity that borders on paranoid. Advanced vision systems compare each stamped panel in real-time against perfect CAD models, with AI algorithms identifying variations invisible to human inspectors.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But the real change isn’t the technology — it’s the philosophy. In 2022, quality control was something that happened at inspection stations. In 2025, quality is built into every stage of the process. Die management systems ensure perfect temperature and lubrication for every press strike. Statistical process control methodologies borrowed from aerospace manufacturing mean variation isn’t just minimized — it’s engineered out.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The panels coming off the line in 2025 would look at home in any premium vehicle in any market. The fit-and-finish that was merely acceptable in 2022 is now genuinely excellent. The gap has closed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Learned: <em>Kaizen</em></h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>What the plant lacked in 2022 wasn’t technology or investment. At the Japanese plants I visited, you see decades of accumulated learning embedded in countless small optimizations. A tool placed just so. A workflow refined through thousands of iterations. The institutional knowledge that turns good processes into great ones.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>Hai Phong in 2022 had implemented best practices wholesale, but it hadn’t yet earned them through experience. The plant was running before it had fully learned to walk.</em></p>\n<p><em>Here is more context. When working for Chery, I visited the Wuhu plant in 2012 and felt this same “kaizen learning” that I felt at VinFast then. But according to Deriq, this has all changed.</em></p>\n<p class=\"first-token\"><em><span class=\"\">It is kaizen (</span><span class=\"\">改善) or “change for the better” or even better, </span>“continuous improvement.” This is a culture I was enveloped in for many years. </em></p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Kaizen, I found out, doesn’t happen overnight. It is a long-term approach to systematically improving every process within an organization — from manufacturing and supply chain to office procedures and management — by focusing on small,</span><span class=\"\"> incremental changes rather than large,</span><span class=\"\"> radical transformations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Walking the production floor in 2025, I finally saw what had been missing in 2022: <em>practice</em>. Practice makes <em>kaizen</em>. Not just procedures being followed, but mastery being demonstrated. The hesitation was gone, replaced by the fluid confidence that comes from having done something thousands of times and learned from every repetition.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The Japanese and Korean plants I’d used as mental benchmarks? Hai Phong is now operating at that level. The movements are economical, the workflows optimized, the quality consciousness embedded rather than enforced. The plant has earned its professionalism through three years of relentless improvement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Culture Of Immediate Action</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What drove this transformation became clear when VinFast executives shared Chairman Pham Nhat Vuong’s philosophy: “If something’s wrong, fix it immediately.”</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This isn’t just a slogan — it’s how the entire operation functions. When our delegation test-drove the VF3, VF6, and VF9 on the company’s proving grounds, the engineers actively encouraged us to push the vehicles hard and provide brutally honest feedback. Compared to the 2022 event, this time it is not the carefully managed experiences typical of automotive press events, but genuine openness to criticism.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">One executive told us how, when US customers reported software issues, Chairman Vuong ordered an immediate investigation. Within six months, the problems were fully resolved — an extraordinary turnaround that would be impossible at traditional automakers with their layers of bureaucracy and quarterly planning cycles.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This urgency, once channeled purely into speed of construction, has been redirected into speed of improvement. The same intensity that built the plant in 21 months now drives its daily refinement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Ecosystem Advantage</h3>\n\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What distinguishes Hai Phong isn’t just the facility itself — it’s how it integrates into Vingroup’s broader ecosystem. Our delegation visited VinUniversity, where partnerships with Cornell, the University of Pennsylvania, and Nanyang Technological University ensure world-class education is feeding talent directly into the plant.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The proximity of VinMec Smart City Hospital, with its AI-driven diagnostics and robotic systems, creates unexpected synergies. Medical-grade precision manufacturing techniques migrate to automotive applications. The obsessive attention to cleanliness and contamination control in healthcare environments has elevated factory floor standards.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This interconnection of education, healthcare, and manufacturing creates a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation that few automakers can replicate. It compounds over time, and in 2025, the compounding is clearly visible.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\" style=\"text-align: center;\">From Real Estate To Manufacturing, Education, &amp; Medicine</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>The VinFast Hai Phong plant’s journey from 2022 to 2025 mirrors the broader maturation of Vietnam’s industrial ambitions. The country that shocked the world by building an automotive plant in 21 months has now demonstrated something potentially more impressive: the ability to close the execution gap with established industry leaders in just three years.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>Hai Phong was a testament to what money, determination, and modern equipment could accomplish quickly. Impressive, but unproven. It was in April 2022 that VinFast announced it would drop ICE production and focus entirely on developing and manufacturing electric vehicles. That was a clear strategy. They knew what they were up to. </em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><em>In 2025, it’s a demonstration of what happens when that initial investment is combined with obsessive continuous improvement, cultural commitment to quality, and the wisdom to learn from every mistake. The plant hasn’t just caught up to Japanese, German and Korean standards — in some areas, particularly the integration of AI-driven quality control and the speed of innovation cycles, it’s pushing new boundaries.</em></p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The facility’s target of 950,000 vehicles annually by 2026 no longer seems like wishful thinking. Standing on the production floor, watching panels stamped to micron-level precision, batteries assembled with pharmaceutical-grade quality control, and vehicles tested by engineers who genuinely want to hear criticism, the number feels achievable.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The miracle isn’t just that VinFast built Hai Phong in 21 months. The miracle is what they’ve built in the three years since — not just additional capacity, but genuine mastery. From the robotic assembly lines to the battery innovation labs, from the precision stamping presses to the test tracks where engineers welcome our harshest feedback, Hai Phong has evolved from a symbol of ambition into proof of capability.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Vietnam isn’t just aspiring to compete in global automotive manufacturing anymore. With the professionalism and practice now evident at Hai Phong, it has arrived.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">And perhaps most impressive: they’re still accelerating.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story was mostly written by <strong>Deriq Bernard E.

With ranges of up to 625 kilometres for the hatchback and 633 kilometres for the Fastback, ultra-low drag coefficients (0.261 Cd hatchback, 0.23 Cd Fastback), and advanced battery options (58.3 and 81.4 kWh) capable of high-speed charging from 10 to 80% in around 30 minutes, the EV4 combines efficiency, versatility, and real-world usability for European drivers.</p>\n<p>European engineers at the Hyundai Motor Europe Technical Centre (HMETC) fine-tuned the chassis for confident handling, precise cornering, and comfortable long-distance travel. The EV4 also benefits from Kia’s expanding charging network of over one million public points across Europe. Inside, the EV4 embodies Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design philosophy, offering a driver-focused cabin with intuitive technology including the Kia App, Digital Key 2, and over-the-air software updates for a seamless, connected experience. As preannounced at the 2025 EV Day, the EV4 GT is scheduled to be released in 2026.</p>\n<p>“I am proud that the Car of the Year jury continues to recognise Kia,” said Marc Hedrich, President and CEO of Kia Europe. “The EV4 follows in the footsteps of the EV6 and EV3, proving that Kia is not just participating, but competing seriously at the highest level in Europe. Designed, tuned, and produced in Europe for Europe, the EV4 demonstrates that high-quality, responsible electric mobility can be both inspiring and accessible.”</p>\n<p>The 2026 Car of the Year winner will be announced at the Brussels Motor Show, with the award ceremony scheduled for 9 January 2026.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Trump’s attack on UN shipping deal is a harbinger of what’s to come. Here’s how…",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><em>By William Todts</em></p>\n<p>The UN’s International Maritime Organization is not normally a place that grabs the headlines. But the scenes that unfolded in London earlier this month were unprecedented. The US government, led by the President and his secretary of state, invested enormous political capital to threaten, cajole and intimidate other countries to destroy a climate deal countries had agreed in principle only 6 months earlier.</p>\n<p>“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” wrote Trump on social media. The threat was clear: vote for this deal and face punishment from the world’s superpower. US bullying was successful and IMO member states agreed to a year-long postponement. If you read Trump’s statement on the IMO, it becomes clear, getting an ambitious deal in 12 months’ time will be very, very hard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-IMO-shipping.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362858\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-IMO-shipping.jpg\" width=\"361\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trump is not the first US president to torpedo international deals. Bush did the same. Even Obama sabotaged European climate leadership, forcing it to abandon parts of its aviation carbon market, and then cooking up the unimplementable, useless CORSIA offsetting scheme at the UN aviation body (ICAO) in 2016.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But make no mistake, what happened at the IMO was different. Trump’s administration doesn’t want weaker climate ambition, it wants to destroy clean energy and climate action. And it will use the USA’s formidable power to achieve this goal. The sooner we fully accept the implications of this, the better.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, too many Europeans still think making concessions to Trump is a good strategy (not just on climate, sadly). As the ‘negotiations’ reached a crescendo, proposals to abandon and postpone came from all angles. Some EU states suggested sacrificing the EU’s own shipping climate rules to appease him. Trump and his Gulf State allies killed the deal anyway, but they will remember what Europe was willing to sacrifice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, what happened in London was entirely predictable. Did Europe really think they could pass a global climate deal, (wrongly) dubbed the first global carbon tax, without a huge fight? The real battle was waging outside the IMO walls where the US Secretary of State was making phone calls. Europe and its allies weren’t fighting back at that level. If Europe is not willing to seriously face off with Trump, it can forget about global deals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Third, let’s face it, the IMO deal was not great. It would have created a huge new market for crop-based biofuels like palm oil and soybean oil at a time when the world’s rainforests are at <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/crop30-why-burning-food-for-land-hungry-biofuels-is-fueling-the-climate-crisis\">breaking point</a>. It would have expanded LNG in shipping and would have done very little to boost genuinely clean shipping technologies. This is a feature, not a bug, of attempts to regulate globally (CORSIA being the prime example). So we can keep trying to find a compromise that will suit Trump and Saudi Arabia, or we can try something different.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A new approach to global climate deals</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many people say the Paris Agreement is the crowning achievement of climate multilateralism. I agree. However, Paris was only possible AFTER the humiliation of the Copenhagen COP, where Europe abandoned its ambition to have a ‘globally binding’ rule. Indeed, since the Paris Agreement, countries themselves decide their own level of emissions reductions through so-called nationally determined contributions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EU Commission has made carbon pricing a key pillar of its <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2389\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global climate and energy vision</a> (this is mainly about CBAM). Why not extend that logic to shipping and aviation? Nations like the UK can build their own systems to match this and price emissions from these polluting sectors. This could be expanded to Türkiye, Africa (Djibutti and Gabon have already put a similar system in place since 2023), Latin America, Canada and Asia. The US doesn’t have to take part.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The IMO may have failed once more, but that does not mean international climate action is doomed. Europe can and must lead the way. But only if it accepts the implications of what happened in London. That means, no more concessions to Trump and the petrostates, a much more robust diplomatic posture and an acceptance that international climate action will require a new approach.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Countries like Chile and Namibia who voted in favour of the IMO deal have a lot to gain from an e-fuels future powered by renewable energy and are significantly investing in home-grown e-fuels. There is nothing to stop progressive states from working together to deploy the renewable fuels through, for example, green shipping corridors. These are the countries that will benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical games of yesterday.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Article from <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/trumps-attack-on-un-shipping-deal-is-a-harbinger-of-whats-to-come-heres-how-countries-can-still-get-climate-action-done\">T&amp;E</a>.</em></p>\n</div>",

Are Uber and NVIDIA (and Stellantis and others) a match made in heaven? Or are they behind the competition and can’t catch up?</p>\n<p>For that matter, are there going to be any winners? Or could there be many winners, but no monopolistic winners? Perhaps there will be various companies operating robotaxis and self-driving delivery vehicles at low margins.

(I called the contact number and confirmed the program is still active.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For residents interested in scrapping and replacing their </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">old vehicles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Program eligible and program qualified participants can receive up to $10,000 to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Income-qualified participants who reside in designated Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) are eligible for up to $12,000 for these vehicles.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Participants residing in an air district with a CC4A program will not be eligible to scrap and replace with DCAP but can still go through the financing assistance pathway. If they want to scrap and replace, they will have to go through the air districts program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents who don’t have a vehicle to scrap can still </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get assistance</span></a>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “DCAP can provide program eligible and program qualified community members with up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, or fuel cell electric vehicle. Community members are not required to scrap a gas vehicle to take advantage of Financing Assistance pathway.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, there are some charging-related incentives too. “Participants who are approved for DCAP incentives can choose one of </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two charging incentives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: $2,000 towards the purchase and installation of level 2 home charging equipment. We’ve partnered with GRID Alternatives to offer professional home charger installations. A $2,000 prepaid charge card to pay for public charging.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking online, there was a </span><a href=\"https://www.chevroletoffremont.com/used-Fremont-2025-Chevrolet-Equinox+EV-LT-3GN7DLRP2SS149243\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used Chevy Equinox EV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for about $26,000 before incentives. With incentives it could be about $14,000 – $19,000. That price is before any potential savings from using electricity rather than gas or diesel, and potential savings from lower maintenance and repairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brand new Equinox EV is </span><a href=\"https://www.capitolchevysj.com/inventory/new-2026-chevrolet-equinox-ev-lt-front-wheel-drive-suv-3gn7dmrp0ts104650/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about $37,000,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and with incentives it could be about $25,000 to $30,000. This price is also before any potential savings from fuel, and maintenance and repairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also a potential discount from having a Costco membership for some members who can get a deal from participating Chevy dealers in California, although I don’t live there and don’t know who is eligible exactly.</span></p>\n<p>There might be a tendency for some people to assume that US EV sales will suddenly collapse because the federal incentives are gone, but California and Colorado still offer some, so their local EV sales might not suddenly fall apart. If the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/14/top-us-states-for-ev-market-share-13-states-with-10-ev-share/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two largest EV markets</a> in the US do not collapse, then it does not appear accurate to say the national US EV sales will collapse.</p>\n</div>",

It has the following facilities in place there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A unique space in downtown Vancouver.</li>\n<li>4 service &amp; delivery centers in Toronto, Ontario; Richmond, British Columbia; Montreal, Quebec; and Calgary, Alberta.</li>\n<li>Software engineering hubs in downtown Vancouver and Toronto, which is also where engineers from the company’s joint venture with Volkswagen, Rivian Volkswagen Group Technologies, work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canada continues to advance its electrification and decarbonization efforts. In the wake of extreme, unnecessary conflict with the United States due to the decisions of President Donald Trump, rumor is that it’s possible another big step forward could be coming to The Great White North. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/canada-may-remove-100-percent-tariff-on-chinese-made-cars/\">Canada may drop its 100% tariffs on China-produced electric vehicles</a>. If that was to happen, the country could get access to all manner of high-tech, unbelievably affordable, ridiculously compelling electric vehicles from brands like BYD, XPENG, Leapmotor, Zeekr, Avatr, and NIO, among others. For now, though, this is only a rumor and it could just be a negotiating tactic to push back on some of Trump’s demands and behavior.</p>\n<p>In any case, Canada will have more electric vehicles on the roads this Christmas season thanks to the Amazon and Rivian EDV deployment, and I imagine it won’t be long before that fleet of 50 doubles, triples, and quadruples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362815\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-400x267.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-768x512.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-1536x1024.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362817\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1498\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-400x300.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-800x599.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-768x575.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-1536x1150.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n</div>",
