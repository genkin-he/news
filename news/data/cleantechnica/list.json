Selected by 60 jurors from 23 countries, the EV4 is one of just seven finalists from a long list of 35 models. This milestone marks Kia’s eighth COTY shortlist — an unparalleled achievement for a Korean brand — and highlights Kia’s growing influence in the European automotive industry since the Kia Ceed first made the shortlist in 2008.</p>\n<p>Even more remarkable, this is Kia’s fifth consecutive year as a COTY finalist: following the EV6’s win in 2022, the Niro in 2023, the EV9 in 2024, and the EV3’s record-breaking second place in 2025, earning the highest number of points that a Kia model has ever received. This consistent performance establishes Kia as a serious, long-term contender in Europe’s most prestigious automotive competition.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Built for Europe, in Europe</strong></h3>\n<p>The EV4 is Kia’s first all-electric model produced in Europe, manufactured at the company’s Slovakian plant in Žilina on the Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP). With ranges of up to 625 kilometres for the hatchback and 633 kilometres for the Fastback, ultra-low drag coefficients (0.261 Cd hatchback, 0.23 Cd Fastback), and advanced battery options (58.3 and 81.4 kWh) capable of high-speed charging from 10 to 80% in around 30 minutes, the EV4 combines efficiency, versatility, and real-world usability for European drivers.</p>\n<p>European engineers at the Hyundai Motor Europe Technical Centre (HMETC) fine-tuned the chassis for confident handling, precise cornering, and comfortable long-distance travel. The EV4 also benefits from Kia’s expanding charging network of over one million public points across Europe. Inside, the EV4 embodies Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design philosophy, offering a driver-focused cabin with intuitive technology including the Kia App, Digital Key 2, and over-the-air software updates for a seamless, connected experience. As preannounced at the 2025 EV Day, the EV4 GT is scheduled to be released in 2026.</p>\n<p>“I am proud that the Car of the Year jury continues to recognise Kia,” said Marc Hedrich, President and CEO of Kia Europe. “The EV4 follows in the footsteps of the EV6 and EV3, proving that Kia is not just participating, but competing seriously at the highest level in Europe. Designed, tuned, and produced in Europe for Europe, the EV4 demonstrates that high-quality, responsible electric mobility can be both inspiring and accessible.”</p>\n<p>The 2026 Car of the Year winner will be announced at the Brussels Motor Show, with the award ceremony scheduled for 9 January 2026.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Trump’s attack on UN shipping deal is a harbinger of what’s to come. Here’s how…",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><em>By William Todts</em></p>\n<p>The UN’s International Maritime Organization is not normally a place that grabs the headlines. But the scenes that unfolded in London earlier this month were unprecedented. The US government, led by the President and his secretary of state, invested enormous political capital to threaten, cajole and intimidate other countries to destroy a climate deal countries had agreed in principle only 6 months earlier.</p>\n<p>“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” wrote Trump on social media. The threat was clear: vote for this deal and face punishment from the world’s superpower. US bullying was successful and IMO member states agreed to a year-long postponement. If you read Trump’s statement on the IMO, it becomes clear, getting an ambitious deal in 12 months’ time will be very, very hard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-IMO-shipping.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362858\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-IMO-shipping.jpg\" width=\"361\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trump is not the first US president to torpedo international deals. Bush did the same. Even Obama sabotaged European climate leadership, forcing it to abandon parts of its aviation carbon market, and then cooking up the unimplementable, useless CORSIA offsetting scheme at the UN aviation body (ICAO) in 2016.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But make no mistake, what happened at the IMO was different. Trump’s administration doesn’t want weaker climate ambition, it wants to destroy clean energy and climate action. And it will use the USA’s formidable power to achieve this goal. The sooner we fully accept the implications of this, the better.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, too many Europeans still think making concessions to Trump is a good strategy (not just on climate, sadly). As the ‘negotiations’ reached a crescendo, proposals to abandon and postpone came from all angles. Some EU states suggested sacrificing the EU’s own shipping climate rules to appease him. Trump and his Gulf State allies killed the deal anyway, but they will remember what Europe was willing to sacrifice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, what happened in London was entirely predictable. Did Europe really think they could pass a global climate deal, (wrongly) dubbed the first global carbon tax, without a huge fight? The real battle was waging outside the IMO walls where the US Secretary of State was making phone calls. Europe and its allies weren’t fighting back at that level. If Europe is not willing to seriously face off with Trump, it can forget about global deals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Third, let’s face it, the IMO deal was not great. It would have created a huge new market for crop-based biofuels like palm oil and soybean oil at a time when the world’s rainforests are at <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/crop30-why-burning-food-for-land-hungry-biofuels-is-fueling-the-climate-crisis\">breaking point</a>. It would have expanded LNG in shipping and would have done very little to boost genuinely clean shipping technologies. This is a feature, not a bug, of attempts to regulate globally (CORSIA being the prime example). So we can keep trying to find a compromise that will suit Trump and Saudi Arabia, or we can try something different.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A new approach to global climate deals</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many people say the Paris Agreement is the crowning achievement of climate multilateralism. I agree. However, Paris was only possible AFTER the humiliation of the Copenhagen COP, where Europe abandoned its ambition to have a ‘globally binding’ rule. Indeed, since the Paris Agreement, countries themselves decide their own level of emissions reductions through so-called nationally determined contributions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EU Commission has made carbon pricing a key pillar of its <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2389\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">global climate and energy vision</a> (this is mainly about CBAM). Why not extend that logic to shipping and aviation? Nations like the UK can build their own systems to match this and price emissions from these polluting sectors. This could be expanded to Türkiye, Africa (Djibutti and Gabon have already put a similar system in place since 2023), Latin America, Canada and Asia. The US doesn’t have to take part.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The IMO may have failed once more, but that does not mean international climate action is doomed. Europe can and must lead the way. But only if it accepts the implications of what happened in London. That means, no more concessions to Trump and the petrostates, a much more robust diplomatic posture and an acceptance that international climate action will require a new approach.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Countries like Chile and Namibia who voted in favour of the IMO deal have a lot to gain from an e-fuels future powered by renewable energy and are significantly investing in home-grown e-fuels. There is nothing to stop progressive states from working together to deploy the renewable fuels through, for example, green shipping corridors. These are the countries that will benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical games of yesterday.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Article from <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/trumps-attack-on-un-shipping-deal-is-a-harbinger-of-whats-to-come-heres-how-countries-can-still-get-climate-action-done\">T&amp;E</a>.</em></p>\n</div>",

Are Uber and NVIDIA (and Stellantis and others) a match made in heaven? Or are they behind the competition and can’t catch up?</p>\n<p>For that matter, are there going to be any winners? Or could there be many winners, but no monopolistic winners? Perhaps there will be various companies operating robotaxis and self-driving delivery vehicles at low margins.

(I called the contact number and confirmed the program is still active.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For residents interested in scrapping and replacing their </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">old vehicles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Program eligible and program qualified participants can receive up to $10,000 to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Income-qualified participants who reside in designated Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) are eligible for up to $12,000 for these vehicles.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Participants residing in an air district with a CC4A program will not be eligible to scrap and replace with DCAP but can still go through the financing assistance pathway.

For now, though, this is only a rumor and it could just be a negotiating tactic to push back on some of Trump’s demands and behavior.</p>\n<p>In any case, Canada will have more electric vehicles on the roads this Christmas season thanks to the Amazon and Rivian EDV deployment, and I imagine it won’t be long before that fleet of 50 doubles, triples, and quadruples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362815\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-400x267.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-768x512.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-1536x1024.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362817\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1498\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-400x300.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-800x599.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-768x575.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-1536x1150.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Their demand would allow them to generate emissions credits, undermining the ambition level of the regulation. This could delay production and reduce sales of zero emission trucks (ZETs) by 27% in 2030, according to T&amp;E analysis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This weakening would be a significant setback for logistics companies that are waiting for e-truck prices to come down. Rolling back on already agreed targets to produce electric trucks would create investment uncertainty for Europe’s charging infrastructure industry and risk European truckmakers losing out to Chinese competitors.</p>\n<p>Stef Cornelis, freight and fleet director said “Truckmakers want to give the impression that this is just about a small adjustment, but the opposite is true. It would mean a major rollback of Europe’s plans to decarbonise trucks and cut sales of e-trucks by almost a third in 2030. They are creating huge investment uncertainty for the charging infrastructure and power sector who need to start building grids and charging infrastructure today. The trucking industry claims that lack of charging infrastructure is the main bottleneck but how do they expect a power company to invest if they are now rolling back on their own commitments? The European Commission should hold the line. The more Europe and our truckmakers delay the transition, the more we risk losing the market to Chinese competitors.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362809\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png 1400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-400x286.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-800x571.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-768x549.png 768w\" width=\"1400\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note: This is a T&amp;E modelling of the potential impact of scrapping the linear emission reduction trajectory on zero-emission truck uptake.

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The US government has not been a friend to the vehicle electrification movement this year, to put it kindly. Nevertheless, the pace of zero emission innovation will march on with or without an assist from President Donald Trump. The latest example comes from BMW, which has jumped into the solid state EV battery race with an assist from the US battery materials startup Solid Power and the Korean firm Samsung SDI.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nothing Can Stop The Solid State EV Battery Of The Future</h3>\n<p>A solid state EV battery is just what the name says, a battery that replaces the conventional liquid electrolyte with solid materials. Replacing a liquid with a solid poses all sorts of challenges (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09675-8\">here’s</a> one example), but the payoff for the vehicle electrification movement is substantial (see more <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=solid+state+ev+battery\">solid state battery background here</a>).</p>\n<p>Aside from eliminating fire hazards, a solid state EV battery offers automakers a lighter, more compact, longer lasting, and higher-performing mobile energy storage solution. In short, it helps make <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/new-online-cost-calculator-aims-to-rebuild-ev-sales-in-the-us/\">the case for owning an EV</a> even stronger than ever before.</p>\n<p>With those prizes in mind, battery researchers have been chipping away at the solid state obstacles for a good ten years or so, and all that hard work is about to pay off. Trump or no Trump, the commercialization of a solid state EV battery is a foregone conclusion, and the past month alone has seen a renewed rush of activity.</p>\n<p>The US firm QuantumScape kicked things off by pairing up with Corning to fine tune a new high-efficiency manufacturing system for its <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/30/the-solid-state-ev-battery-race-heats-up-as-corning-quantumscape-join-forces/\">ceramic battery separator</a>. Toyota followed in short order with a reminder that it expects to <a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/43380876.html\">launch EVs into the market</a> with solid state batteries within the next two years or so, and then along comes BMW with some news of its own.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BMW Has A Solid State EV Battery Up Its Sleeve</h3>\n<p>BMW has been eyeballing Solid Power’s solid state solution as far back as 2016. The automaker jumped on the opportunity to invest in Solid Power when it went public in 2021, and BMW further dropped some hints regarding <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/22/100-solid-state-ev-batteries-seal-the-deal-no-more-gasmobiles/\">a collaboration with Solid Power</a> earlier this year. They were not kidding around. Under the newest stage of collaboration with BMW, Solid Power will contribute its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">sulfide-based solid electrolyte</a> to Samsung SDI for use in fabricating solid state battery cells.</p>\n<p>The three firms have not released performance parameters and other details of the new agreement, but the cooperative effort is designed to culminate in the launch of a BMW demonstration vehicle.</p>\n<p>The road from the laboratory to a demonstration vehicle is a long one. Solid Power has been floating across the <em>CleanTechnica</em> radar on and off since launching in 2011, as a spin-off from research at the University of Colorado-Boulder. The company replaces both the liquid electrolyte and polymer separator with a single layer of a sulfide-based solid material.</p>\n<p>“This thin, solid layer acts as a barrier to keep the anode and cathode from touching one another, which would short the battery. It also acts as a conductive electrolyte,” Solid Power explains.</p>\n<p>With an eye on containing costs and fostering rapid scale-up, Solid Power <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">designed its solid state electrolyte</a> around earth-abundant materials and ease of manufacturing. The company isn’t saying exactly what kind of sulfides go into its formula. That’s a trade secret! However, but sulfides (compounds of sulfur with other substances) do occur commonly in nature, one particularly abundant example being the sulfur-iron mineral pyrite, also known as fool’s gold.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sulfides Vs. Ceramics</h3>\n<p>Those of you familiar with the state of solid state EV battery technology are probably familiar with the challenges posed by sulfide-based electrolytes. QuantumScape, for example, is among the solid state stakeholders that have settled on <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/07/12/new-quantumscape-solid-state-ev-battery-exposes-ev-sales-flop-fakery-again/\">high tech ceramics</a> as alternative to sulfide-based electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries.</p>\n<p>Toyota, in contrast, cites several advantages on the sulfide side, including the potential for scale-up. “<a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39865919.html\">Sulfide solid electrolytes</a> are characterized by softness and adhesiveness to other materials, which is suitable for battery mass production,” Toyota also notes. The company has been working with the firm Idemitsu on a lithium sulfide foundation for solid state batteries.</p>\n<p>Stellantis is another <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/23/stellantis-to-demo-muscular-solid-state-ev-battery-in-muscle-car/\">sulfide-curious automaker</a>. Last year the company hooked up with the US solid state battery startup Factorial Energy, which has developed a sulfide-based electrolyte it calls “Solstice.” Factorial also has an ongoing relationship with Mercedes-Benz.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Next Steps For The EV Battery Supply Chain</h3>\n<p>The solid state battery of the future aside, the US still needs to secure its EV battery supply chain here and now. That was a difficult task even before Trump took office earlier this year, one key issue being the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other critical materials.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/21/how-the-us-can-solve-its-lithium-supply-problem-in-one-fell-swoop/\">workarounds</a> have been emerging, including systems that extract lithium from oil and gas drilling wastewater. The ARPA-E branch of the US Department of Energy has just stepped it up a level with the launch of a new $25 million round of funding for new wastewater-based extraction technologies.</p>\n<p>That may seem a bit off-topic for the Trump administration. However, <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-events/news-and-insights/energy-department-announces-25-million-extract-critical-minerals-wastewater\">critical materials</a> have broad applications among key US industries. If the auto industry also benefits, so much the better. After all, what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p>\n<p>The $25 million pot comes under an ARPA-E program called RECOVER, which is the somewhat forced shorthand for “Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters.”</p>\n<p>ARPA-E already anticipates another round of RECOVER funding to follow this week’s announcement. For now, the beneficiaries include The University of Texas – Austin, which will recover lithium and other materials from both oilfield and municipal wastewater.</p>\n<p>RECOVER also tasks Johns Hopkins University with recovering two other key EV battery materials, cobalt and nickel, from industrial wastewater from a variety of sources including e-waste recycling facilities, lithium-ion battery factories, produced water from oilfields, and discharges from mining operations.</p>\n<p>Considering the Trump administration’s fraught (to put it mildly) relationship with Ivy League schools, one project of particular interest is a $1.655 million award to Columbia University to recover lithium and magnesium from wastewater.</p>\n<p>Magnesium (not to be confused with manganese) is a relatively new development in the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/22/magnesium-batteries-are-beginning-to-give-up-their-secrets/\">energy storage</a> field, so stay tuned for more news on that score.</p>\n<p><em>Photo: The US startup Solid Power is contributing its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/overview/default.aspx\">sulfide-based electrolyte</a> to a new solid state EV battery in partnership with BMW and the Korean firm Samsung SDI (cropped, courtesy of Solid Power).</em></p>\n</div>",
