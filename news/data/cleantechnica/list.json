            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The Tesla Semi was my favorite Tesla vehicle when it was introduced. It could cut emissions so much, and it looks cool. Unfortunately, we’re now approaching the 8-year anniversary of that vehicle’s unveiling! The Tesla Semi was introduced on November 16, 2017. Without a doubt, it has taken much longer for this vehicle to get to mass production than most of us thought and hoped. The guy whose idea it was and who led the program, Jerome Guillen, has long left Tesla — reportedly, because of the Semi not being prioritized and mass production being delayed indefinitely.</p>\n<p>However, now, it seems Tesla is nearly ready to scale up production and actually get these on the road as initially presented.</p>\n<p>“Cybercab, Tesla Semi and Megapack 3 are on schedule for volume production starting in 2026,” Tesla wrote in its <a href=\"https://assets-ir.tesla.com/tesla-contents/IR/TSLA-Q3-2025-Update.pdf\">3rd quarter report</a> for shareholders. In the vehicle production capacity table, Tesla indicated that the factory was under construction, and Elon Musk reiterated that on the call.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the report, Tesla stated: “V4 superchargers enable 500kW charging for passenger vehicles and 1,200kW charging for Tesla Semi, enabling the fastest charging time for trucks in the U.S.”</p>\n<p>A fan located near the factory has also snapped some pictures of the factory’s progress and shared them this week.</p>\n\n\n<p>It appears that the exterior of the factory is nearly done.</p>\n<p>So, at long last, the Tesla Semi may <em>really</em> be coming to market! Yoohoo.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "California Still Has Some EV Purchasing Incentives",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a week ago, I wrote an article about Colorado increasing its </span><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/24/colorado-increasing-its-ev-purchasing-incentives/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EV purchasing incentives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The federal EV incentives are gone, so it matters a lot if some US states still offer them. I wondered if California still has its incentives, and the answer is yes, fortunately — at least according to a CA state website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California has the most electric vehicles in the US and it’s a huge state with about 39 million people. It also easily has the largest number of public EV charging ports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In cities such as LA, San Diego, San Jose, Stockton, Sacramento, San Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, Richmond, and Santa Clara there is too much air pollution that is bad for human health and the environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State of California Clean Driving Assistance Program has incentives to help California residents get cleaner vehicles. (I called the contact number and confirmed the program is still active.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For residents interested in scrapping and replacing their </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">old vehicles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Program eligible and program qualified participants can receive up to $10,000 to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). Income-qualified participants who reside in designated Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) are eligible for up to $12,000 for these vehicles.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Participants residing in an air district with a CC4A program will not be eligible to scrap and replace with DCAP but can still go through the financing assistance pathway. If they want to scrap and replace, they will have to go through the air districts program.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residents who don’t have a vehicle to scrap can still </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get assistance</span></a>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “DCAP can provide program eligible and program qualified community members with up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used battery electric vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, or fuel cell electric vehicle. Community members are not required to scrap a gas vehicle to take advantage of Financing Assistance pathway.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, there are some charging-related incentives too. “Participants who are approved for DCAP incentives can choose one of </span><a href=\"https://drivingcleanca.org/about-us/dcap-eligibility/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two charging incentives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: $2,000 towards the purchase and installation of level 2 home charging equipment. We’ve partnered with GRID Alternatives to offer professional home charger installations. A $2,000 prepaid charge card to pay for public charging.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking online, there was a </span><a href=\"https://www.chevroletoffremont.com/used-Fremont-2025-Chevrolet-Equinox+EV-LT-3GN7DLRP2SS149243\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used Chevy Equinox EV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for about $26,000 before incentives. With incentives it could be about $14,000 – $19,000. That price is before any potential savings from using electricity rather than gas or diesel, and potential savings from lower maintenance and repairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brand new Equinox EV is </span><a href=\"https://www.capitolchevysj.com/inventory/new-2026-chevrolet-equinox-ev-lt-front-wheel-drive-suv-3gn7dmrp0ts104650/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about $37,000,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and with incentives it could be about $25,000 to $30,000. This price is also before any potential savings from fuel, and maintenance and repairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also a potential discount from having a Costco membership for some members who can get a deal from participating Chevy dealers in California, although I don’t live there and don’t know who is eligible exactly.</span></p>\n<p>There might be a tendency for some people to assume that US EV sales will suddenly collapse because the federal incentives are gone, but California and Colorado still offer some, so their local EV sales might not suddenly fall apart. If the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/14/top-us-states-for-ev-market-share-13-states-with-10-ev-share/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two largest EV markets</a> in the US do not collapse, then it does not appear accurate to say the national US EV sales will collapse.</p>\n</div>",

It has the following facilities in place there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A unique space in downtown Vancouver.</li>\n<li>4 service &amp; delivery centers in Toronto, Ontario; Richmond, British Columbia; Montreal, Quebec; and Calgary, Alberta.</li>\n<li>Software engineering hubs in downtown Vancouver and Toronto, which is also where engineers from the company’s joint venture with Volkswagen, Rivian Volkswagen Group Technologies, work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canada continues to advance its electrification and decarbonization efforts. In the wake of extreme, unnecessary conflict with the United States due to the decisions of President Donald Trump, rumor is that it’s possible another big step forward could be coming to The Great White North. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/canada-may-remove-100-percent-tariff-on-chinese-made-cars/\">Canada may drop its 100% tariffs on China-produced electric vehicles</a>. If that was to happen, the country could get access to all manner of high-tech, unbelievably affordable, ridiculously compelling electric vehicles from brands like BYD, XPENG, Leapmotor, Zeekr, Avatr, and NIO, among others. For now, though, this is only a rumor and it could just be a negotiating tactic to push back on some of Trump’s demands and behavior.</p>\n<p>In any case, Canada will have more electric vehicles on the roads this Christmas season thanks to the Amazon and Rivian EDV deployment, and I imagine it won’t be long before that fleet of 50 doubles, triples, and quadruples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362815\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-400x267.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-800x533.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-768x512.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-7-1536x1024.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a> <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362817\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1498\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1.png 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-400x300.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-800x599.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-768x575.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Rivian-delivery-van-in-Canada-1-1536x1150.png 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n</div>",

Rolling back on already agreed targets to produce electric trucks would create investment uncertainty for Europe’s charging infrastructure industry and risk European truckmakers losing out to Chinese competitors.</p>\n<p>Stef Cornelis, freight and fleet director said “Truckmakers want to give the impression that this is just about a small adjustment, but the opposite is true. It would mean a major rollback of Europe’s plans to decarbonise trucks and cut sales of e-trucks by almost a third in 2030. They are creating huge investment uncertainty for the charging infrastructure and power sector who need to start building grids and charging infrastructure today. The trucking industry claims that lack of charging infrastructure is the main bottleneck but how do they expect a power company to invest if they are now rolling back on their own commitments? The European Commission should hold the line. The more Europe and our truckmakers delay the transition, the more we risk losing the market to Chinese competitors.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362809\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU.png 1400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-400x286.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-800x571.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electric-truck-sales-in-EU-768x549.png 768w\" width=\"1400\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note: This is a T&amp;E modelling of the potential impact of scrapping the linear emission reduction trajectory on zero-emission truck uptake.

            "title": "BMW Is One Step Closer To The Solid State EV Battery Of The Future",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The US government has not been a friend to the vehicle electrification movement this year, to put it kindly. Nevertheless, the pace of zero emission innovation will march on with or without an assist from President Donald Trump. The latest example comes from BMW, which has jumped into the solid state EV battery race with an assist from the US battery materials startup Solid Power and the Korean firm Samsung SDI.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nothing Can Stop The Solid State EV Battery Of The Future</h3>\n<p>A solid state EV battery is just what the name says, a battery that replaces the conventional liquid electrolyte with solid materials. Replacing a liquid with a solid poses all sorts of challenges (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09675-8\">here’s</a> one example), but the payoff for the vehicle electrification movement is substantial (see more <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=solid+state+ev+battery\">solid state battery background here</a>).</p>\n<p>Aside from eliminating fire hazards, a solid state EV battery offers automakers a lighter, more compact, longer lasting, and higher-performing mobile energy storage solution. In short, it helps make <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/new-online-cost-calculator-aims-to-rebuild-ev-sales-in-the-us/\">the case for owning an EV</a> even stronger than ever before.</p>\n<p>With those prizes in mind, battery researchers have been chipping away at the solid state obstacles for a good ten years or so, and all that hard work is about to pay off. Trump or no Trump, the commercialization of a solid state EV battery is a foregone conclusion, and the past month alone has seen a renewed rush of activity.</p>\n<p>The US firm QuantumScape kicked things off by pairing up with Corning to fine tune a new high-efficiency manufacturing system for its <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/30/the-solid-state-ev-battery-race-heats-up-as-corning-quantumscape-join-forces/\">ceramic battery separator</a>. Toyota followed in short order with a reminder that it expects to <a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/43380876.html\">launch EVs into the market</a> with solid state batteries within the next two years or so, and then along comes BMW with some news of its own.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BMW Has A Solid State EV Battery Up Its Sleeve</h3>\n<p>BMW has been eyeballing Solid Power’s solid state solution as far back as 2016. The automaker jumped on the opportunity to invest in Solid Power when it went public in 2021, and BMW further dropped some hints regarding <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/22/100-solid-state-ev-batteries-seal-the-deal-no-more-gasmobiles/\">a collaboration with Solid Power</a> earlier this year. They were not kidding around. Under the newest stage of collaboration with BMW, Solid Power will contribute its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">sulfide-based solid electrolyte</a> to Samsung SDI for use in fabricating solid state battery cells.</p>\n<p>The three firms have not released performance parameters and other details of the new agreement, but the cooperative effort is designed to culminate in the launch of a BMW demonstration vehicle.</p>\n<p>The road from the laboratory to a demonstration vehicle is a long one. Solid Power has been floating across the <em>CleanTechnica</em> radar on and off since launching in 2011, as a spin-off from research at the University of Colorado-Boulder. The company replaces both the liquid electrolyte and polymer separator with a single layer of a sulfide-based solid material.</p>\n<p>“This thin, solid layer acts as a barrier to keep the anode and cathode from touching one another, which would short the battery. It also acts as a conductive electrolyte,” Solid Power explains.</p>\n<p>With an eye on containing costs and fostering rapid scale-up, Solid Power <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations/investor-news/news-details/2025/Solid-Power-Partners-with-Samsung-SDI-and-BMW-to-Advance-All-Solid-State-Battery-Technology/default.aspx\">designed its solid state electrolyte</a> around earth-abundant materials and ease of manufacturing. The company isn’t saying exactly what kind of sulfides go into its formula. That’s a trade secret! However, but sulfides (compounds of sulfur with other substances) do occur commonly in nature, one particularly abundant example being the sulfur-iron mineral pyrite, also known as fool’s gold.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Sulfides Vs. Ceramics</h3>\n<p>Those of you familiar with the state of solid state EV battery technology are probably familiar with the challenges posed by sulfide-based electrolytes. QuantumScape, for example, is among the solid state stakeholders that have settled on <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/07/12/new-quantumscape-solid-state-ev-battery-exposes-ev-sales-flop-fakery-again/\">high tech ceramics</a> as alternative to sulfide-based electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries.</p>\n<p>Toyota, in contrast, cites several advantages on the sulfide side, including the potential for scale-up. “<a href=\"https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39865919.html\">Sulfide solid electrolytes</a> are characterized by softness and adhesiveness to other materials, which is suitable for battery mass production,” Toyota also notes. The company has been working with the firm Idemitsu on a lithium sulfide foundation for solid state batteries.</p>\n<p>Stellantis is another <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/23/stellantis-to-demo-muscular-solid-state-ev-battery-in-muscle-car/\">sulfide-curious automaker</a>. Last year the company hooked up with the US solid state battery startup Factorial Energy, which has developed a sulfide-based electrolyte it calls “Solstice.” Factorial also has an ongoing relationship with Mercedes-Benz.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Next Steps For The EV Battery Supply Chain</h3>\n<p>The solid state battery of the future aside, the US still needs to secure its EV battery supply chain here and now. That was a difficult task even before Trump took office earlier this year, one key issue being the environmental impact of mining for lithium and other critical materials.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/21/how-the-us-can-solve-its-lithium-supply-problem-in-one-fell-swoop/\">workarounds</a> have been emerging, including systems that extract lithium from oil and gas drilling wastewater. The ARPA-E branch of the US Department of Energy has just stepped it up a level with the launch of a new $25 million round of funding for new wastewater-based extraction technologies.</p>\n<p>That may seem a bit off-topic for the Trump administration. However, <a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-events/news-and-insights/energy-department-announces-25-million-extract-critical-minerals-wastewater\">critical materials</a> have broad applications among key US industries. If the auto industry also benefits, so much the better. After all, what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p>\n<p>The $25 million pot comes under an ARPA-E program called RECOVER, which is the somewhat forced shorthand for “Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters.”</p>\n<p>ARPA-E already anticipates another round of RECOVER funding to follow this week’s announcement. For now, the beneficiaries include The University of Texas – Austin, which will recover lithium and other materials from both oilfield and municipal wastewater.</p>\n<p>RECOVER also tasks Johns Hopkins University with recovering two other key EV battery materials, cobalt and nickel, from industrial wastewater from a variety of sources including e-waste recycling facilities, lithium-ion battery factories, produced water from oilfields, and discharges from mining operations.</p>\n<p>Considering the Trump administration’s fraught (to put it mildly) relationship with Ivy League schools, one project of particular interest is a $1.655 million award to Columbia University to recover lithium and magnesium from wastewater.</p>\n<p>Magnesium (not to be confused with manganese) is a relatively new development in the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/22/magnesium-batteries-are-beginning-to-give-up-their-secrets/\">energy storage</a> field, so stay tuned for more news on that score.</p>\n<p><em>Photo: The US startup Solid Power is contributing its <a href=\"https://www.solidpowerbattery.com/overview/default.aspx\">sulfide-based electrolyte</a> to a new solid state EV battery in partnership with BMW and the Korean firm Samsung SDI (cropped, courtesy of Solid Power).</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Carlos Tavares Thinks Tesla Might Be Dead In 10 Years",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Carlos Tavares was the CEO of Stellantis for nearly 4 years, from January 2021 to December 2024. Stellantis is the parent company of 14 brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS Automobiles, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram Trucks, and Vauxhall. So, yes, the guy knows a lot about the automobile business. Whether he’s a genius or an idiot depends on who you ask, but he is one of the few people in the world who has ever run a large automobile company.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/tesla/ane-tavares-musk-tesla-byd-overvalued-company-1027/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Automotive News\">Automotive News</a></em>, Tavares certainly didn’t shy away from making a controversial statement that was always going to garner countless headlines and intense discussion. They key line was: “I’m not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years.”</p>\n<p>Even as a simple possibility, that’s a big statement to make. Tesla has more than $40 billion in the bank and is profitable quarter after quarter. However, as I highlighted recently, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/22/teslas-financial-trends-look-horrible-who-is-to-blame/\">the company has been seeing several negative financial trends</a>. Additionally, as we discuss in a fresh new YouTube video, it does seem like Tesla might be rolling itself into another “bet the company” phase of life. Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, back to Carlos Tavares. He highlighted the growth and evolution of the China EV market, and the possibility that Elon Musk will focus more and more on non-Tesla matters. “We can’t rule out that at some point, he’ll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX, or artificial intelligence,” he said. “Tesla’s stock market loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric. I’m not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. … It’s an innovative group, but they will be beaten by BYD’s efficiency.”</p>\n<p>That has certainly been a common perspective critics of Elon Musk and Tesla have had, but to hear it from a major automobile company CEO — or former CEO — made my jaw drop a bit. If Tavares was a YouTube influencer or journalist, one might say he’s just putting out clickbait, but I don’t think he’s trying to get attention by making this comment. Rather, it is most likely something he believes. Critics will say, “Well, that’s why he was fired from Stellantis. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Maybe. Or maybe he’s on to something.</p>\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/23/7-positives-from-tesla-in-3rd-quarter/\">with $41 billion in the bank</a>, Tesla is in an absolutely fine position at the moment. In the 3rd quarter, the company had revenue of $28.1 billion and net income of $1.8 billion. Not too shabby. It would take several quarters of things going very wrong for Tesla to get into financial trouble. But spending a lot of money while sales go in the wrong direction quarter after quarter can catch up on you quickly. We’ll see what happens. The coming few quarters should tell us a lot more.</p>\n<p><em>Featured <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_Tavares_2_Genf_2018.jpg\">image</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexander-93\" title=\"User:Alexander-93\">Alexander Migl</a> (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0 license</a>)</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Hyundai’s BEV Sales Grow 47% Globally",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Hyundai is involved in all sectors of the auto industry. It’s still selling millions of gas-powered cars a year, it’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/hyundai-pushes-hydrogen-cars-in-japan-%f0%9f%98%82/\">pushing hydrogen-fueled cars</a>, and it has long been seen as one of the better developers of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We really can’t celebrate the first two, but it is good to see that Hyundai continues on path #3 in a good way.</p>\n<p>In a quarterly report published today, Hyundai Motor Company highlighted that its global sales grew 4.8% in the 3rd quarter, but that was really all about growth of its “electrified” vehicles. Their sales rose 37%. But it gets even better — BEV sales rose 47%!</p>\n<p>BEVs reached 87,737 sales. Their percentage growth was only beaten by fuel cell electric vehicles (161%), but those are still at a very small volume of course (3,828 sales in the quarter).</p>\n<p>BEVs were well above plugin hybrids (PHEVs), which rose 26% to 11,301 sales. Hyundai’s largest “electrified” powertrain was conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), which rose 32% to 158,629 sales.</p>\n<p>It’s unfortunate to see BEVs still well below the sales of fossil-fueled vehicles (conventional hybrids included), but it’s great to see their strong growth and the fact that their sales volume has reached more than 50% the volume of Hyundai’s hybrid vehicle sales.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/hyundai-motor-company-reports-strong-q3-2025-performance-4.8%2525-global-growth-driven-by-37%2525-electrified-vehicle-surge-0000001043\">the company</a> is proud that “electrified vehicles now represent 25% of total global retail sales — meaning more than one in four Hyundai vehicles sold globally is electrified, up from 19% just one year ago.” BEVs, which I’m sure is what most of us care about, accounted for 8.47% of Hyundai’s sales in the 3rd quarter.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, Hyundai’s BEV sales were boosted a bit by the EV sales rush in the United States from the US tax credit for EVs expiring. Here’s what the company has to say about its North American success:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America’s performance shows that manufacturing localization delivers results. The region achieved 314,964 retail units in Q3, up 13.2%, but the electrified vehicle story is even more compelling: 94,786  electrified units (30.1% of regional sales), up 52.6% year-over-year.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia continues to ramp up IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 9 production. These are American-made electric vehicles that contributed to 34,244 EV sales, up 52.0%. Palisade Hybrids, Santa Fe Hybrids, and Tucson Hybrids drove 58,774 hybrid sales, up 51.5%.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“North America now has the highest electrified growth rate of any major Hyundai region, with nearly one-third of all vehicles sold carrying an electrified powertrain. This validates the company’s U.S. investment strategy: build locally, customize to local preferences, and grow with the market.”</p>\n<p>So, it’s not just just BEVs that grew strongly for the brand. Though, not stated by Hyundai is that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/01/hyundai-ioniq-5-sales-soar-90-in-3rd-quarter/\">its BEV sales were up 103.1% in the US</a>, driven especially by the IONIQ 5 (up 90% to <em>21,999 sales</em>) and the IONIQ 9 (which was not on sale yet in the 3rd quarter of 2024 and reached 3,164 sales in the 3rd quarter of 2025) — but even the IONIQ 6 was up 29% to 2,810 sales.</p>\n<p>Naturally, outside of North America, Europe is a big market for Hyundai’s EV sales. “Europe continues its journey toward electrification leadership with 149,757 retail units in Q3, up 3.2%, but more significantly, 71,040 units (47.4% of regional sales) are now electrified, up 28.0 year-over-year,” the company writes. “Europe’s 47.4% electrified penetration rate is a preview of Hyundai’s future globally, where the company targets 60% electrified sales (BEV, HEV, PHEV, EREV, FCEV) by 2030.” In my opinion, that’s still a rather weak target and I do still think Hyundai isn’t aggressive enough with full electrification. But maybe this is the best it can do.</p>\n<p>Regarding actual electric vehicles, Hyundai adds: “The INSTER, named 2025 World Electric Vehicle of the Year, is proving that affordable, practical EVs can succeed in Europe’s competitive market. The IONIQ family continues winning customers from legacy European brands. And the 30,641 EV sales, up 60.1%, demonstrate that when you offer award-winning products at competitive prices, customers respond regardless of market conditions.” That 30,641 total is more than 20% of Hyundai’s European sales, but <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/06/europe-ev-sales-report-second-best-month-ever-for-bevs/\">that’s basically the norm in Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, 47% growth is quite considerable growth. So, kudos to Hyundai. The 4th quarter will likely be tougher, but hopefully the company can surprise us.</p>\n</div>",
