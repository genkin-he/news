            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Aberdeen’s decision to retire and try to sell its 25 hydrogen double decker buses closes a chapter that began with confident claims about global leadership in clean transport. The fleet was promoted as the world’s first hydrogen double deck operation and positioned as a foundation for a broader hydrogen economy that would anchor hundreds of local jobs. After several years of mixed performance, infrastructure strain, and parallel deployment of battery electric buses, the council chose to pivot away from hydrogen. The decision was probably cathartic for many in Aberdeen. It was arithmetic catching up with ambition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368990\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1942\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline.png 1536w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline-316x400.png 316w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline-633x800.png 633w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline-768x971.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-vs-hydrogen-bus-timeline-1215x1536.png 1215w\" width=\"1536\"/></a></p>\n<p>The council has indicated that it intends to sell the 25 hydrogen double deckers to recover some capital, but the likelihood of achieving a meaningful resale value is low. There is no deep or liquid secondary market for used hydrogen buses. Previous hydrogen bus pilots in places such as British Columbia ended with vehicles being listed for sale, yet those cases did not lead to the emergence of an ongoing aftermarket. Hydrogen buses are tightly coupled to specific refuelling infrastructure, maintenance expertise, and supply contracts, which sharply limits the pool of potential buyers. Any operator considering a used hydrogen bus must already have compatible hydrogen supply and trained technicians, or be willing to build that capability for a small fleet of aging vehicles. In practice, most hydrogen deployments have been grant-supported pilots rather than commercially scaled systems, so the number of prospective purchasers is small. Aberdeen may find a buyer, but the expectation of a substantial capital recovery is optimistic given the absence of a functioning global resale market.</p>\n<p>If the focus is strictly on hydrogen double deck buses, the used market is thin. The primary platform in operation has been the Wrightbus StreetDeck Hydroliner, deployed in limited numbers in London, Aberdeen, and Northern Ireland. London introduced an initial batch—likely due to political pressure from hydrogen-focused Lord Bamford, founder of JCB, to keep his son’s company WrightBus out of insolvency—but has not pursued follow-on orders, instead concentrating new procurement on battery electric double deckers. Belfast and Metrobus added some additional hydrogen units, but these remain small fleets rather than rapidly scaling programs. There is no evidence of a broad procurement wave of hydrogen double deck buses across the UK comparable to the steady and much larger rollout of battery electric double deckers in major cities. The technology persists solely in niche deployments, with no growth momentum that would suggest willing buyers.</p>\n<p>The original vision was coherent within the misguided optimism of the mid 2010s. Hydrogen was widely framed as a universal energy carrier. Scotland was seeking post-oil positioning, and like many fossil fuel economies saw hydrogen as an energy carrying savior. Aberdeen had already invested in hydrogen infrastructure, including the Kittybrewster refuelling station delivered in 2015 at roughly £1 million in capital from BOC. By 2020, 15 hydrogen double deckers were delivered under an £8.3 million program supported by the Scottish Government and EU funding. Ten more followed under an additional £4.5 million award. Individual buses were around £500,000 each. The plan was that this fleet would anchor a hydrogen hub, scale into heavy vehicles, and help justify new local hydrogen production.</p>\n<p>The economics of the refuelling station were always the critical factor. Kittybrewster was designed for about 360 kg of hydrogen per day, or roughly 131,400 kg per year at full utilization. Reported throughput suggests about 160 tons dispensed over four years, which works out to around 40,000 kg per year. That is about 30% of nameplate capacity. The 2024 council documentation recorded operating costs of approximately £974,000 over three years, or roughly £325,000 per year. Against a £1 million capital cost, that is about 30% of capex annually in O&amp;M alone. That aligns with what I have previously calculated for <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/27/californias-hydrogen-stations-being-fixed-more-hours-than-pumping-at-15-capex-per-year/\">California hydrogen refuelling stations</a>, where O&amp;M frequently lands in the 20% to 35% of capex per year range once compressors, service contracts, and staffing are included. It does not align with the 4% O&amp;M assumptions still embedded in many transportation cost models and is another data point about the high cost of running hydrogen refueling stations.</p>\n<p>The contrast with battery electric charging infrastructure is structural. A hydrogen refuelling station such as Kittybrewster is effectively a small industrial plant, with electrolysers that have finite stack life, high pressure compressors, drying systems, storage vessels, safety systems, and specialized dispensers. Electrolyser stacks typically require major refurbishment within a decade, compressors are maintenance intensive, and O&amp;M can run in the 20% to 35% of capex per year range, as Aberdeen’s own numbers indicate. By comparison, a battery electric depot charging installation is primarily electrical infrastructure: grid connection upgrades, transformers, switchgear, rectifiers, and charging cabinets. There is no fuel production, no high pressure storage, and no chemical processing. Maintenance is typically a small fraction of capex, there are no stacks to replace and no compressors to overhaul, and expansion is modular and incremental as fleets grow. When a charging unit reaches end of life it is replaced as a component. When a hydrogen station reaches end of life it often requires coordinated and capital intensive reinvestment across multiple subsystems. That difference in complexity and lifecycle burden goes a long way toward explaining why one struggled to justify further capital and the other scales predictably with demand.</p>\n<p>Annualizing the £1 million capital investment over 10 years at a 7% corporate discount rate yields about £142,000 per year. Adding the recorded £325,000 per year in O&amp;M brings fixed annual cost to roughly £467,000. At 40,000 kg per year, fixed cost alone is about £11.70 per kg. Even if throughput were closer to 60,000 kg per year, fixed cost would still be around £7.70 per kg. Full system electricity consumption for onsite electrolysis including balance of plant and compression is about 65 kWh per kg. Using a realistic large business electricity rate in Scotland of roughly £0.205 per kWh, electricity alone costs about £13 per kg. Adding fixed cost produces hydrogen in the range of roughly £20 to £25 per kg at Kittybrewster.</p>\n<p>The hydrogen refuelling station did not fail because of some single dramatic breakdown but because it reached the practical end of its initial operational life and required substantial reinvestment to continue operating. Kittybrewster was showing its age by the early 2020s: compressors, dispensers and the electrolysis stacks themselves were approaching the point at which major overhauls or replacements are typical in hydrogen station life-cycle plans, and the station had delivered only a fraction of its theoretical throughput because the fleet itself never created the sustained demand foreseen in early project models.</p>\n<p>Council papers in 2024 laid out that a life-extension programme was needed to keep the station in service, but BOC, as the owner and operator, declined to invest in that capex without long-term contractual guarantees on operations and revenue from the council or its partners. From BOC’s perspective this was a business decision: without a firm committed offtake or long-term operating contract to underwrite the cost of stack replacement, compressor servicing and controls upgrades that would likely run into the low hundreds of thousands of pounds, the risk and cost were theirs to carry for uncertain future benefit. As the operating contract expired, BOC began decommissioning activities, and the station stopped regular production, leaving the hydrogen buses effectively stranded without reliable fuel. This sequence of reaching end-of-life technical requirements, absence of a clear revenue stream to justify overhaul costs, and the station ceasing to produce fuel set the stage for the council’s pivot away from hydrogen altogether.</p>\n<p>The council considered taking ownership of the asset. Council papers in 2024 indicate that officials were exploring a transfer so that public funds could be used to refurbish and extend the station’s life, rather than investing in a privately owned facility. The logic was that if hydrogen remained part of Aberdeen’s transport strategy, the city would need direct control over its refuelling infrastructure. In practice, this would have meant the council assuming not just the capital cost of upgrades but the ongoing technical and financial risk of operating a small, under-utilized hydrogen plant.</p>\n<p>By the time the council formally decided to dispose of the fleet, the hydrogen buses had already been effectively sidelined for a prolonged period. Reporting indicates that regular service ceased in mid to late 2024 as refuelling reliability deteriorated and production at the Kittybrewster station faltered. That means the buses sat idle for well over a year before the final policy pivot in early 2026. For a capital asset designed around a 15-year service life and roughly 1,000,000 km of operation, losing 12 to 18 months of active deployment is not a minor disruption. It represents a meaningful erosion of expected lifetime utilization and further worsens the already strained cost per km economics.</p>\n<p>The wider hydrogen strategy in Aberdeen was tied to a larger plan for expanded refuelling capacity under a joint venture with BP, structured through a company called bp Aberdeen Hydrogen Energy Limited. That project had moved well beyond conceptual stages: the council approved seed funding, planning permission was granted for a new hydrogen production and refuelling facility at Hareness Road linked to a solar farm on the former Ness landfill, and a phased build was envisaged that would produce over 800 kg of hydrogen per day in its first phase with capacity to grow to multiple tonnes as demand expanded.</p>\n<p>The narrative supporting that plan rested on the assumption that the city’s own hydrogen double-deck fleet and other future hydrogen vehicles would create predictable demand, justifying both the capital investment and the long-term operating commitments. Kittybrewster was phase one, BP’s facility was supposed to replace it as phase 2 and there were expectations of a phase 3 with shipping and aviation fuels. With the collapse of hydrogen as a viable bus solution and no other large, committed offtake on the horizon, the council is now actively seeking to unwind or exit its obligations in the joint venture rather than proceed with building out the hub. What was once sold as an economic opportunity and regional anchor project has become a liability of uncertain value precisely because the foundational demand assumptions have evaporated.</p>\n<p>Aberdeen City Council faces real financial and contractual exposure as it seeks to unwind its joint venture with BP over the planned hydrogen production hub, which had been budgeted at around £20 million for the first phase of build-out. Officials are understood to be in negotiations on how to transfer or terminate the partnership rather than simply walk away, which could involve bearing costs tied to planning, site preparation, permitting and early project development that BP and the council had already committed to under the joint venture agreement.</p>\n<p>Because BP made a final investment decision in mid-2024 and the venture had progressed toward construction before being paused, the council may also need to address sunk costs it agreed to under JV funding arrangements as well as any liabilities for commitments made to third parties or contractors. In discussions reported between the council and BP, part of the exit planning appears to involve negotiating the transfer of the joint venture entity back to the council so that assets and obligations can be managed in a way that aligns with the pivot to battery electric infrastructure, but this transfer itself is likely to carry accounting and cash implications for Aberdeen’s balance sheet and future capital programmes.</p>\n<p>This set of ongoing fiscal liabilities after the end of attempts to grow hydrogen fleets is typical as well. My <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/18/the-hydrogen-workshop-transit-agencies-actually-need/\">guidance piece</a> for transit agencies expecting to receive hydrogen buses around a risk mitigation workshop makes it clear that cities and agencies need to carefully plan for failure to avoid being left on the hook.</p>\n<p>It is also worth remembering that the hydrogen double deck fleet was not Aberdeen’s first attempt at hydrogen buses. Between 2015 and about 2020 the city operated ten Van Hool A330H single deck hydrogen buses as part of the original Aberdeen Hydrogen Bus Project. Those vehicles were fuelled at the Kittybrewster station and ran in regular service for roughly five years under a publicly funded demonstration program. When that phase ended, the buses were withdrawn rather than forming the foundation of a growing commercial fleet. At least one entered museum preservation, and there is no evidence of a meaningful secondary market or redeployment elsewhere. In other words, Aberdeen had already completed a full hydrogen bus trial with Van Hool single deckers before committing to 25 new double deckers. Those buses cost about €850,00, vastly higher than any buses, but were apparently fully funded by the EU Jive program before being abandoned. One went into a museum and the rest apparently were scrapped. The second phase was not a first experiment. It was a renewed bet on a technology that had already been tested locally and had not scaled organically.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, Van Hool was one of the early European manufacturers to make a significant strategic bet on hydrogen fuel cell buses, positioning models such as the A330H as part of a zero-emission future well before battery electric buses had matured. That bet coincided with other strategic strains, including aggressive expansion, exposure to low-margin contracts, and supply chain disruptions in the early 2020s. By 2024 the company entered bankruptcy proceedings, and its assets were split between new owners, with the bus division effectively carved up rather than continuing as a unified manufacturer. The hydrogen focus was not the sole cause of its collapse, but it was part of a portfolio of high-risk bets in a market that shifted rapidly toward battery electric. At the same time, Dutch transit authorities that had once explored hydrogen for regional buses increasingly pivoted to battery electric fleets, citing cost, infrastructure simplicity, and reliability. The Netherlands, long considered open to hydrogen in mobility, has in practice moved decisively toward electrification for urban and regional bus transit, reinforcing the broader European trend away from hydrogen buses at scale.</p>\n<p>Van Hool is far from alone in OEMs which have committed to hydrogen drive trains entering insolvency. The number of entrants which still offer hydrogen vehicles is overtopped by the ones that have exited the market or gone bankrupt. Quantron, Nikola and Hyzon are higher profile failures, but far from the only ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368992\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"751\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1537px) 100vw, 1537px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison.png 1537w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison-400x195.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison-800x391.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Electric-bus-hydrogen-bus-comparison-768x375.png 768w\" width=\"1537\"/></a></p>\n<p>When translated into cost per kilometre, the picture becomes clearer. Hydrogen double deck buses typically consume about 6 to 7 kg per 100 km, or 0.06 to 0.07 kg per km. At £22 per kg midpoint, that is around £1.32 to £1.54 per km in energy. Using the upper end of the cost range pushes that to around £1.70 per km. Diesel double deckers typically consume about 0.5 litres per km. At roughly £1.42 per litre, fuel cost is around £0.71 per km. Battery electric double deckers such as the Enviro400EV consume about 0.67 kWh per km. At £0.205 per kWh, electricity cost is about £0.14 per km. On energy alone, hydrogen is roughly 2 to 4 times the cost of diesel and about 10 times the cost of battery electric in Aberdeen’s context.</p>\n<p>Looking at full lifetime capital and energy costs reinforces the gap. Assuming a 1,000,000 km service life, capital cost per km for a £500,000 hydrogen bus is £0.50 per km. Diesel buses at roughly £225,000 land at about £0.23 per km. Battery electric buses at around £450,000 are about £0.45 per km. Adding energy cost produces totals of roughly £0.93 per km for diesel, about £0.59 per km for battery electric, and between £1.76 and £2.23 per km for hydrogen.</p>\n<p>However, the Aberdeen hydrogen buses did not achieve anything close to a full design life. If they effectively delivered on the order of 240,000 km before being sidelined, capital cost alone rises to about £2.08 per km, pushing total cost into the £3.34 to £3.81 per km range before maintenance and infrastructure are considered. This kind of foreshortened life is not unusual in hydrogen bus trials globally, where reliability, refuelling constraints, and policy pivots often prevent fleets from reaching their theoretical lifetime. Even under generous full-life assumptions hydrogen struggles to compete. Under real-world outcomes, the economics deteriorate further.</p>\n<p>Infrastructure scale compounded the risk. Hydrogen stations are dominated by fixed cost. Low utilization drives up cost per kg. Kittybrewster was running at roughly 30% of capacity. The proposed BP hydrogen hub was designed to produce more than 800 kg per day in its first phase, more than double Kittybrewster’s capacity. That expansion assumed growth in hydrogen vehicles. Instead, hydrogen heavy vehicles did not scale in meaningful numbers. The bus fleet remained the primary demand anchor. Scaling supply without scaling demand increases financial exposure. The math does not improve because policy hopes it will.</p>\n<p>Operational complexity added further friction. First Aberdeen was managing diesel, battery electric, and hydrogen buses in the same depot environment. Each drivetrain requires different skills, tools, parts, and safety procedures. Hydrogen adds high pressure storage, fuel cell stacks, and additional cooling systems. In the guidance I prepared for a hydrogen risk mitigation workshop for transit agencies, I explicitly recommended retaining diesel buses past their expected end of life as contingency cover for hydrogen reliability issues. Aberdeen effectively followed that pattern, borrowing diesel buses when hydrogen units were withdrawn. Maintaining three drivetrain technologies increases cost and complexity. It does not make failure inevitable, but it reduces resilience.</p>\n\n<p>On operational emissions alone, the contrast between the three drivetrains is stark even on Scotland’s relatively clean grid. Using Scotland’s average electricity carbon intensity of about 20.7 gCO2e/kWh, a battery electric double deck consuming roughly 0.67 kWh/km emits about 14 gCO2e per km, or about 0.8 tCO2e per year at 60,000 km. A diesel double deck consuming about 0.5 litres per km at 2.66 kgCO2e per litre emits roughly 1.33 kgCO2e per km, which is close to 80 tCO2e per year over the same distance. A hydrogen bus supplied by onsite electrolysis using about 65 kWh/kg and consuming 6.1 to 7.0 kg per 100 km lands around 5 to 6 tCO2e per year on a no-leakage basis. However, assuming 5% hydrogen leakage, a reasonable assumption based on leakage data from <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/21/how-much-does-hydrogen-leak-and-how-much-does-it-matter/\">hydrogen infrastructure leakage studies</a>, and applying a GWP20 of about 37, total operational impact rises to roughly 12 to 14 tCO2e per year. Even on a low-carbon grid, hydrogen sits an order of magnitude above battery electric and far below diesel, but leakage meaningfully narrows the gap.</p>\n<p>This outcome is not isolated. <a href=\"https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/transport/brussels-public-transit-agency-opts-for-battery-electric-over-hydrogen-to-decarbonise-buses-after-years-long-fuel-cell-vehicle-test/2-1-1805284\">Brussels abandoned its hydrogen bus trial</a> after confronting high fuel cost and supply challenges. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/02/05/canadas-hydrogen-bus-trials-canceled-due-to-high-costs-emissions/\">Whistler abandoned its fleet</a> as soon as it could, four years in. Several other European hydrogen bus programs have scaled back or pivoted to battery electric. In the UK, hydrogen fleets have struggled with availability and refuelling reliability. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/02/06/beijing-buses-95-electric-hydrogen-buses-dwindling-refueling-stations-closing/\">Beijing’s Winter Olympic hydrogen refueling stations and bus fleet</a> are increasingly fenced off, parked and infiltrated with vegetation.  Globally, hydrogen bus deployments have plateaued while battery electric bus registrations continue to grow. The pattern is visible across jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The predictability rests on energy conversion physics. Hydrogen for buses requires electricity to run electrolysis at roughly 65% efficiency. Compression and storage add additional losses. Fuel cells convert hydrogen back into electricity at roughly 50% to 60% efficiency. The overall round trip from grid to wheels is often below 35%. Battery electric buses move electricity from grid to wheels at above 80% efficiency. Each additional conversion step adds cost. When electricity prices are high, those losses are magnified.</p>\n<p>Aberdeen had access to these numbers before the buses were purchased. They had already trialed hydrogen buses and refueled them. The cost structure of hydrogen refuelling stations was not hidden. O&amp;M burdens well above 20% of capex per year were visible in California and other markets, in addition to their own experience. Multiple hydrogen bus trials had already struggled or been curtailed globally. The choice to proceed was a deliberate policy decision. The only unambiguous positive development in this story is the decision to retire the hydrogen bus fleet and pivot to battery electric. It is appropriate to acknowledge the correction, not the initial error.</p>\n<p>The broader lesson is straightforward. Urban buses are an electron problem. They operate on fixed routes, return to depots nightly, and can charge on predictable schedules. In motion charging is simple and solves key route and elevation concerns. Hydrogen has roles in fertilizer production, refining, and certain industrial heat applications where molecules are required. Using hydrogen for urban buses competes directly with battery electric systems that are simpler and cheaper. When the energy cost difference exceeds £1 per km, subsidies can delay adjustment but cannot close the gap.</p>\n<p>All required pilot projects have already been conducted. Aberdeen ran one. Brussels ran one. California ran many. The results converge. High fixed infrastructure cost, high O&amp;M, low utilization, expensive fuel, and eventual transition to battery electric. Demonstrations are valuable when uncertainty is high. In this case, uncertainty has been replaced by repetition. The energy transition will be shaped by technologies that scale economically, not by technologies that require persistent subsidy to compete.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>For a market that is still largely fossil fuel engine-dominated, the ability to compare multiple electrified platforms in one venue matters.</p>\n<p>The United Asia Automotive Group Inc. (UAAGI) ability to bring champion brands BAIC, Chery, Foton, Jetour, Lynk &amp; Co, and Radar under its wing reflects how quickly Chinese and China-linked brands are expanding the range of electrified options available to Filipino consumers, from family SUVs to commercial vans and lifestyle pickups.</p>\n<p>UAAGI is leaning into that shift with the first leg of its 2026 “On the Move” roadshow at SM Mall of Asia, a four-day event that places hybrids, plug-in hybrids, range-extended EVs, and battery-electric vehicles side by side with their internal-combustion counterparts — and, more importantly, puts them on a test-drive route.</p>\n<p>More than 20 vehicles are available for test drives, and the mix shows how the industry is approaching electrification in the Philippines: not through a single technology, but through a spectrum. There are conventional hybrids aimed at fuel savings, plug-in hybrids designed to extend electric-only daily driving, range-extended electric vehicles that address charging anxiety, and full battery-electric platforms for fleet and shuttle applications.</p>\n<p>“By locating these strong brands together in one we provide the power of choice,” Rommel Sytin, CEO of UAAGI, told <em>CleanTechnica</em>. He said that in the choice of brand partners, technology diversity is not accidental. Charging infrastructure in the Philippines is growing but remains uneven, and many buyers are still making their first move away from pure combustion. Electrified vehicles that can operate without daily reliance on public charging — particularly PHEVs and REEVs — are emerging as a transitional solution.</p>\n<p>“We believe we are contributing largely to the quick adoption of EVs and helping build the ecosystem for it,” Sytin said.</p>\n\n<p>The BAIC B60e Beaumont rEV is a full-size, 7-seat, range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) priced at approximately P3,498,000 ($62,098) in the Philippines. Unlike traditional hybrids, it uses a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine primarily as a generator to charge a 40.3 kWh lithium-ion battery, which in turn powers a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system. This configuration produces a combined output of 540 hp and 655 Nm of torque, enabling a manufacturer-claimed comprehensive driving range of 1,200 km and a pure electric range of approximately 152 km.</p>\n<p>Designed with off-road utility in mind, the B60e features a body-on-frame chassis, nine selectable drive modes, and a 800 mm wading depth with a dedicated water level indicator. The interior is characterized by a “six-screen” layout, including twin 12.8-inch panels for the driver and front passenger, a head-up display, and a digital rear-view mirror. Standard equipment includes a 12+1 Infinity speaker system with active noise cancellation, ventilated and massaging seats, and the “Big Assist+” ADAS suite, which provides Level 2 automation features like lane centering and autonomous emergency braking.</p>\n\n<p>Chery is showcasing the Tiggo rEV Luxury Edition, a 7-seat plug-in hybrid SUV priced starting at P1,528,000 ($26,463) and reaching P1,598,000 ($27,676) for the high-trim variant. It utilizes a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine combined with a Dedicated Hybrid Transmission (DHT) and an 18.66 kWh lithium-ion battery. The system produces a combined output of 204 hp and 310 Nm of torque, supporting a manufacturer-rated combined driving range of up to 1,400 km. It is compatible with both Type 2 (AC) and CCS2 (DC) charging standards, which is a distinguishing feature in its price segment, where many competitors only offer AC charging. The vehicle posted a fuel economy figure of 84.28 km/Lge (liters gas equivalent) in the Department of Energy (DoE) fuel-economy run in 2025.</p>\n<p>The vehicle is equipped with a 15.6-inch infotainment touchscreen, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 12-speaker Sony audio system. Standard safety features include a 540-degree camera system and an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) suite featuring adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and lane departure warning.</p>\n\n<p>For the commercial sector — a crucial piece of the local transport ecosystem — Foton’s Traveller Sierra EV points to where electrification could scale faster. The 12-seat battery-electric van, with a 77.28 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery and a rated range of over 300 kilometers (WLTP), fits the duty cycle of shuttle services, hotels, and corporate fleets, where vehicles return to a depot and can charge overnight. Fleet adoption has long been viewed as a practical entry point for EVs in the country because utilization rates are high and operating costs are easier to quantify.</p>\n<p>“Our commercial vehicle offerings are far advanced than any other brand in the market,” Sytin stressed.</p>\n<p>Then there is the Radar RD6 EM-P electrified pickup — a segment that has traditionally been among the hardest to decarbonize in Southeast Asia. Pickup trucks are central to both private use and small-business logistics in the Philippines. Introducing electrified options in this category signals that the transition is moving beyond city cars and crossovers into work vehicles and lifestyle platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Jetour and Lynk &amp; Co are both emphasizing long-range plug-in hybrid systems that can function as daily EVs for short urban trips while retaining the ability to travel intercity without charging stops. Lynk &amp; Co’s 08 EM-P, in particular, has already demonstrated what that architecture can do in controlled conditions, setting distance records for both hybrid and pure-electric operation.</p>\n<p>On-site financing approvals, insurance packages, and trade-in appraisals reduce the friction that often slows adoption. For many buyers, the barrier is no longer awareness but the complexity of the purchase process and the upfront cost. Packaging everything into one location shortens the decision cycle — something that has proven effective in other emerging EV markets.</p>\n<p>Equally important are the test drives. Primarily a sales tool, they are also educational. Experiencing instant torque, quiet operation, regenerative braking, and one-pedal driving are difficult to communicate through specifications alone. Putting first-time drivers behind the wheel remains one of the most effective ways to shift perception.</p>\n<p>UAAGI says additional legs of the roadshow will be announced later in the year. If the format travels beyond Metro Manila, it could help address one of the persistent gaps in the Philippine EV transition: most exposure to electrified vehicles is still concentrated in major urban centers.</p>\n<p>The broader significance of events like this is that they move the conversation from future plans to present-day choices. Electrification in the Philippines is no longer limited to early adopters and pilot programs. It is showing up in mainstream retail spaces, in family SUVs, in people movers, and in pickup trucks.</p>\n<p>And when buyers can test drive all of those in a single afternoon, the transition stops being abstract.</p>\n\n</div>",

            "title": "Battery Swapping Expands In New York City",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The EV battery swapping movement has been gathering steam around the world, with one key market being the millions of e-bikes on the road. Things are finally beginning to take off here in the US, too. A modest pilot project focusing on battery safety for e-bike delivery riders in New York City has been deemed a success, and it is expanding to all five boroughs.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Fire Safety &amp; Battery Swapping</h3>\n<p>According to the New York City Department of Transportation, <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/install-public-e-bike-battery-swapping-network-citywide.shtml\">the lithium-ion batteries used in e-bikes</a> were responsible for 900 fires in New York City between 2022 and 2025. Properly certified and maintained e-bike batteries are safe by and large, but non-certified batteries accounted for many of the fires. In addition to property damage, 30 people were killed by fires attributed to e-bike batteries, and 400 were injured.</p>\n<p>Public battery swapping stations are one potential solution. They provide drivers with a fully charged, certified and properly maintained battery, reducing if not eliminating the need to charge a battery at home.</p>\n<p>Even without the safety angle, battery swapping could also benefit e-bike riders who value increased uptime and the guarantee of a full charge with every swap. That sounds like common sense, but city planners in New York needed some hard data before moving ahead with a full scale swapping station plan. To assess rider attitudes towards swapping stations, DOT designed a pilot project consisting of five stations in Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p>\n<p>The pilot launched in March of 2024. Reporting on the first five months of the pilot program in August of that year, DOT was already able to make a strong case for scale-up. A selected group of 120 riders who participated in the program made <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/nyc-dot-successful-charging-pilot.shtml\">more than 8,000 swaps</a> among the five stations in the five-month period.</p>\n<p>“The results of an onboarding survey administered by NYC DOT found that 84 percent of pilot participants were previously charging their e-bike batteries at home,” the agency noted.</p>\n<p>The stations were also equipped with charging ports, enabling riders to recharge batteries without a swap. DOT recorded almost 1,000 recharging sessions among the five stations during the first five months of the pilot project.</p>\n<p>In terms of reducing fire risks, the numbers showed that public swapping stations can make a significant difference. More than half of the riders participating in pilot said that they stopped charging at home. In addition, others said that they reduced home charging.</p>\n<p>Riders indicated the public stations enabled them to spend more time at work, too. As an added convenience, they also reported that they no longer needed to carry an extra battery to complete a day’s work.</p>\n<p>“Findings from the pilot show that food delivery workers are enthusiastically participating and can now be more productive, and that access to these charging stations has resulted in a reduction, and some elimination, of home charging,” DOT stated, adding that there were no safety-related issues or other complaints about the stations during the pilot phase.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">More Battery Swapping For NYC</h3>\n<p>By the end of last year, DOT firmed up its plans for expanding out of the pilot stage and into a full-fledged citywide program consisting of <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2025/install-public-e-bike-battery-swapping-network-citywide.shtml\">25 swapping stations</a>, focusing on neighborhoods with the highest traffic.</p>\n<p>“All battery-swapping cabinets will be equipped with fire suppression features, real-time battery health monitoring, and automatic alerts to the system provider to enhance safety,” DOT noted in a press statement on November 18. In the release, the areas under consideration for swapping stations included most of Manhattan along with Downtown Brooklyn, the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, Long Island City in Queens, and parts of the South Bronx.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/sidewalk-e-bike-battery-swapping-charging-cabinets-101.pdf\">Property owners</a> can also apply for a revocable consent agreement with DOT, enabling them to install battery swapping and charging stations for their tenants. That program is administered by DOT in coordination with the Fire Department and the Department of Buildings.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Even More Battery Swapping Stations For NYC</h3>\n<p>DOT states that the public swapping station network will be available to e-bike riders on a membership basis, with the cost to be determined. The agency has not updated the program since the November announcement (unless I missed something), but two of its private sector partners are not shy about tooting their horns. On February 27, the German battery swapping firm Swobbee announced that it is ready to roll along with its connectivity collaborator, the US branch of the global firm SINBON.</p>\n<p>Swobbee collaborated on the initial pilot project, and last year the company began installing swapping stations in Jersey City, New Jersey, as well as New York City. “After the pilot demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sinbon-and-swobbee-to-collaborate-expanding-battery-swapping-infrastructure-across-new-york-city-302698111.html\">a safer, fire-compliant alternative</a> to traditional e-bike charging, Swobbee received approval to scale across all five boroughs, with more than dozens of additional stations planned by the end of the year,” the company stated.</p>\n<p>I’m reaching out to Swobbee for more details on the scale-up plan, as there seems to be a word missing from “more than dozens.” In the meantime, the company does provide an update on the rider use numbers. Including riders in Jersey City, Swobbee has seen about 150,000 battery swaps since March of 2025.</p>\n<p>“The pilot demonstrated that battery swapping can significantly improve safety while making daily work easier for delivery riders. After its success, we received the green light to expand across all five boroughs,” affirmed Sowbbee CEO Thomas Duscha.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What About Cars?</h3>\n<p>The US has some catching up to do as the rest of the world embraces the battery swapping movement. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/20/ev-battery-swapping-takes-over-africa-is-us-next/\">E-bikes and other two-wheelers</a> are the low-hanging fruit because riders can easily change the battery by hand. Passenger cars and trucks present a next-level challenge, but that nut is also beginning to crack in China and other hotspots around the world.</p>\n<p>Don’t look for four-wheeled swapping to go mainstream in the US any time soon. Although <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/04/what-did-elon-musk-know-about-ev-battery-swapping-and-when-did-he-know-it/\">Tesla planted a swapping station</a> in California back in 2013, it was barely a trial (and some claim it was simply to get some government funding) and CEO Elon Musk soon lost interest in the idea. The US firm Ample picked up the ball, but the company reportedly filed for bankruptcy on December 16 last year.</p>\n<p>As for elsewhere, keep an eye on the German firm E-Haul, which has developed <a href=\"https://www.ehaul.de/en-us\">a fully automated swapping system</a> for heavy-duty trucks. E-Haul also notes that its swapping stations can pull double duty as grid storage assets.</p>\n<section data-slice-type=\"two_titles_one_paragraph\" data-slice-variation=\"default\">\n\n</section>\n</div>",

            "title": "Denza Officially Launches in Philippines with D9 DM-i MPV",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The premium new energy vehicle brand Denza, a high-end division of BYD, has officially launched its operations in the Philippines. The debut took place in Manila with the introduction of the Denza D9 DM-i, a plug-in hybrid executive MPV.</p>\n<p>Last September 2025, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/25/touring-byds-hq-and-realizing-the-technology-arsenal-it-has-part-1/\">when <em>CleanTechnnica </em>was in China for the BYD Media Plant Tour</a>, we asked Adam Hu, Country Head of BYD Philippines, about the possibility of Denza in the Philippines. He didn’t hide the plan. “We have intentions to bring Denza to the Philippines, and as early as April last year <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/01/23/denza-begins-philippine-operations-as-premium-electrified-segment-expands/\">we were already building the foundations for this</a>. The Philippines is a very important market to us,” he told <em>CleanTechnica</em>. “Our partners are very strong in the luxury segment and we are eager to bring the brand.” However, he intimated that at that time the supplies were all targeted to their first-mover markets in China, which has a huge appetite for the luxury brand.</p>\n\n<p>During the proceedings, BYD Asia-Pacific Auto Sales Division General Manager Liu Xueliang addressed the brand’s strategic entry. “Across Asia-Pacific, we’ve seen strong momentum for Denza as more markets embrace premium new energy vehicles. That experience gives us confidence in the Philippines, where consumers are increasingly sophisticated and ready to engage with a brand that combines intelligent technology with refined design and comfort,” Xueliang said. He further clarified the brand’s market role, stating, “We’re not here to compete. The best tech must be enjoyed by more people. This is why we’re bringing in so many vehicles to the Philippines. Through Denza, we want to make the luxury market enjoy and feel our NEVs.”</p>\n<p>The Denza D9 DM-i is a seven-seat MPV utilizing a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine paired with dual electric motors and a 40 kWh Blade Battery. This powertrain produces a combined 401 horsepower and 681 Nm of torque. It features an all-wheel-drive configuration and offers a total driving range of 980 kilometers, with an electric-only range of 180 kilometers.</p>\n<p>The interior is characterized by Nappa leather upholstery across all rows. The second row is equipped with zero-gravity seats featuring 10-way power adjustment, heating, ventilation, and massage functions. Technical equipment includes a 15.6-inch central infotainment screen, two 12.8-inch rear entertainment displays, and a 14-speaker Dynaudio sound system.</p>\n<p>“What we’re building with Denza is a long-term vision for premium mobility—one where innovation serves the driver, sustainability is seamlessly integrated, and every vehicle reflects a smarter way forward. Nowadays, it is technology that truly drives elegance. And at Denza, we see new energy vehicles as an opportunity to rethink how power, comfort, and sustainability can work together in a more thoughtful, human way,” Hu said.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"0\">The Philippine debut is part of a rapid global offensive for Denza. Once a domestic Chinese luxury play, the brand has spent the last year establishing a presence across Southeast Asia, with active operations in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In these markets, the D9 MPV serves as the flagship. Though, local executives have signaled that the lineup will soon diversify to meet a growing appetite for high-end electrified transport.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"1\">Beyond ASEAN, Denza is aggressively targeting Oceania and Europe to position itself against established legacy marques. In Australia, the brand recently launched the B5 and B8 plug-in hybrid SUVs—premium off-roaders aimed directly at the Toyota Land Cruiser segment—with plans to expand to over 20 dealerships by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, Denza made its European entry last year, leading with the Z9 GT shooting brake, a model that serves as the brand’s technical showcase for the Western market.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"2\">This global rollout is supported by a unified strategy that often rebrands BYD’s most advanced sub-series under the Denza umbrella for international buyers. From the high-performance Z9 GT in Europe to the rugged “Leopard” based SUVs in Australia, the brand is leveraging BYD’s most sophisticated platforms to establish itself as a dominant force in the global luxury new energy vehicle space.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the launch event featured a performance by the Manila Symphony Orchestra, led by conductor Darrell Ang, to signal the brand’s positioning in the luxury segment.</p>\n<p>Denza is establishing its presence through a four-dealer network in Makati, Alabang, Greenhills, and Cebu. The company also showcased the Denza Z9 GT, B5, and B8 models, which are expected to join the local lineup later this year.</p>\n<p>The Denza D9 DM-i is priced at P4,298,000 ($74,436). An introductory price of P3,998,000 ($69,241) is available for the first 300 customers.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>While the US focuses on extracting and burning coal just like the world did in the 19th century, researchers in China are actively engaged in finding new, less expensive batteries with higher power and longer service life. While America looks back wistfully to its horse and buggy roots, China is preparing for an all-electric future.</p>\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202602/27/WS69a0d3d6a310d6866eb3a702.html\">China Daily</a></em>, Chinese scientists led by Chen Jun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and vice president of Nankai University in Tianjin, have developed a lithium metal battery that boasts an energy density of more than 700 watt-hours per kilogram and stable performance at extremely low temperatures. This marks a significant advancement in the production of high-energy batteries for electric vehicles. The research paper was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10210-6\">published on Thursday in the science journal <em>Nature</em></a><em>.</em> Here is the abstract to that journal entry, which was published on February 25, 2026:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">Electrolyte solvents for electrochemical devices have been dominated by oxygen (O)-based and nitrogen (N)-based ligands over the past decades, for which the dipole–ion (Li+, Na+ and so on) interaction usually lays the foundations of ion dissociation and transport but frustrates the charge transfer process at the electrolyte–electrode interface.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">Here, by synthesizing alkanes with monofluorinated structures, we show that fluorine (F)-based ligands with designed steric hindrance and Lewis basicity enable salt dissolution of more than 2 mol l. Among them, 1,3-difluoro-propane (DFP)-based Li-ion electrolyte is endowed with all merits for energy-dense and low-temperature batteries, including low viscosity (0.95 cp), high oxidation stability (&gt;4.9 V) and ionic conductivity of 0.29 mS cm at −70 °C.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">By incorporating F atoms in the first solvation shell, the weak F–Li+ coordination facilitates the Li plating/stripping process with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.7% and exchange current density one magnitude larger than O–Li+ coordination at −50 °C.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">The electrolytes further enable the operation of lithium-metal pouch cells under an electrolyte amount of less than 0.5 g Ah, achieving energy densities greater than 700 Wh kg at room temperature and about 400 Wh kg at −50 °C. The hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) electrolytes in this work provide a feasible approach to building electrochemical systems beyond traditional coordination chemistry.</p>\n<p>Okay, got all that? Here’s the plain language translation: Chen said the team has replaced oxygen atoms with fluorine ones. It designed and synthesized novel fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecules, which created a new electrolyte system based on lithium-fluorine coordination.</p>\n<p>Laboratory tests showed that the battery could achieve energy density above 700 watt-hours per kilogram, maintaining nearly 400 Wh/kg at -50°C. Energy density and low-temperature performance are the biggest bottlenecks hindering the widespread adoption of EVs, Chen said.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, his team redesigned the battery electrolyte at the molecular level. By developing fluorinated hydrocarbon solvent molecules and establishing a lithium-fluorine coordination system, the researchers improved ion transfer and enabled stable operation at ultrahigh energy densities and extremely low temperatures.</p>\n<p>“High-energy batteries using this electrolyte have vast potential in new energy vehicles, embodied intelligent robots and the low-altitude economy, as well as in polar regions, aerospace and aviation,” Chen said.</p>\n\n<p>The team has also made significant progress in advancing cutting-edge technologies toward practical applications. Earlier this month, the team collaborated with Chinese automaker Hongqi to release a mass-producible <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/19/faw-begins-testing-semi-solid-state-battery-with-500-wh-kg-energy-density/\">ultra-high energy density lithium-rich manganese solid-liquid battery system</a>. The system boasts a cell energy density exceeding 500 Wh/kg, which translates into a driving range of more than 1,000 kilometers on a single charge for equipped vehicles.</p>\n<p>Yan Zhenhua, a professor at Nankai University’s College of Chemistry, said the new battery uses a self-developed composite electrolyte that improves both safety and durability. “It not only achieves a leap in energy density but, more important, solves the high cost and high risk challenges associated with lithium metal batteries, significantly enhancing cycle life and intrinsic safety,” Yan added.</p>\n<p>Lu Tianjun, general manager of China Automotive New Energy Battery Technology, said that vehicles equipped with the batteries and capable of exceeding 1,000 kilometers per charge are expected to enter mass production by the end of this year. “This serves as a model and a leading example of collaboration between universities and enterprises.”</p>\n<p>“This battery, whether in terms of energy density, technological advancement or progress in application, represents a leading level both domestically and internationally,” Lu said. “Conservatively, its performance would mean an improvement of about 50 percent compared with current technologies.”</p>\n<p>Chen, the Nankai University researcher, said that translating scientific breakthroughs into practical technologies requires close collaboration between researchers and industry. “We can’t always stay in the ivory tower. Our goal is to address real industrial challenges.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tofu Brine To The Rescue!</h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><a href=\"https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Tofu-Brine-Battery-That-Could-End-the-Lithium-Era.html\">OilPrice.com</a></em> also has a report this week about a new <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/18/a-new-flow-battery-takes-on-the-data-center-energy-crisis/\">aqueous battery</a> developed by Chinese researchers that purports to be capable of 120,000 charge/discharge cycles. Aqueous batteries have not proven to be well suited for powering automobiles, but they could play an important role in battery energy storage systems. The typical life cycle limit for lithium-ion batteries is around 3,000 charge/discharge events. Once again, for our technically inclined readers, here is the abstract for this study, which was published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69384-2\"><em>Nature Communications</em> on February 18, 2026</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">The electrolytes of aqueous batteries are mostly acidic or alkaline, resulting in inevitable side reactions. More importantly, when batteries are disposed of, strongly acidic and alkaline solutions harm the environment.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">In this study, we synthesized covalent organic polymers as negative electrode materials for aqueous divalent ion (Mg2+ and Ca2+) storage, which exhibit favorable performance in electrolytes with a pH of 7.0 (the electrolytes are environmentally benign and can even be “brine” in tofu production).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">Polymers containing electron-donating linking bonds exhibit fast kinetics and low potential for use in aqueous Mg2+/Ca2+ batteries. In neutral electrolytes (pH = 7.0), Hexaketone-tetraaminodibenzo-p-dioxin covalent organic polymers exhibit 120,000 cycles and deliver specific capacities (up to 112.8 mA h/g).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">The negative electrode was paired with a positive electrode, creating a full cell that has a voltage interval of 2.2 V and achieves a specific energy of up to 48.3 Wh/kg, which is calculated on the basis of the total mass of the negative electrode, positive electrode, and electrolyte at the full cell level, together with long-term cycling stability over 120,000 cycles at a specific current of 20 A.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 80px;\">The full cells are environmentally benign and nontoxic and can be directly discarded to environments according to various standards (GB 18599-2020, ISO 14001, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA, US).</p>\n<p>“Compared with current aqueous battery systems … our system delivers exceptional long-term cycling stability and environmental friendliness under neutral conditions,” the research team said. It was composed of scientists from the City University of Hong Kong and Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen.</p>\n<p>“At over a hundred thousand cycles, this could mean a single water based battery could last at least a decade or so. For applications like grid storage (solar farms, wind balancing), that’s extremely valuable,” they claim.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-368961\"></span></p>\n<p>These tofu-brine batteries could prove safer and more environmentally friendly than lithium-ion batteries. According to the study authors, the full cells are environmentally benign and nontoxic and can be directly discarded to environments while meeting national and local disposal standards. Water based (also called aqueous) batteries can also be cheap to produce as they rely on ingredients that are far less costly than those used in conventional lithium-ion batteries.</p>\n<p>If this new tofu-brine battery proves scalable and applicable outside of a laboratory environment, it could be another step toward Beijing’s goal of near-total domination of clean energy technology value chains and status as the world’s first and premiere ‘electro-state,’ says OilPrice.com reporter Haley Zaremba.</p>\n<p>While other countries are aware of China’s dominance in clean energy technologies — largely because of its solid support of basic research — and are taking pains to protect and promote domestic battery manufacturing, those efforts may be too little, too late.</p>\n<p>“For globally competitive battery manufacturing industries to emerge outside of Asia over the next ten years, companies will need to do far more than ensure regulatory compliance,” summarizes a McKinsey &amp; Company report released in January. “Challenges will need to be overcome on multiple fronts spanning supply chains, talent management, operations and technology.”</p>\n<p>Putting up tariff barriers is one sure way to make sure that China wins while others — especially the US — are the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/27/maga-is-making-america-stupid-the-effects-will-be-felt-for-generations/\">biggest losers and left gasping on the side of the highway that leads to the future</a>.</p>\n<p>We have said many times here at <em>CleanTechnica</em> that the batteries in use in 2030 haven’t been invented yet. They will cost less and do more than any commercially available batteries of today and make the transition to an electricity based economy a no-brainer. When it comes to electro-states, the future’s so bright, you gotta wear sunglasses — especially if you happen to be China.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Tesla Vehicles Finally Come To Africa",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tesla recently announced that the company’s vehicles will now be available in an African country for the first time ever. Starting in the middle of this year, the Model 3 and Y will be available in Morocco. Morocco was always going to be the first one, given its proximity to Europe, where Tesla already has a big presence. Holiday makers from Europe have been taking their Teslas to Morocco for a long time now, and therefore Tesla opened a Supercharger network in Morocco a while ago. There is also a strong local Tesla fanbase there with Moroccans independently importing Teslas into the country. Now Moroccans will have official Tesla dealerships and can soon get brand new Teslas with full backup service and warranties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tesla did have some presence on the African continent before. A small office in Cape Town some years back focused on the energy side of Tesla’s business (Powerpacks). Powerwalls have been available in South Africa since the first-generation Powerwall. The Powerwall 3 is also now available in South Africa. Back to the vehicle side of things, it’s good to see another brand bridging in electric vehicles, albeit in one country for now. The continent has 54 countries, and if they do their due diligence properly, they could find more markets to get good sales. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s look at the overall Morocco market for example. In 2025, just over 235,000 brand new cars were sold in Morocco, up 33% from 2024. These were mostly ICE vehicles. Now let’s look at Africa’s largest market for new vehicle sales, South Africa. In 2025, just under 600,000 brand new vehicles were sold in South Africa in the overall market, the highest number in over a decade and up 15.7% year on year. That’s almost 3 times the number of vehicles sold in Morocco. Over 96% of these sales were ICE vehicles, though. So, South Africa presents a much larger addressable market and should have a bigger market for Tesla to take advantage of. In fact, South Africa is a larger vehicle market than a lot of countries where Tesla has had a presence for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tesla could also be encouraged by the fact that new brands seem to be catching on fast in South Africa. For example, two brands from Chery Group doing well in South Africa are Omoda and Jaecoo. Omoda &amp; Jaecoo South Africa sales have officially surpassed 20,000 total vehicles since launching in the local market in 2023. The brand has now achieved a cumulative sales figure of 20,857 units. Part of this growth has been fueled by growing market interest in electrified mobility. Plug-in hybrid sales from the brands continue to rise, with 590 SHS (Super Hybrid System) models already contributing to overall sales volumes. The J7 SHS, in particular, has shown strong momentum, with 317 units sold since its debut in June 2025. The C9 SHS, which carries a starting price of R999,900, has also performed well despite being the most premium offering in the Omoda &amp; Jaecoo lineup.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several countries now that have pro EV policies on the African continent and could be markets of interest for Tesla. It’s good to see that Tesla is at least now looking into the African market through this Morocco launch. Hopefully more markets will follow.</span></p>\n</div>",

But right now, we need to talk about the brutal macroeconomic physics that are about to hit every American driver.</p>\n<p>There is a very seductive narrative coming out of the regime right now: that these will be “surgical” strikes that “degrade capabilities” while supporting a popular uprising, paving the way for a swift, clean victory that will save democracy in the middle east and cost the American public nothing.</p>\n<p>I’m here to tell you that this is a fantasy.</p>\n<p>Whether you support the current man who identifies as president or not, and regardless of how you feel about regime change in Tehran, the inescapable reality is that the era of cheap, predictable gasoline just ended. When you analyze the military and market mechanics on the ground, we are looking at a 60% to 70% probability of a severe, sustained global oil shock that will likely drive national gasoline averages past $6 a gallon.</p>\n<p>If you are reading this and still driving a gas-powered vehicle, you are holding a live grenade in your wallet. Here is the cold, hard math on why it’s time to rethink your vehicle choices.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Single Highway Exit Problem</h3>\n<p>To understand the likely energy crisis we face, you don’t need a degree in geopolitics. You just need to look at a map. <a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/760ed8e8-38b6-4418-b527-6d8976da72e4/StraitofHormuzFactsheet.pdf\">Roughly 20% of the world’s seaborne oil trade</a> has to pass through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow, 21-mile-wide chokepoint between the Persian Gulf and the rest of the world’s oceans. Think of it as a single highway exit that serves an entire global economy.</p>\n<p>The administration’s fantasy relies on everything going perfectly so that exit stays open. It won’t.</p>\n<p>Iran’s military doctrine is based on asymmetric warfare. They know they cannot win a conventional battle against the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Their goal isn’t to “win”. Their goal is to inflict maximum economic chaos and outlast the political will of U.S. leadership. They know that with expensive fuel, Trump won’t have the power to do anything to them in about a year.</p>\n<p>And they don’t need to physically close the strait to do it. The global oil market runs on maritime insurance. You cannot sail a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) containing millions of dollars of oil without coverage. As soon as Iran deploys even a few naval mines or a handful of attack drones hit commercial tankers, the maritime insurance market will instantly self-destruct. Tankers will not sail into an uninsurable war zone without massive naval escorts, slowing the global flow of oil to a trickle.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Math Behind That $6 Gas</h3>\n<p>When that bottleneck is choked, global panic takes over. The math here is well-established by economists: for <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/1001\">every $10 increase in a barrel of crude oil, you pay roughly 25 cents more per gallon at the pump</a>.</p>\n<p>Before this morning, global crude was trading around $70 a barrel. In a “Wounded Bear” scenario where Iran survives the initial strikes and initiates a long-term, asymmetric shadow war involving mines and drones (which analysts assess as having a 45-50% probability), global crude will easily sustain a price of $130 to $140 a barrel as the “risk premium” becomes permanent.</p>\n<p>Add that $60 or $70 surge to crude, do the 25-cents-per-gallon math, and you add $1.50 to $1.75 to whatever you were paying last week, and then watch the prices keep climbing as long as the conflict continues to disrupt oil trade.</p>\n<p>Now, look at the other probable outcome: The “Sunk Cost” scenario (roughly 15-20% probability). This is where the initial airstrikes fail to induce regime change, the administration’s ego takes a hit, and “mission creep” spirals into a U.S. ground invasion. In a full ground war that physically destroys neighboring Saudi and Emirati production capability, crude prices would blow past $150 or even $180 a barrel.</p>\n<p>When you combine the likelihood of these future outcomes, you are staring at a 60% to 70% probability of a sustained, catastrophic physical supply shock. You are locked into $6, $7, or even $8 gasoline for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, a man known for having no restraint would have to grow up overnight, or everything would have to go perfectly for him (civilians somehow overthrow the Revolutionary Guard because some facilities got bombed).</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Era of Financial Self-Defense</h3>\n<p>This coming April, I’ll be hitting the road for my Charge To The Parks project. I’m doing a coast-to-coast run down Route 66 from LA to Chicago, and then continuing on to the Outer Banks. If I were attempting to drag my older travel trailer across the country with a diesel or gas truck right now, I’d be sweating bullets watching the news.</p>\n<p>But I’m not. I’ll be pulling that trailer with my Chevy Silverado EV LT. Between the truck’s massive battery pack and the custom solar and battery setup I’ve been wiring into the trailer, the direct sting of a global oil shock is essentially removed from my travel math.</p>\n<p>Picking up an EV is no longer just an environmental statement. It is a vital act of financial self-defense. Here is why an EV is the only logical move today:</p>\n<p><strong>The Domestic Shield</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php\">Petroleum accounts for less than 1% of U.S. utility-scale electricity generation</a>. Sunshine, wind, natural gas, and nuclear power are domestic. When you drive an EV, you are breaking the geopolitical tether to the world’s most unstable region. The U.S. power grid doesn’t rely on oil tankers dodging mines in the Persian Gulf.</p>\n<p><strong>Price Predictability</strong>. Electricity rates are regulated and stable. They might slowly change year over year, but they do not spike by 30% overnight because of a drone attack halfway across the world. An EV turns your “fuel” cost into a predictable utility bill, not a volatile stock market ticket.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ultimate Exit Strategy</strong>. This is the best part: if you have solar panels on your roof (or your travel trailer), you are making your own fuel. You have completely decoupled your personal mobility from global conflict, corporate greed, and political folly.</p>\n<p><strong>We are looking at a fork in the road</strong>. On one path, you continue to gamble on volatile global politics, accepting that $6 or $7 gas is your new baseline while your disposable income evaporates. On the other path, you leverage domestic energy, insulate your wallet, and take back control.</p>\n<p>The choice is yours, and by the time you read this, local new and used car dealers that sell EVs are probably open. If you don’t have one, get one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0710.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368945\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0710.jpeg\" width=\"400\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Featured image: A screenshot from Toy Story (1995) via Yarn (Fair Use).</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "UAW: Stellantis Can’t Blame Workers Or EVs For Losses",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>If you work the line at a Big Three automaker, late February is usually a time to celebrate. The annual profit-sharing checks get announced, and for the last few years, they’ve been absolute blockbusters.</p>\n<p>This year? The mood in Detroit depends entirely on whose badge is on your polo shirt.</p>\n<p>Over at General Motors, workers are looking at <a href=\"https://evrimagaci.org/gpt/stellantis-workers-face-first-profit-sharing-drought-since-2011-531666\">checks north of $10,500</a>. Ford workers aren’t far behind, netting nearly $6,780. But if you clock in at a Stellantis plant, <a href=\"https://www.crainsdetroit.com/automotive/profit-sharing-stellantis-uaw-workers-drops-0\">management just handed you a fat, depressing zero</a>. It’s the ultimate Clark Griswold moment. You work hard all year, you build the products that generate the revenue, and you expect that end-of-year bonus to reflect your sweat equity. Instead of a check, you get enrolled in the Jelly of the Month Club.</p>\n<p>Actually, no. The Jelly of the Month Club is the gift that keeps on giving the whole year (even if it doesn’t cover a swimming pool). What Stellantis management just handed its UAW workers is much worse. They handed them Cousin Eddie’s sewer hose.</p>\n<p>And true to form, instead of taking accountability for dropping a historic financial disaster on their employees’ lawns, Stellantis executives are trying to point the finger at the transition to electric vehicles.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The “Shitter Was Full” Defense</h3>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/1rfwy3r/stellantis_workers_go_off_on_0_profit_sharing/\">blistering internal letter released yesterday</a>, UAW Vice President Rich Boyer called out Stellantis management for a catastrophic 2025 that saw the company post a staggering <a href=\"https://intellectia.ai/blog/stellantis-profit-sharing-2025-analysis\">$26.4 billion global loss</a> and completely wipe out its North American profit margins. Boyer rightly pointed out that the company “prioritized shareholder payouts instead of investing in the future, and cut the heart and soul out of the plants to cover up the results.”</p>\n<p>Stellantis, meanwhile, has been crying to anyone who will listen that the “shift away from electric vehicles” and a “cooling market” forced their hand. They want to give EV advocates the same Cousin Eddie Merry Christmas they just gave the UAW.</p>\n<p>But we all know the truth: It’s Stellantis’s shitter that’s full, not the EV movement.</p>\n<p>Let’s get real for a second. While there are some cool people at Stellantis who care about electrifictation, Stellantis HQ didn’t even try to half-ass the EV transition. While Ford and GM were pouring billions into dedicated platforms, battery plants, and actual metal-on-the-road, Stellantis dragged its feet. They starved their product lines, jacked up the prices on their aging internal combustion Jeeps and Rams to eye-watering levels, and watched their North American market share evaporate. They made decisions to slash engineering, software development, and supplier budgets long before any “EV slowdown” materialized.</p>\n<p>You know I love the Wrangler 4xe, but that should have been step 1, not the whole game!</p>\n<p>Now, after investing a fraction of what their domestic rivals did into electrification, they want to use EVs as the scapegoat for their own executive boardroom failures.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Big Lie Doesn’t Work For Automakers</h3>\n<p>What we are witnessing is an attempt to pass off rank incompetence as victimhood. That’s a bold strategy, Cotton.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: There is only one Donald Trump. Trying to weaponize victimhood to cover up a trail of massive, undeniable failures in a “Big Lie” is a reality-distortion field that Trump can get away with (at least before he blundered his way into Iran and endangered the whole oil economy). He has a monopoly on that specific brand of Teflon.</p>\n<p>Nobody else can pull it off like he can, and certainly not a multinational conglomerate bleeding tens of billions of dollars. You can’t gaslight a balance sheet, and you sure as hell can’t gaslight a UAW worker who is staring at a $0 profit-sharing statement while their neighbor at the Chevy plant is putting a down payment on a new Silverado EV LT to tow their travel trailer.</p>\n<p>The UAW sees right through the corporate greed. EV advocates see right through the scapegoating. Stellantis made its own bed, and now it’s trying to make the workers and the clean energy transition sleep in it.</p>\n<p><em>Featured image: A screenshot from a Jeep commercial years ago flaunting a future electric Wrangler that can operate underwater (likely tongue firmly in cheek).

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>We typically report on Waymo and other US-based robotaxi companies, but one of the biggest robotaxi services in the world is Baidu’s Apollo Go. It first launched fully driverless robotaxis in China on July 20, 2022, and was the first company to launch them there.</p>\n<p>Now we have news that, as of this month, Apollo Go has provided 20 million rides — worldwide, as it does also offer robotaxi services in some locations outside of China. Note that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/12/17/waymo-reaches-20-million-passenger-trips/\">Waymo passed 20 million passenger trips</a> in December 2025.</p>\n<p>The company provided 3.4 million robotaxi trips in just the 4th quarter of last year. That was a 200% increase over the 4th quarter of 2024. In its peak week, the company provided 300,000 such trips.</p>\n<p>As has been done at all robotaxi companies, Apollo Go initially had humans in the vehicles supervising the autonomous driving. With those trips included, the company has now passed 300 million kilometers (186 million miles) of autonomous driving. Only counting the fully driverless trips, it has passed 190 million kilometers (118 million miles). That’s a lot of autonomous driving….</p>\n<p>Along with providing these stats to the world, Baidu just announced that Apollo Go service has launched in South Korea. That should be a hot market for the service.</p>\n<p>While most of Apollo Go’s business is conducted in Chain, the company has been expanding beyond China significantly. Uber &amp; Lyft are supposed to be <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/12/25/more-robotaxi-ride-hailing-partnerships/\">testing Apollo Go robotaxis in London this year</a>, A <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/27/swiss-public-transport-company-to-use-apollo-go-robotaxis/\">public transport company in Switzerland</a> is also starting to use them. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/09/lyft-apollo-go-to-go-after-europe/\">Apollo Go should be entering other parts of Europe</a> through Lyft this year as well. It is also <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/07/17/baidu-uber-partner-to-launch-thousands-of-robotaxis/\">getting into more markets in Asia and the Middle East</a> through Uber. A little more than a year ago, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/11/29/apollo-go-robotaxis-launch-in-hong-kong/\">Apollo Go robotaxis launched in Hong Kong</a>. I expect we’ll be hearing of its entry into several more markets through 2026. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>And, one has to wonder: will Apollo Go be able to pass up Waymo in robotaxi rides? Both of them are expanding rapidly, so it should be an interesting and tight race for robotaxi leadership in 2026. We shall see.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Range Anxiety Anxiety vs. Actual Electric Car Convenience",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Wow, time flies. An <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2014/11/09/electric-car-convenience-vs-range-anxiety-anxiety/\">old article</a> that I loved when we originally published it recently came to mind, and I quickly realized it was much more relevant today than it was back in November of 2014 when it was published. It also blows my mind that the article is more than 11 years old! Wow…. Funny enough, it was originally posted on Google+, which was a great social network I loved but that didn’t last. So, if we hadn’t reposted it back then, it would have been lost to history. Anyway, I’m going to repost it again in full, and then add a little more commentary at the end.</p>\n\n<p>Originally published on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AlbertBodenhamer/posts/iyXySTACkfi\" rel=\"”canonical”\">Google+</a>.<br/>\nBy Albert Bodenhamer</p>\n<p>I spend a fair bit of time following press on electric vehicles (EVs). I see stuff that’s pro-EV, anti-EV, and neutral. I see some good stuff, but a lot of poorly researched crap from every angle as well*.</p>\n<p>One thing that really bugs me is stories talking about the “huge disadvantage” EVs have in charging time and that “People don’t want to wait hours and hours for their cars to charge.”</p>\n<p>Stories like that create what I call “range anxiety anxiety”. Range anxiety is an infrequent thing, but people unfamiliar with electric cars read articles hyping short range and long charge times and they develop anxiety that they’d have range anxiety if they owned an EV.</p>\n<p>The problem isn’t in the statement itself, but in the underlying assumption. People are used to how gasmobiles work. You drive for a week or two on a tank, running it down close to empty (often inducing range anxiety). Then you stop at a gas station for a few minutes, drop 50+ bucks and then repeat the cycle. If you apply that model to an EV, it’s horrifying. Imagine getting up to go to work and your EV battery is empty! A Model S takes 10 hours to charge at a level 2 charger! I’d miss a whole day of work!!!</p>\n<p>What people don’t see is how idiotic that model is. They’ve trained themselves to put up with the nonsense gasmobiles create and they just assume it applies everywhere. If you offer to get rid of a major annoyance people experience all the time and are used to, but the cost is a new less-frequent annoyance that gets hyped by the press every 2 seconds, people will often pass on getting rid of the major annoyance.</p>\n<p>Think about the last time you had to put gas in your car. If you’re like me, you noticed the gas gauge getting low on your way home from work, but you were tired after a long day and decided to wait til morning. Morning always comes. It’s always the morning when everything is going wrong and you’re running late and you climb in the car, and “CRAP!” you’ve gotta get gas on the way to work.</p>\n<p>Imagine instead that a magic energy fairy showed up every night and refueled your car. All the fairy asks in return is that you pay about ¼ of what you used to pay in gas, and that you spend a bit more time and planning on long trips. That’s it.</p>\n<p>I took a look at my gas patterns before I bought the Model S and since. I used to buy gas about every 2 weeks. Each stop always added at least 10 minutes to my trip to or from work (I timed it). In the year and a half I’ve owned my Model S I would have made 40 gas stops**. That’s 6.5 hours I would have blown going out of my way when what I really wanted to be doing is getting on with life.</p>\n<p>EVs use a different pattern than gasmobiles do. They work like the magic energy fairy. I spend far less time recharging than I did buying gas. I just take two seconds to plug in at home and by morning I have a full battery again.</p>\n<p>There’s only once where I haven’t woken up to a full battery. I’d done a ton of driving the day before, down to downtown San Jose, up to El Sobrante and back, then back and forth to Mountain View. I pulled in at 10:30 that night with only 25 miles of range left on my car. It started charging at 12:30 and I had to leave again at 8 the next morning. I went out to leave and saw that the car was still charging. Oh no! I only had 190 miles of range to cover the 40 miles of driving I needed to do that day! I unplugged, went about my day, and the next day I woke to a full charge.</p>\n<p>The only time I wait for my car is if I’m on a road trip. Those are the exception and, for me at least, the convenience of not having to get gas the other 99% of the time easily outweighs the bit of extra time and planning I have to do on a long trip. For me, a road trip is when I’m explicitly NOT rushing. I just take my time and enjoy the drive. Most of my road trip charge stops are 20-45 minutes and I spend the time hitting the restroom, grabbing a quick bite, talking to other drivers, or just stretching my legs.</p>\n<p>There ARE some things that don’t really work yet due to lack of infrastructure, but those are getting better. They’re the reason I still wouldn’t have an EV as an ONLY car. In 2-3 years I expect those problems to be solved and I’ll dump gas for good.</p>\n<p>* The hyperbole-infested pro-EV/pro-Tesla stuff bothers me quite a bit. There are plenty of good reasons to own an EV. Spinning a bunch of BS doesn’t help anyone. I might write something on that later.<br/>\n** Actually, more than that. That’s just based on the driving <b>I</b> used to do in my old car. We now drive my wife’s car about half as much as we used to, and she buys gas much less often now too.</p>\n<p><em>About the Author: Albert is a science and tech geek, occasional gadfly, armchair philosopher, and avid hobby collector.
