            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>BEVs had a record month and represented 37% the total Chinese car market in September.</em></h4>\n<p>We saw plugins score another million-plus sales in September <em>(1.3 million plugins, in a 2.2-million-unit overall market, up 6% YoY),</em> but growth has been slowing down, with September showing a 16% increase over September 2024<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Digging deeper into the numbers, BEVs continued to grow, going up by 29% to 826,000 units, a new record, or 37% of overall sales. PHEVs were down again, this time by 3% YoY, to some 469,000 units. Counting both powertrains together, we get 1.3 million units, the second best month ever, and only a few thousand units below the all-time high set last December.</p>\n<p>With BEVs continuing to grow by double digits and PHEVs accumulating months in red, have we reached a turning point in PHEV adoption?</p>\n<p>These results pull the year-to-date (YTD) tally to over 8.9 million units. So, we should see plugins reach the <em>10 million unit</em> mark if not in October, then surely in November….</p>\n<p>This result pulled the September share to 58%, or 5% above the 53% result of September 2024. BEV share of the market rose to 37%. Expect to see plugins continue to grow their share in the following months. For now, plugins have 52% of the total auto market this year (32% just for BEVs), which means that <strong>most new cars sold in China this year have a plug!</strong></p>\n<p>(Could China reach 55% plugin vehicle share by year end? And be fully electrified before 2035?)</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding exports</strong>, in September, they were up 97% YoY. Plugins represented 40% of the total number of passenger cars exported from China, which means that exports are less electrified than domestic sales.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, much of the export market growth is coming from PHEVs. This technology now represents 33% of all Chinese plugin exports, whereas 12 months ago, it represented just 17% of total EV exports….</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362769\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1792\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2040px) 100vw, 2040px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September.png 2040w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-400x351.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-800x703.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-768x675.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Ranking-September-1536x1349.png 1536w\" width=\"2040\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>In the overall ranking</strong>, in September, fully fossil-fueled models had just two representatives in the top 10. The best placed was the Nissan Sylphy in 5th, a surprisingly good standing for the compact sedan, while the other 100% ICE model, the Geely Boyue, was something of a surprise. The Chinese crossover saw its sales double year-on-year, currently something of a rarity for an ICE model.</p>\n<p>Still, I believe it will be only a matter of time before we have just one pure ICE representative on the table. But it should still take some time until we see a 100% plugin top 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-A-Segment-Leaders-September.png\"><img

categories</strong>, all but the C segment (compact cars) have 100% plugin podiums. In fact, the C segment is the only segment where ICE models still have representatives<em>. </em>In all other categories, ICE models were absent. This is a recurring theme. So, it’s clear by now that the C segment is the hardest of all to convert into EVs.</p>\n<p>Looking at individual models, the biggest surprise was the podium for the full size category. Xiaomi’s YU7 won the category title in September, and on top of that, Xiaomi had its other model, the SU7 sports sedan, reach the category podium. However, the cell phone maker turned EV startup didn’t get a #1 + #2 win in the full size category this time, as the AITO M8 ended the month between the two Xiaomis.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, while the Wuling Mini EV (A segment) and Geely Xingyuan (B segment) dominate their categories, the BYD Song has disappeared from the midsize podium, giving way to the recently introduced BYD Sealion 06, which now has the role of racing against the Tesla Model Y.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362764\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-Model-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here’s more info and commentary on September’s top selling electric models:</p>\n<h3>#1 — Wuling HongGuang Mini EV</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_EV\">This tiny EV is taking full profit from its generation change</a>, which happened late last year. It is now back among the top sellers, and in September it collected <strong>51,743 registrations</strong>, a significant 79% increase year-on-year, allowing it to snap up the leadership position in that month, its first since July 2022. Thanks to a more rounded design, which kind of reminds of the face of a Panda, and upgraded specs and interiors, SAIC’s smallest hatchback has lost its barebones feel. It now looks more <em>car-like</em>. Wuling even offers a five-door version! Despite all of this, the price hasn’t increased that much, with SAIC’s star model starting at $5,500.</p>\n<h3><strong>#2 — Tesla Model Y</strong></h3>\n<p>Last year’s silver medalist had a <em>positive month</em> in September, growing 6% YoY to <strong>51,173 deliveries</strong>, in part thanks to its new 6-seat version. This provided it with a podium position. Tesla is clearly trying to stop the sales bleed with new variations, but will it be able to go back to the <em>good old days?</em> Unless Elon has a trick up his sleeve, I very much doubt it, especially with new competition like the Xiaomi YU7 and others like it. The YU7 <a href=\"https://carnewschina.com/2025/07/03/beyond-the-numbers-lei-juns-qa-on-xiaomi-yu7/\">got hundreds of thousands of locked-in orders within hours</a>. Those orders have to come from somewhere, and with the market already at 50% share, it won’t be just from ICE models…. Yep, Tesla, but also BYD, will suffer.</p>\n<h3><strong>#3 — Geely Geome Xingyuan</strong></h3>\n<p><em>Geely has struck gold with this one</em>. After a number of failed attempts to launch models that would stay in the best sellers table (Galaxy L6, Galaxy E5, etc.), the Hangzhou make finally found the winning formula to not only beat BYD, but also win the leadership race in the fierce Chinese automotive market. With BYD <em>owning</em> most of the market segments, thanks to multiple popular models, the little Xingyuan profited from the fact that BYD was underrepresented in the lower segments, which had left a space between the <em>A to B segment</em> Seagull and the <em>B to C segment</em> Dolphin. With pricing and specs closer to the Seagull, but with an interior space and quality closer to the Dolphin, the small Geely carved out a space of its own, which has been expanding in every passing month. This September, the small hatchback dropped to the last position on the podium, but it still managed once again to continue in <em>record mode </em>(for the ninth month in a row!) thanks to a best ever score of <strong>48,080 units</strong>. Starting with an 80,000 CNY (+/-$11,000) price, the buyer gets a 30 kWh LFP battery from CATL, which is nothing to write home about until you realize that its price is closer to the BYD Seagull’s (70,000 CNY for the 30 kWh version) than the BYD Dolphin’s (100,000 CNY). Exports? Surely that must be on the cards. But first, Geely will need to finish the production ramp-up and satisfy its own internal market.</p>\n<h3><strong>#4 — BYD Qin Plus (BEV+PHEV)</strong></h3>\n<p>The <em>old dog</em> once again joined the top 5 in September, thanks to <strong>39,132 registrations</strong>, a rather good performance. Its sales stayed essentially flat (+1% YoY), and it was once again the best selling BYD on the table. In the same period, its <em>brother in arms</em>, the Song, was down to less than half of last year’s sales! By the way, this was the second consecutive month without any BYD representative on the podium. Troubles ahead for the Shanzhen make? Back to the Qin’s performance, this volume meant that it was the best selling sedan in China, <em>all powertrains counted</em>. The 7-year-old body might be showing some wrinkles, but the low prices still provide significant demand for the sedan.</p>\n<h3>#5 — BYD Sealion 06 (BEV+PHEV)</h3>\n<p>BYD’s new midsize crossover scored <strong>30,532 registrations</strong>, which was a good performance considering it was only its second full month on the market, and allowed it to win its first top 5 standing, no doubt the first of many. But with the BYD Song apparently going into <em>EV Heaven</em> and the Song L failing to live up to the predecessor’s career, will the Seal 06 be the one to replace the Song on the top of the sales charts? It is positioned at around 150,000 CNY (around 22,000 USD) and has the standard BYD qualities of value for money, design and connectivity. On the EV specs side, the PHEV version has an above average 27 kWh battery, and the BEV version’s top battery has an unimpressive 79 kWh. Also, the 800V architecture is a plus at this price point. This means that the Sealion 06 has enough value for money to have a good career, but it will be difficult, if not impossible, to repeat the Song’s three-peat title streak (2022, ’23, and ’24), as the competition is increasingly more competitive and the Sealion 06 lacks standout features and specs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362775\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1909\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1381px) 100vw, 1381px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025.png 1381w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-579x800.png 579w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-768x1062.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/China-Top-Selling-EVs-September-2025-1111x1536.png 1111w\" width=\"1381\"/></a></p>\n<p>Looking at the rest of the best seller table, despite not having any representative on the podium, BYD took over of <em>all places</em> between 4th and 10th, with the Seagull (9th) and Song (10th) in unusually low places. While the SUV’s place can be justified by the fact that it is nearing the end of its career, the Seagull’s drop (-47% YoY) is harder to understand.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we have two fresh faces (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haval_Raptor\">Haval Raptor</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_YU7\">Xiaomi YU7</a>) that stayed on the table, and another that <i>just debuted in the top 20, </i>in the form of Changan’s Deepal S05.</p>\n<p>Outside the top 20, we have a number of models landing with a bang this month, with BAIC’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcfox_T1\">Arcfox T1</a> being the most impressive of them, not only because it scored a rare five-digit debut month, 10,096 registrations, but also because it is coming from the BAIC stable. BAIC is an OEM that has been outside the top positions in the past few years but has three Best Selling Model trophies in the bag (BAIC EC-Series in 2017 &amp; ’18 and BAIC EU-Series in 2019).</p>\n<p>The others were the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangchengbao_Ti7\">Fangchengbao Ti7</a>, another rugged SUV coming from BYD’s premium brand, that landed with 8,128 registrations, and the highly anticipated new generation <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPeng_P7\">Xpeng P7</a>, which started its career with a strong 8,104 registrations. All the while, the new generation MG 4 is already starting its career with a strong 11,790 registrations. So, although the new MG hatchback doesn’t look as sharp as the original one, it is already leaping ahead of the early sales results of the first generation. It will be interesting to see how the European market will react to it.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Geely Xingyuan consolidates power</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362765\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"2560\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1849px) 100vw, 1849px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-scaled.png 1849w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-289x400.png 289w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-578x800.png 578w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-768x1064.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1109x1536.png 1109w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-20-YTD-Model-January-September-1479x2048.png 1479w\" width=\"1849\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yep, looking at the 2025 ranking, the little hatchback seems poised to succeed the aging BYD Song as the best seller in China, and considering current sales trends, it seems the Geely model won’t leave that position anytime soon.</p>\n<p>If this trend gets confirmed and the Xingyuan wins the title this year, it will be a first for the Geely conglomerate, and the end of a three-year reign of the BYD Song. And to think that, up until this year, no model from the <em>Geely mothership</em> had even made it to the podium….</p>\n<p>Segment-wise, this would also be a significant change. After two years of podiums made up entirely of midsize models, 2025 could be the year that small cars regain protagonism on the podium.</p>\n<p>After all, the #3 Tesla Model Y has the tiny Wuling Mini EV just 5,000 units behind it. So, although the US crossover remains the favorite for the bronze medal, it is not impossible that the little city car could end in 3rd. Now, imagine that — two small EVs on the Chinese podium!

Despite a <em>so so</em> month in September (it saw its sales drop 15% YoY), the Tesla Model 3 benefitted from a horrible month from the Li Xiang L6 (down 52% YoY) to surpass it and reach the 10th spot.</p>\n<p>Further below, there was good news for BYD, with the Yuan Up climbing two positions in September to #13. But the Climber of the Month was the cute Changan Lumin, which jumped from 18th to 15th position.</p>\n<p>Finally, AITO’s M8 large SUV joined the table at #20.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362768\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1792\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2040px) 100vw, 2040px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September.png 2040w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-400x351.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-800x703.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-768x675.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-China-Top-Overall-Brands-Ranking-September-1536x1349.png 1536w\" width=\"2040\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Looking at the overall manufacturer ranking (not just electrics)</strong>, it seems BYD has found the demand ceiling in its domestic market. September was another month in red, as it saw its sales drop by a significant 16% YoY, the third month in a row of significant drops.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, #2 Geely is far from these issues, having seen its sales jump 62% September. This is while most foreign representatives are either stagnating or seeing sales drop. (Most, but not all — Audi was 10th thanks to enviable 11% growth YoY.)</p>\n<p>Above Audi, we have the other highlight of the month — fast-growing Leapmotor was at #9, thanks to almost 60,000 registrations. That’s an 85% jump YoY. The startup is currently at the top of its game, and <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2025/08/18/leapmotor-turns-profitable-h1-2025/#\"><em>now that it has become profitable</em></a>, the Valley of Death is behind the nine-year-old startup. A top 5 position seems not only possible, but likely.</p>\n<p>But Leapmotor’s startup leadership could be short-lived, because there are <em>two</em> unstoppable trains coming from behind Leapmotor. One is called Xiaomi (#15 in September, up 209% YoY), while the other is Xpeng (#19, up 201% YoY). Which one of them will be the best selling EV startup in 2025? Please place your bets.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Auto Brands Selling the Most Electric Vehicles in China</h3>\n<p><strong>Looking at the auto brand ranking for plugin vehicles</strong>, there isn’t much news.

            "title": "New Online Cost Calculator Aims To Rebuild EV Sales In The US",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Following the untimely demise of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, some analysts are taking an optimistic tack. They anticipate that automakers and dealerships will offset part of the loss with better deals and new incentives. That could help send EV sales ticking upwards again, but it’s not so simple. With so many different deals and incentives to choose from, how can prospective EV buyers be sure they get the best car for the money?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nonprofit Has A Plan To Restore EV Sales Momentum</h3>\n<p>To be clear, the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/ev-sales-outlook-bad-ev-charging-stations-good-what-is-going-on/\">collapse</a> of EV sales in October does not bode well for the future, at least over the near term. Rivian and General Motors are not waiting around for the dust to settle, either. According to news reports, both automakers have already started laying off workers at their EV facilities in the US.</p>\n<p>Still, the nonprofit organization Veloz is among those pointing out that the vast majority of current EV owners will stick with electric when they buy their next car. That should help sustain the EV market for the time being, at least to a modest degree.</p>\n<p>In a best-case scenario, EV sales will also get a boost from bargain-hunting gasmobile drivers who are new to the electric experience. These EV-curious drivers can use any number of online tools to figure out if their next car should be electric or not, but Veloz aims to level up the exercise with new resources that provide individual car owners with information specific to their area and driving habits.</p>\n<p>“With these new resources, we’re giving drivers an interactive, trusted way to learn, stay informed, and gain the confidence to make the move to electric,” Veloz Executive Director Josh D. Boone observed in a press statement.</p>\n<p>“Data shows that once drivers make the switch to an EV, they don’t go back to gas cars,” Boone emphasized. “The combination of lower costs, reduced maintenance, and a more enjoyable driving experience makes EVs not just practical but genuinely fun to drive.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">New Tools In The Vehicle Electrification Toolkit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/07/16/43-5-million-ad-campaign-to-boost-ev-sales-in-the-us-hopefully/\">Veloz</a> is not your ordinary EV advocacy group. The organization, which launched in 2017, received $43.5 million from Volkswagen’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/?s=electrify+america+volkswagen\">Electrify America</a> venture earlier this year. The funds were poured into a new public awareness campaign under Veloz’s <a href=\"https://www.electricforall.org/forward\">ElectricForAll.org</a> online portal, which now serves as host for the new EV search tools.</p>\n<p>The main attraction is a new gas and maintenance savings calculator. Aimed at underscoring the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) advantage of EVs, the calculator drills down into specific details relevant to each user.</p>\n<p>“Using highly precise data modeling, the interactive calculator forecasts an individual’s potential fuel and maintenance savings from switching to an EV, based on key real-life variables,” Veloz explains. Those variables include estimated miles of driving per year, type of car preferred, and the cost of gas in a driver’s area. The calculator also factors in the extent to which a driver anticipates using a home charging station or public chargers.</p>\n<p>Veloz also describes two additional tools:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>Used EV Finder:</strong> Drivers can enter their zip code in this user-friendly tool to instantly shop and compare used EVs available within a specific budget and geographic location on their device of choice.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><strong>EV Chat:</strong> This AI-powered assistant offers personalized conversations and answers questions about EVs, including topics from budget needs to addressing real-world concerns on what it is like to own an EV in your location.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">A DIY Angle On The EV Sales Recovery</h3>\n<p>As for whether or not any of this will make a difference in EV sales over the coming months, that remains to be seen. Ford and GM are among the automakers planning to introduce more affordable EVs that tip the TCO balance farther over to the side of electric drive, but those models won’t be rolling off the assembly line anytime soon.</p>\n<p>While Ford and GM represent a traditional sales and service model, the US startup Slate Auto is venturing into new territory that could also support an uptick in EV sales.</p>\n<p>Slate aims to attract car buyers in the DIY automotive ecosystem. Earlier this year the company unveiled its first offering, the stripped-down, customizable “Blank Slate” <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/29/slate-autos-new-ev-is-coming-for-your-gasmobile-your-cybertrucks/\">two-door electric pickup truck</a>.</p>\n<p>In the latest development, on October 28, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slate-engages-national-network-of-service-centers-for-accessory-installation-and-service-powered-by-repairpal-302597486.html\">Slate announced</a> that the Yelp-affiliated platform RepairPal will provide its customers with recommendations for certified service centers in their area.</p>\n<p>“Slate’s OEM partnership with RepairPal’s nationwide network of service centers will give Slate customers peace of mind, while empowering independent service shops to provide accessorization and service,” explained Slate COO Jeremy Snyder in a press statement.</p>\n<p>Although Slate encourages its customers to DIY their own customizations, most of them are more likely to seek help, and that’s where RepairPal comes in. “Slate believes that customers deserve the power to customize, accessorize, and repair their own vehicles, backed by the support of RepairPal’s network of highly skilled service technicians,” Slate explains.</p>\n<p>In particular, Slate anticipates that trained staff at RepairPal shops will take care of electrical and battery-related issues. “Over 200 locations across the U.S. are already certified by RepairPal to handle high-voltage repairs on electric vehicles,” Slate notes.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Finally, An Affordable Tesla … JK!</h3>\n<p>Of course, no story about EV sales in the US is complete without a mention of industry leader Tesla. The company’s brand reputation is circling the drain alongside the ongoing, Nazi-adjacent antics of <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/10/29/2351082/-Elon-Musk-still-a-big-fan-of-Germany-s-rising-ultra-rightwing-neoNazi-adjacent-party\">CEO Elon Musk</a>, but it still accounts for the biggest single slice of EV sales in the US, at <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/09/26/im-confused-tesla-hasnt-sold-out-of-cars-yet-in-usa/\">nearly 50%</a>.</p>\n<p>That share may go down as other EV makers edge closer to the more affordable mark of $25,000. Musk teased <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/07/25000-tesla-getting-really-really-close-two-thirds-no-cybertruck-survey/\">a $25,000 Tesla</a> back in December of 2023, but such a creature hasn’t materialized. Though, rumors of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/robyn-denholm-hints-at-cheaper-mass-market-tesla/\">a more affordable Tesla</a> resurfaced again recently.</p>\n<p>The forthcoming car, if it ever comes forth, is known by the codename Project Redwood, which is … an interesting coincidence! Redwood Materials is the name of <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/04/4-billion-for-ev-battery-recycling-an-answer-to-the-question-whatever-happened-to-jb-straubel/\">the EV battery recycling</a> startup launched by Tesla cofounder and former CTO JB Straubel.</p>\n<p>In the latest news from Redwood (the battery recycler, not the EV project), the company has just nailed down a Series E funding round of $350 million, with the firm Eclipse in the lead along with other participants.</p>\n<p>“This is a pivotal time for both Redwood and the United States, as curtailment in international supplies overlaps with intense domestic demand growth for these same materials and energy products,” Redwood stated.</p>\n<p>Hmmm … that sounds like an endorsement of the idea that the demand for EVs is not going away. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.</p>\n<p>I<em>mage (cropped): <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/lpo/ev-charging\">Electric vehicles</a> and EV charging station courtesy of US Department of Energy.</em></p>\n</div>",

We took several family trips to places like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Crater Lake, LA, Denver. Seven years later, we still have that car and we love it. One drawback, though, is the fast charging is very slow. Most EVs are bigger and better for long road trips.</p>\n<p>In 2022, we drove a Tesla Model Y 8300 miles round trip to the Canadian Maritimes. Other than having a few rentals, we were new to Tesla. That trip blew us away with the simplicity, superior performance, and fuel savings. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2022/09/09/8300-mile-ev-road-trip-washington-to-canadian-maritimes/\">Here’s a link to that long trip</a>.</p>\n<p>This week we returned from a trip to several national parks and family visits as far east as Washington, DC.

We retraced a portion of our 2022 trip across portions of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Interstate 90 was the first coast-to-coast EV-friendly corridor, completed in 2013. While there are still a few of those original Tesla chargers, which have a limited number of stalls and lower power compared to newer locations, we found so many newer charging locations with more and faster stalls that we rarely used the older ones.</p>\n<p>In Sheridan, WY, we were almost feeling nostalgic at the 4-stall Supercharger where we waited a few minutes for a free plug and then split the power with the car charging next to us. That only happened once. Everyplace else, even with lots of other EVs using the Tesla Superchargers, things are faster than before.</p>\n<p>As far as overnight charging, that’s also better. It was usually easy to find inexpensive motels near the places we wanted to visit with destination chargers on the premises or nearby, many of which cost nothing. On the other hand, with so many more fast chargers now in operation, some of which are also at or across the street from a hotel, you could also imagine not really caring about plugging in overnight during road trips.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-362739\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3.jpeg 2000w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-400x300.jpeg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-road-trip-3-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" width=\"2000\"/></a></p>\n<p>Not including the overnight charging, the average length of our charging stops was 17 minutes. This average was skewed by a small number of stops where we ate a meal or shopped and lingered longer than required. Generally, we tried to see if we could clean the windshield, use the restroom, and eat some snacks before the car indicated “you have enough charge to continue your trip.” The car was almost always ready to move on before we were. Similarly, we tried as much as possible not to stop except when the car said we needed to charge, but often we could not wait that long for the next restroom. 500-, 600-, and 700-mile days were even easy peasier than just 3 years ago.</p>\n<p>Although gas is cheaper now than three years ago, going by the national average for gasoline price and consumption ($3.16 and 27 mpg), the hypothetical ICE vehicle would’ve cost $727 for fuel, whereas we paid $499. Not that we could have fit the four of us plus all our stuff in that ICE car, nor would it have carried us along in the smoother, quieter, peppier EV experience we’ve come to expect, etc.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Another Self-Important Middle-Aged White Guy’s Pragmatic Climate Reset",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Another middle-aged white guy is offering a pragmatic climate reset, me. It seems to be the season for it. Bill Gates has pivoted from “zero carbon at all costs” to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/bill-gates-climate-crisis-pivot\">“improve human welfare first.”</a> Tony Blair has decided that <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/05/tony-blairs-new-climate-reset-report-promotes-delay-not-action/\">hard climate targets are too idealistic</a> and that a more rational plan is needed. Michael Liebreich is arguing for an <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-energy/liebreich-the-pragmatic-climate-reset-part-i/\">“affordable first 90%”</a> instead of chasing perfection. The language shifts, the presentation slide templates change, and yet here we are, back at the beginning. Everyone is rediscovering practicality, and apparently, we’re supposed to be grateful that reason is back in style.</p>\n<p>So, in the spirit of the moment, I’ll offer my own pragmatic reset. No grand reinvention. No billion-dollar breakthrough that will arrive in 2040. Just a calm review of what a realistic path actually looks like. Call it middle-aged realism, with coffee instead of cocktails, not that I remotely object to a decent cocktail.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the obvious one. Electrify everything. Cars, buses, trucks, furnaces, cooktops, and industrial heat where possible. Electricity is the most efficient energy vector humans have ever used. It doesn’t care what’s spinning the generator blades. When the power grid decarbonizes, everything connected to it decarbonizes. The cleanest watt is the one that never passes through an engine block or a smokestack. This is not theory anymore. The physics are simple, and the economics are lined up behind it.</p>\n<p>Once you commit to electrification, you have to build more renewable generation than you think. Overbuild it. Maybe 25% overbuild, just as every other form of generation except deeply inflexible nuclear has been built knowing it won’t run at maximum capacity. That’s not waste; that’s insurance. Energy abundance makes the transition politically viable because people stop worrying about scarcity. Solar and wind are already the cheapest sources of new energy across most of the planet. More turbines, more panels, fewer excuses. Every gigawatt of extra renewable capacity is a down payment on stability and affordability.</p>\n<p>Then, connect it all. A pragmatic world is an interconnected one. The power of electrons is that they move faster than any fuel train or pipeline. Build continent-scale grids, high-voltage direct-current lines that move energy from where it’s blowing or shining to where it’s needed. North America, Europe, China, and India all have enough geography to smooth out daily variability. The technology exists, and the payback in reliability is enormous. Integration is cheaper than isolation.</p>\n<p>Once you have renewables feeding the grid and wires spanning regions, you need to store what’s left over. This is where real-world pragmatism lives. We already have storage at scale: pumped hydro. It’s old, boring, and works every time. Complement it with batteries where fast response matters and it’s cheap, which is everywhere in this age of cheap cells. Use thermal storage where heat is useful, which once again is all over the place. Don’t fall for the fantasy that a miracle molecule or a new reactor design will solve variability. Storage isn’t exotic; it’s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Industry, of course, is the tough nut. Cement, steel, and ammonia account for a large share of global emissions. Yet here too, solutions are visible. Electric arc furnaces are already replacing blast furnaces. Alternative binders and carbon-mineralized concretes are moving from pilot to production. Biomethane direct reduction of iron is TRL 9. Ammonia made from renewable hydrogen is an obvious step. None of this needs to wait for fusion or moonshots. It just needs focus and investment.</p>\n<p>A real reset also includes the land beneath our feet. Plant trees, yes, but more importantly, manage soils intelligently. Restore peatlands, rotate crops, reduce tillage, and build carbon into the ground. Agriculture is both source and sink, and it responds to practical incentives. Nitrogen fixing agrigenetics, drone seeding and spraying, no till agriculture and precision agriculture are basic and proven tech. These aren’t romantic gestures. They are measurable carbon and resilience gains that feed people and stabilize ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Now for the part that economists have been repeating for decades. Price carbon. Stop pretending pollution is free. When we make people pay for what they emit, they emit less. It’s not punishment; it’s math. At the same time, end subsidies and financing for fossil fuels. Every public dollar spent on propping up declining industries is a dollar not spent on the future. If you want to see pragmatism in action, look at where money flows when it’s allowed to find efficiency.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the part everyone avoids talking about. We need to shut down coal and gas plants. Not in theory. In practice. Every megawatt of coal that closes makes space for a cleaner replacement. Every retired gas turbine is a step toward resilience. Create strategic plans for stopping using fossil fuel plants daily that keeps them around for the rarer and rarer occasions when they are needed. That is what real transition looks like: not burning fossil fuels all the time, not press releases.</p>\n<p>And while we’re fixing obvious problems, eliminate the short-lived climate pollutants. The Kigali Amendment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons is the quiet hero of climate policy. It targets chemicals that trap thousands of times more heat than CO2. Deal with methane too, with its 20 to 30 year residence and high global warming potential. Cap high emissions oil and gas leakage. Pivot biomass to biofuels, returning nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) to the soil as they aren’t required for energy for fuels. This is the kind of pragmatic win that rarely makes headlines but matters enormously.</p>\n<p>If you add all of this together, it’s not radical. It’s the same list engineers, modelers, and policy wonks have been building since the early 2000s. It’s what works. It’s affordable, scalable, and politically survivable. Everything else is distraction. Direct air capture sounds exciting, but it’s an energy sink. Nuclear remains a rounding error, even in China’s megaproject for breakfast economy. Small modular reactors are endlessly delayed. Hydrogen for cars is an answer to a question no one is asking anymore. Fusion is always just around the corner, which is another way of saying it isn’t here. Pragmatism means ignoring these glittering VC- and recidivist-funded diversions and sticking to what can actually scale.</p>\n<p>The funny part of this supposed “reset” is that none of it is new. We knew two decades ago that the future was electric, renewable, and interconnected. We knew the same carbon math, the same technology curves, the same physics. What changed is that fashionable voices rediscovered the old truths and gave them new names. Call it the circle of consultancy. This article just restates my short list of climate actions that will work, that haven’t really changed since I first <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2019/09/29/the-short-list-of-climate-actions-that-will-work/\">published them six years ago</a>, not claiming that they were in any way innovative or unique.</p>\n<p>The current wave of pragmatic climate resets isn’t all equal. Michael Liebreich’s version is by far the most constructive, grounded in data and tempered by hard-won experience. His argument that we should focus on decarbonizing the first 90% quickly, affordably, and politically securely is a useful correction to both ideological purity and defeatism. He still believes in building things, measuring outcomes, and calling out nonsense when he sees it. His “reset” is the most grounded in political and thermodynamic reality, mostly calling for a rebranding and reframing of communication and politics.</p>\n<p>Tony Blair’s reset, on the other hand, feels like resignation wrapped in gravitas. His appeal to realism mostly just licenses delay, offering a soothing vocabulary for staying comfortable. Bill Gates has wandered even further, reframing climate change as something secondary to welfare or health, as if stability in the climate and prosperity for people were separate goals. His new humility toward warming sounds reasonable but quietly lowers the bar. Of the three, only Liebreich’s version still treats pragmatism as forward motion rather than surrender.</p>\n<p>So yes, this is another middle-aged white guy’s pragmatic climate reset. Except it isn’t a reset at all. It’s the same short list I’ve been repeating for years, and the same one many others have been repeating since the beginning of this century. If it sounds new, that’s only because a lot of nonsense has been dominating the airwaves in recent years, hydrogen and SMRs chief among them Pragmatism never went anywhere. It just waited for attention to return. The only real reset is remembering what already works and finally doing it at scale.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Last month, Dr Andrew Forrest announced significant partnerships with BYD, Longi, and Envision to fight against climate change. He was in New York, attending the UN and taking part in New York’s climate week. Dr Forrest is an Australian billionaire and the non-executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group. You can read about his call for “net zero” and some of the practical steps he has taken <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/12/09/steps-to-achieving-real-zero-at-fortescue/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortescue.com/en/articles/fortescue-unites-worlds-best-technology-and-manufacturing-to-accelerate-decarbonisation-globally\">He declares</a> that the fight against the catastrophic impacts of climate change requires collaboration between countries, industries, and economic sectors. He is pushing for partnerships that will accelerate industrial decarbonisation by building an energy system that “outcompetes and out prices fossil fuels.” And he is doing it in an industry which has long been declared hard to decarbonise. “You can’t do that!” “Yes, we can!”</p>\n<p>“The fight against climate change cannot be won by one country, one company or one continent alone. It requires collaboration across borders, supply chains and industries.” </p>\n\n<p>By 2030, Fortescue is aiming to reach real zero, by “linking the Pilbara’s world-leading operational expertise, America’s and Australia’s research and development strength, the UK’s and Europe’s innovation and engineering excellence and anchoring it all with scale and cost-efficient manufacturing capability in China and the US. Together, this creates a powerful multilateral network of commercial cooperation to accelerate decarbonisation and defeat mankind’s greatest threat — global warming.”<br/>Fortescue is partnering with BYD — not just the world’s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, but also of batteries and energy storage systems. While BYD will supply energy storage solutions, Longi is one of the world’s largest solar technology companies and will supply its photovoltaic modules and solar technology. Solar has proven itself to be the lowest cost form of green energy generation. Envision will supply advanced wind turbine technologies for diverse energy sources.</p>\n<p>These power sources will recharge battery electric haulage trucks supplied by XCMG of China and Liebherr of Germany. Liebherr’s T 264 trucks are already helping to decarbonise Fortescue’s mining fleet in Virginia in the United States. XCMG is expected to supply up to half of Fortescue’s future fleet of 300 to 400 zero-emissions 240-tonne haul trucks from 2028 to 2030. Liebherr is expected to provide the other half of the fleet, as well as electric excavators from its manufacturing facilities in the USA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortescue.com/en/about-fortescue/our-story\">Fortescue Zero</a> delivers technology solutions through world leading research utilising the Colorado Technology Hub in the United States, advanced technology collaborations with CSIRO in Australia and its R&amp;D centre at Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Spanish company Nabrawind will supply Fortescue with its innovative self-lifting tower design. This design facilitates turbines (to be supplied by Envision) to be installed at greater heights (up to 188 metres) in the Pilbara (Western Australia), capturing stronger winds and generating more power. Fortescue has acquired 100 percent of Nabrawind. Envision will supply its EN 182-7.8 MW turbines for Fortescue’s inaugural wind project. These turbines are engineered to perform in a full range of wind conditions, from low wind to cyclonic conditions. The first turbine is slated to be installed next year.</p>\n<p>A recent study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.preventionweb.net/news/worlds-largest-fossil-fuel-and-cement-producers-are-responsible-about-half-intensity-recent\"><em>Nature</em></a> attributed deadly extreme heat events to carbon emissions generated by 180 of the world’s largest fossil fuel and cement producers. One of the takeaways from the report is that “source attribution could help power litigation…. Some of these extreme heat events would have been virtually impossible without climate change,” the researchers at the university ETH Zurich in Switzerland have concluded. A previous study suggested “that 111 carbon majors are responsible for $28 trillion in global economic losses stemming from extreme heat over the period 1991 to 2020.”</p>\n<p>Researchers Christopher Callahan and Justin Mankin state: “If you have made contributions to emissions, you have made contributions to extreme heat.” Lawsuits are currently underway. </p>\n<p>While not an emitter at this level, Fortescue is aiming to be part of the solution, not the problem. Fossil fuel reliant industries face growing legal, regulatory, financial, and reputational risks. The need for practical decarbonisation is urgent. I see the work of Fortescue as not only progressing its own growth and profit but also setting an example for other “hard to decarbonise” mining industries. See <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/27/rio-tinto-goes-its-own-way-with-renewable-energy/\">the recent <em>CleanTechnica</em> article about Rio Tinto’s efforts</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortescue CEO Dino Otranto says Fortescue is making progress in its bid to cut the 900 million litres of diesel it uses per year. Rapidly changing technologies give Otranto hope that “real zero” can be achieved by 2030. “(We can) demonstrate to the world that this is about economics, not just climate change.” After all, the Pilbara receives over 3000 hours of sun a year. This will enable the production of iron ore with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. Fortescue has not yet given up on green hydrogen to make green steel, but still has to solve the problem of expensive electrolysers.

            "title": "Canada May Remove 100 Percent Tariff On Chinese Made Cars",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>There is a rumor flying around the interwebs that Canada is considering a plan that would remove its current 100 percent tariff on electric cars manufactured in China. According to <em><a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2025/10/28/canada-considering-scrapping-tariff-chinese-ev-report/\">CnEVPost</a></em>, the Canadian prime minister Mark Carney is currently visiting a number of Asian countries.</p>\n<p>In August 2024, Canada added a 100 percent tariff on top of the 6.1 percent tariff that had been imposed on vehicles imported from China previously. The additional tariff was intended to support the US, which also imposed a 100 percent additional tariff on Chinese cars to protect the US auto industry.</p>\n<p>Carney’s itinerary will take him to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. Along the way, he will attend the ASEAN Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, that begins on October 31. He is said to be seeking to establish a “strategic relationship” with China while also aiming to hold talks with Chinese leaders during the APEC summit, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/carney-hopes-to-meet-china-s-xi-soon-in-bid-to-ease-trade-tensions\">Bloomberg</a></em>.</p>\n<p>A press officer for Carney said the prime minister believes firmly in talking to everyone as he seeks new strategic partnerships for Canada. He has been clear about areas in which China and Canada can and cannot cooperate. His goal is to further Canada’s interests and build out good opportunities for Canadian industries.</p>\n<p>Carney met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in New York last month and the two committed to continued engagement, including at the “highest levels” of government. The G20 Summit in South Africa in late November will be another opportunity for Carney and Xi Jinping to meet, an official told <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p>\n<p>While he is in South Korea, Carney will meet with President Lee Jae Myung to discuss opportunities for collaboration in critical minerals, energy, and defense. He will also attend a working dinner with Australia’s Anthony Albanese and New Zealand’s Christopher Luxon.</p>\n<p>There are also plans for Carney to visit the Hanwha Ocean submarine manufacturing facility. Canada is considering awarding a multi-billion-dollar contract to the Korean company while also exploring a bid by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems backed by Germany and Norway. Defense ministers from those two nations traveled to Ottawa recently to make their case to Carney and Canadian officials. A nation just south of Canada also manufacturers submarines, but for some reason, Canada is not looking to source its new boats from that country.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">China Retaliates On Tariffs</h3>\n<p>To counter the Canadian <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/13/tariffs-are-a-distraction-the-end-of-globalization-is-a-myth/\">100 percent tariff</a> on Chinese made cars and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum form China, the government of Xi Jinping has imposed punitive tariffs on Canadian canola, seafood, and pork.</p>\n<p>Carney has pushed to improve relations with Beijing. Canada’s foreign minister visited the Chinese capital to meet with her counterpart earlier this month. But Carney faces a challenge in trying to improve relations with China while delicate trade talks with the US are ongoing. The US is Canada’s largest trading partner by far.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">A Staunch Ally No More</h3>\n<p>Canada has been a staunch ally of the United States for over a hundred years. When the US was trying to exit Vietnam, Canadian troops helped stabilize that country until after US troops were withdrawn safely. When the US decided to invade Kuwait or Iraq, Canadian forces stood shoulder to shoulder with their US counterparts.</p>\n<p>All that changed when the Fat Felon installed himself and his coterie of sycophants in the White House last January. The Moron of Mar-A-Loco immediately started shooting his mouth off about Canada becoming the 51st US state — by force if necessary. Since then, Canadians have learned the US is not to be trusted. Carney and his administration were shocked to find that the US was <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/02/the-effect-of-tariffs-on-the-auto-industry-its-not-just-ev-manufacturers-that-are-hurting/\">now a sworn adversary</a> and all those decades of friendly relations were just a distant memory.</p>\n<p>Carney has focused on finding new trading and political partners for Canada. This latest rumor, first reported by Chinese news source <a href=\"https://www.thewirechina.com/2025/10/26/canada-set-to-side-with-china-on-evs/\"><em>The Wire China</em>,</a> will be a severe blow to whatever friendly relations remain between the US and Canada, if true.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Canada &amp; US Cross-Border Cooperation</h3>\n<p>For generations, GM, Ford, and Chrysler have operated factories in Canada, primarily in and around Windsor, Ontario, which is just across the Detroit River from Detroit. In practice, many components that go into the vehicles sold by those companies in the US are imported from Canada. Engines and transmissions in particular are often manufactured in Canada for the Big Three.</p>\n<p>In fact, thanks to the free trade agreements between the two countries, the body of a new car may be stamped out in Detroit, then sent to Canada for the engine and transmission to be installed, then sent back to the US for the seats and interior to be added, then shipped back to Canada for other components to be included, before returning to the US one last time before the finished car is shipped to a dealer.</p>\n<p>David Booth, writing for Canadian online blog <em><a href=\"https://driving.ca/column/motor-mouth/canada-chinese-ev-electric-vehicle-tariff-mark-carney-trump-auto-industry\">Driving</a></em>, has some thoughts on the rumors about Canada reducing tariffs on Chinese made cars. He urges Carney and company not to eliminate the 100 percent tariff entirely, as doing so could devastate what is left of the Canadian auto manufacturing industry.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The EU Model</h3>\n<p>Instead, he suggested that Canada should follow the path chosen by the European Union, which imposes <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/06/19/push-for-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-in-brazil-as-byd-comes-to-town/\">tariffs</a> based on how much of a subsidy each manufacturer has received from the Chinese government, according to the EU. He thinks the Canadian International Trade Tribunal could handle that task expertly and expeditiously. At the present time, BYD is subject to a 17 percent tariff in the EU, while SAIC — which refused to cooperate with the European Commission — pays that top rate of 35.3 percent.</p>\n<p>The Canadian tariffs should be “high enough that Chinese-sourced cars would not run roughshod over our own local industry — the Detroit Three as well as Honda and Toyota — yet be sufficiently competitive that it would put a scare into the [so-called US president],” Booth said.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Will US Customers React?</h3>\n<p>Just imagine what the reaction will be when US new car buyers learn that Canadians can purchase <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/05/tariffs-electric-cars-bloomberg-says-its-time-to-welcome-chinese-cars-to-the-us/\">competitive electric cars</a> from BYD, XPENG, NIO, and others for less money than they are paying for the highly polluting vehicles Detroit is offering! There is always the possibility that one or more of those Chinese companies may decide to build factories in Canada — literally within sight of the US border.</p>\n<p>The pudgy potentate will learn soon enough that he may have signed a death warrant for the US automotive industry with all his bombast and bluster, and all because he surrounds himself with know-nothing ideologues who have no actual experience running businesses in the real world. He thinks all it takes to govern is to run around shouting “You’re fired!” at the top of his lungs. There’s actually quite a bit more to it than that, as he will learn one day soon to his sorrow.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Hyundai Pushes Hydrogen Cars In Japan 😂",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>It appears that Japan is still obsessed with the idea of a hydrogen economy, and some automakers continue to pretend — of fool themselves with the notion — that hydrogen fuel cell cars have a future. Hyundai is one that, honestly, surprises me. The company seems like it most has its head on straight. It has been a leader in developing efficient, capable battery-electric vehicles with solid tech. Before all of that, it scaled up for decades from a small brand to one of the largest in the world. But it continues to spend money on a nonsensical hydrogen fuel cell car program that is, clearly, going nowhere.</p>\n<p>Japan Mobility Show 2025 is underway, and what better place to pump up the hydrogen hype again than in Japan, the country that has been the biggest proponent (among many proponents) of a hypothetical hydrogen economy. So, rather than focusing on a battery electric vehicle, this is the title of the <a href=\"https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/newsroom/detail/hyundai-motor-showcases-hydrogen-leadership-at-japan-mobility-show-2025-with-all-new-nexo--0000001037\">press release</a> Hyundai put out today: “Hyundai Motor Showcases Hydrogen Leadership at Japan Mobility Show 2025 with All-New NEXO.” Oy. I honestly don’t know if we should laugh or cry.</p>\n<p>“Hyundai Motor Company unveiled the all-new NEXO fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) at the Japan Mobility Show 2025, marking the vehicle’s debut in Japan and underscoring the company’s commitment to hydrogen innovation and sustainable mobility,” the company starts out.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Hyundai also has battery-electric vehicles to highlight and promote. “The all-new NEXO joins Hyundai Motor’s expansive portfolio of electrified vehicles on display in Tokyo, including the INSTEROID concept car, the award-winning IONIQ 5, and the INSTER Cross,” Hyundai adds. Those are all fun, cool, interesting battery-electric cars. Admittedly, though, the INSTEROID concept car is not a consumer vehicle and will never really be one.</p>\n<p>“Together, the lineup highlights Hyundai Motor’s diverse electrification capabilities and commitment to providing innovative mobility solutions to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving automotive landscape.” Well … that’s debatable.</p>\n<p>Notably, though, it seems Hyundai is intent on growing its market presence in Japan, which is notoriously hard for foreign automakers to make much progress in. Perhaps the hydrogen angle is just all about currying favor there, with the powers that be and the public at large. “This year’s Japan Mobility Show marks Hyundai Motor’s largest public activation in the Japanese market to date. As part of its efforts to strengthen market presence, the company views the event as a strategic opportunity to further grow visibility and engage younger, environmentally conscious audiences through its industry leading electrification technologies. Hyundai Motor aims to demonstrate its electrification and hydrogen vision in a way that resonates with Japanese consumers through its product showcase and immersive experiences.”</p>\n<p>“In the first half of next year, we plan to introduce the all new NEXO, actively joining Japan’s electrification movement,” Yoo Seok Chung, Executive Vice President at Hyundai Motor Company, adds. “Additionally, through customer community activities such as the ‘Hyundai Motor Club Japan’, we will continue to listen to our customers’ voices. By expanding exchanges between Korean and Japanese owners, we aim to deepen mutual understanding and brand experiences between the two countries, establishing ourselves as a truly authentic brand.”</p>\n<p>There’s more on the hydrogen stuff in there, but I’m just going to leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Good on Hyundai for trying to make a splash in Japan and get more market share, especially in the electric vehicle segment.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "EV Sales Outlook Bad, EV Charging Stations Good: What Is Going On?",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>The much-anticipated downward slide in US electric vehicle sales is well underway, now that 30 days have passed since the premature demise of the federal EV tax credit. Nevertheless, some analysts already anticipate that sales will pick up again by 2030, and stakeholders in the EV charging station field are already anticipating as much.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">All The Bad News About EV Sales In The US</h3>\n<p>The pace of EV sales in the US was absolutely sizzling in the weeks leading up to the September 30 drop-dead date for the federal EV tax credit. Check out <em>CleanTechnica’s</em> coverage <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/tag/us-ev-sales/\">here</a>, and then take a look at the Cox Automotive forecast for October. “Moving forward, the EV segment will be charting a new path, unsupported by government-backed sales incentives,” Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbro noted on October 27.</p>\n<p>“The EV sales story will really change going forward from here,” he added. “<a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/cox-automotive-forecast-oct-2025-u-s-auto-sales-forecast/\">Sales of EVs and PHEVs</a> are expected to collapse in October as tax credits expire.”</p>\n<p>J.D. Power also has an October forecast in hand. The firm calculates that EVs will claim only a 5.2% share of new-vehicle sales in the US for the month of October. That’s a sharp contrast with last month, when EVs accounted for 12.9% of new-vehicle sales as buyers rushed to beat the September 30 deadline, representing a new, albeit short-lived, peak for EV sales in the US.</p>\n<p>Bad news aside, the head of J.D. Power’s data and analytics division, Thomas King, noted that the fallout was not as severe as expected. “Despite the sharp deterioration in EV sales, the decline could have been worse,” he explained. “Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">EV Sales Set To Almost Double Their Peak Market Share By 2030, Maybe</h3>\n<p>On the brighter side, <em>E&amp;E News</em> cites Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, who foresees <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/ev-sales-look-promising-later-this-decade-analyst-says/\">a 24% market share for EVs</a> in 2030. That’s substantially less than the 2o30 forecast of <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/us-government-publishes-updated-emissions-projections\">a 50% share for EVs</a> put out during the last weeks of the Biden administration, but it does suggest that Streaty is also reading something about affordability in the EV tea leaves.</p>\n<p>That outlook is supported by two key auto industry developments in August. Ford and GM both announced ambitious <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/11/ford-unveils-new-affordable-ev-plan-lower-cost-of-ownership-over-five-years-than-a-three-year-old-used-tesla-model-y/\">new EV manufacturing plans</a> highlighted by the forthcoming launch of more affordable models using new, less costly <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/08/08/general-motors-weathers-tariff-storm-to-pursue-1-spot-in-ev-sales/\">LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) batteries</a>.</p>\n<p>That was a full month after the Republican majority in Congress passed the new budget bill that terminated the EV tax credit, suggesting confidence in the long-term outlook for EV sales.</p>\n<p>Short-term, the outlook is not so great. However, the US auto industry has been playing Whack-a-Mole with the tastes of the vehicle-owning public for more than a century, retooling factories, opening factories, and closing factories as the market dictates. Given that history, a pullback today does not necessarily mean a permanent slide into oblivion for EV sales in the US.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">More EV Charging Stations For More EVs</h3>\n<p>Another indicator of a comeback for EV sales is continued activity in the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/08/why-are-more-ev-charging-stations-coming-to-the-us-if-evs-are-a-dead-end/\">public EV fast-charging network</a> area. Work has kept up a breakneck pace all year, notably among travel centers, quick-serve restaurants, and other retail locations competing for drive-and-park customers.</p>\n<p>US President Donald Trump tried to put a crimp in the action earlier this year when he abruptly suspended the federally funded, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/02/16/nascar-blows-off-trumps-attack-on-ev-charging-stations/\">$5 billion NEVI fast-charging station program</a>. However, the US system of checks and balances is still functioning here and there. Earlier this month a judge <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/03/the-nevi-ev-charging-program-really-is-actually-back-on-track/\">ordered the funding restored</a>.</p>\n<p>That explains the latest news from Kempower, a leading manufacturer of fast-charging stations based in Finland. Earlier today, the company’s US branch announced that the NEVI program is supporting the installation of <a href=\"https://kempower.com/news/kempower-expands-us-footprint-with-new-powerup-sites-across-the-southeast/\">eight new fast-charging sites</a> in the Southeast US, outfitted by Kempower in partnership with the EV charging network <a href=\"https://powerupamerica.com/\">PowerUp America</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Partisan Politics Or Not, Red States Are Going Green</h3>\n<p>Considering the partisan political divide over cleantech in general and EVs in particular, that focus on the Southeast may seem out of touch with reality. Although two of the sites are in the purplish state of Virginia, five will go to the Republican trifecta state of Tennessee. The eighth site is slated for Kentucky, where President Trump coasted to a victory by more than 30 percentage points in last year’s elections.</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, Kempower already has a manufacturing footprint in the US and it is following the money. “Kempower’s partnership with PowerUp represents one of its most significant North American undertakings to date, advancing access to high-power charging infrastructure across a critical region for EV adoption,” Kempower explained in a press statement earlier today.</p>\n<p>“The Southeast is one of the most dynamic EV charging markets in the country,” added Monil Malhotra, President of Kempower North America.</p>\n<p>PowerUp has been focusing on the Southeast market, too. “The company’s strategic investments across the region, including the awarded NEVI sites, reflect PowerUp’s long-term vision to build resilient, accessible, and future-ready charging infrastructure,” Kempower notes.</p>\n<p>PowerUp CEO Josh Turner also chipped in his two cents. “Working with Kempower ensures our sites deliver the performance, reliability, and state-of-the-art quality drivers deserve as the EV landscape continues to evolve,” Turner explained.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">EV Sales In The Southeast</h3>\n<p>So, what is really going on with EV sales in the Southeast, where red state politics have collided with the region’s EV manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p>In September, the Southeast Alliance for Clean Energy took note of the damage already done by Trump and his Republican allies in Congress. “Thanks to the loss of consumer and manufacturing incentives, along with broader market uncertainty caused by <a href=\"https://cleanenergy.org/news/new-report-confirms-the-southeast-electric-vehicle-market-shows-no-signs-of-slowing-down-yet/\">the political flip-flop on EVs</a>, the Southeast is already seeing planned manufacturing projects paused or canceled,” SACE observes. “This trend is further exacerbated by trade tariffs that are expected to increase costs across the automotive industry.”</p>\n<p>Still, when SACE ran the numbers earlier this year, they spotted signs that EV sales in the region were on track to outpace the rest of the country:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“Here, the data speaks for itself; sales rose 38% from last year, and market share–the percentage of all new car sales that were EVs–climbed to 8.3%, despite a dip for all states in Q2, except Florida, which rocketed above the national average to an all-time high of 10.3%.”</p>\n<p>“The number of sales generated by legacy car companies also continued to increase, including at General Motors and Ford,” SACE added.</p>\n<p>So, will the Southeast emerge as a beacon of hope for EV sales as the US vehicle electrification movement struggles through the remainder of Trump’s term in office? And who or what will <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/29/study-showing-elon-musk-politics-cost-tesla-1-million-sales-is-wrong/\">replace EV industry leader Tesla</a> as the company’s brand reputation continues to rot from within? If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.</p>\n<p><em>Photo (cropped): The sudden collapse of EV sales in the US notwithstanding, the Finnish firm Kempower foresees a healthy market for <a href=\"https://kempower.com/news/kempower-expands-us-footprint-with-new-powerup-sites-across-the-southeast/\">EV charging stations</a> over the long term (courtesy of Kempower).</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Robyn Denholm Hints At Cheaper Mass Market Tesla",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>When was the last time anyone heard Robyn Denholm, the chair of the Tesla board of directors, say anything about the products the company manufactures? Usually, she is in the background acting as the head cheerleader for the next ginormous pay package for Elon Musk and praising him to the skies.</p>\n<p>So, it was somewhat of a surprise this week when she sat for an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/tesla-s-cybercab-backup-plan-selling-it-with-a-steering-wheel\">interview with <em>Bloomberg</em></a> on October 28, 2025, and announced the so-called Cybercab — the car that Elon himself has said will be the fully autonomous robotaxi he has championed for years — will in fact be the basis of the next new model from Tesla. “If we have to have a steering wheel, it can have a steering wheel and pedals,” she told <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Kara Carlson and Craig Trudell.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tesla &amp; FMVSS</h3>\n<p>The reason for the change of heart is that the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require all vehicles sold in the US to have a steering wheel and pedals. This, of course, triggers Musk’s now famous tirades about government overreach and stupid rules that prevent him from doing what his highly advanced brain tells him he should be doing.</p>\n<p>There are exceptions to the FMVSS rules. A company can get permission to build up to 2,500 non-conforming vehicles — cars without steering wheels and pedals — each year, but that is far too few for any new model that aspires to be a mass market vehicle.</p>\n<p>Obtaining such an exemption is extremely difficult. General Motors tried for two years to obtain an exemption for its Cruise Origin autonomous shuttle, but the approval never came through, which was reportedly the primary reason why GM closed down its Cruise division.</p>\n<p>Waymo began nearly 30 years ago as a Google entrant into a DARPA contest for self-driving vehicles in the Mojave Desert. That program became part of Alphabet when it was created as the parent company for Google. For a while, tiny two-seat autonomous cars with no steering wheels or pedals — that looked like they escaped from the set of a <em>Cars</em> movie — were running around a test track on the roof of a corporate building in California. Today, Waymo is a leader in autonomous robots in America using regular production vehicles that have been modified to accept the self-driving package of sensor and software the company has developed over the years.</p>\n<p>Those cars all have steering wheels and brake pedals, because FMVSS requires them, but they have no human drivers. The fact that the federal government will <em>not</em> allow vehicles on US roads that don’t have steering wheels and pedals but <em>will</em> allow them to be operated on public roads without a human onboard to turn the steering wheel or push the pedals is just one of many examples of government rule making that leads to nonsensical results.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Mythical Model 2</h3>\n<p>The saga of the so-called “Model 2” [no one knows what the car will actually be called] is a long and torturous tale. In March of last year, <em><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/tesla-model-2-set-production-next-year-sub-%C2%A325k-ev\">Autocar</a></em> — which is not known for idle speculation — wrote that the long awaited, less expensive car from Tesla <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/03/24/lower-priced-tesla-model-production-to-begin-in-2025/\">would go into production</a> in the middle of 2025. Clearly, that didn’t happen.</p>\n<p>That report claimed the new model would first be built in the Tesla factory in Germany, since small, inexpensive cars are quite popular on the Continent but anathema to Americans. Building the cars in Grünheide would save lots of money in shipping costs from Austin, Fremont, or Shanghai.</p>\n<p>Internally, the new model is known as Project Redwood, sources told <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-build-new-electric-vehicles-mid-2025-sources-2024-01-24/\">Reuters</a>.</em> Two sources described the new car as a compact crossover. They said Tesla sent “requests for quotes,” or invitations for bids, to suppliers for the new model in 2023 and forecast weekly production volume of 10,000 vehicles.</p>\n<p><em>Autocar</em> also noted “a prediction by the company that 700 million ‘Model 2’ cars would be sold over the model’s lifetime.” That is an extraordinary number, considering that the Toyota Corolla has sold a paltry 50 million copies over the past 59 years. That is a perfect example of Elon having what my old Irish grandmother would call “delusions of grandeur.”</p>\n<p>Musk biographer <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2023/09/09/elon-musk-biography-reveals-internal-tesla-battle-between-25000-car-robotaxis/\">Walter Isaacson</a> describes in exquisite detail how a group of Tesla engineers lobbied Elon for years to give up his fixation on robotaxis and get on with the business of making a less expensive mass market car. The discussions went on for more than two years before the engineers finally prevailed and the decision was made to get on with making a lower priced Tesla.</p>\n<p>There <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/04/05/musk-no-tesla-model-2-for-you-maybe/\">were reports</a> that the Model 2 would use high-pressure castings for most of its structure. There was even a suggestion that the entire chassis of the car would be made from one high-pressure casting. At one time or another, people said it was going to be manufactured in Germany, in China, in Mexico, or in a new factory in India.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Model 2 Cancelled</h3>\n<p>According to a report by <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-2024-04-05/\">Reuters</a></em> on April 5, 2024, Tesla canceled the “Model 2” and decided to resume its plans to build <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/20/nhtsa-adjusts-autonomous-vehicle-rules-ahead-of-tesla-robotaxi-rollout/\">robotaxis</a>. That decision represented an abandonment of a longstanding goal that Elon Musk has articulated several times in his “secret” master plans — to build affordable electric cars for the masses.</p>\n<p>His first “master plan” in 2006 specifically called for manufacturing luxury models first, then using the profits to finance a “low cost family car.” On his personal antisocial media channel, Musk posted, “<em>Reuters</em> is lying (again),” but did not identify any specific inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>Two sources said they learned of Tesla’s decision to scrap the “Model 2” in a meeting attended by scores of employees, with one of them saying the gathering happened in late February, 2024. “Elon’s directive is to go all in on robotaxi,” they said. A third source confirmed the cancellation and said new plans call for robotaxis to be produced but in much lower volumes than had been projected for the “Model 2.”</p>\n<p>Several company messages reviewed by <em>Reuters</em> included one from an unnamed program manager telling the engineering staff to hold off on telling suppliers “about program cancellation.” A fourth person with knowledge of Tesla’s plans cautioned that Tesla’s product plans could change again based on economic conditions.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Cybercab Debacle</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-346578\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tesla-Cybercab-robotaxi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tesla-Cybercab-robotaxi.jpg 1200w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tesla-Cybercab-robotaxi-400x222.jpg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tesla-Cybercab-robotaxi-800x445.jpg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tesla-Cybercab-robotaxi-768x427.jpg 768w\" width=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>A year ago, Tesla unveiled a concept for a two-seat autonomous car with no steering wheel or pedals called the <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2024/10/12/why-does-elon-musk-continue-to-fall-short-of-our-expectations-the-tesla-cybercab-disappointment/\">Cybercab</a>. Later, during an earnings call, Musk bristled at a question about when investors could expect Tesla to offer a cheaper car that wasn’t intended to be used as a robotaxi, <em>Bloomberg</em> says. “Having a regular $25K model is pointless,” Musk said. “It would be silly. Like, it would be completely at odds with what we believe.”</p>\n<p>Well, that was then, this is now. In May, transportation secretary Sean Duffy, whose claim to fame is being an on-air personality for Faux News, visited with Musk at the Gigafactory in Austin, where Musk mounted a full court press for an amendment to FMVSS rules so he could build the Cybercab in high quantity. His charm offensive fell on deaf ears, however, so Musk switched to his typical strategy of berating people on X.</p>\n<p>After Duffy criticized SpaceX for falling behind in some programs it is working on for the government, Musk called him “Sean Dummy” on X and wrote, “The person responsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ.”</p>\n<p>When <em>Bloomberg</em> asked whether she was concerned about Musk’s behavior, Denholm declined to take the bait. “As a company, we push the boundaries of technology, we push the boundaries of regulation. Regulators normally are looking to the future, but they don’t know what the future is going to be, so working with them is our mode, and we’ve done that for years now.”</p>\n<p>Make of that weasel worded statement what you will. The takeaway around <em>CleanTechnica</em> headquarters today is that Denholm is showing signs of having reached her limit with Elon’s shenanigans and is starting to behave like a real chair of a major corporation. To which we say, “It’s about time, Robyn.”</p>\n<p>If indeed there is to be a new Tesla model in the pipeline that starts at around $25,000, that could be major news for those of us who still believe in the EV revolution. It is actually more hopeful news than hundreds of thousands of humanoid robots or more AI initiatives from Grok that push authoritarian themes. It seems likely the new model will not be a two-seater or have scissor doors like a Lamborghini Countach, but will probably be the first to showcase Tesla’s <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/10/28/teslas-unboxed-manufacturing-process-how-it-works-why/\">new “unboxed” manufacturing process</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Do Your Job!</h3>\n<p>Nothing is ever for certain with Tesla or Elon. Denholm dropped a small bomb into the <em>Bloomberg</em> interview that readers may find interesting. “The original Model Y was not going to have a steering wheel or pedals,” she said. “If we can’t sell something because it needs something, then we’ll work with regulators to work out what we need to do.”</p>\n<p>If Denholm and the board truly are going to start doing their jobs, it raises this interesting question. Why do they need to pay Elon $1 trillion to do what he is supposed to do anyway and what they can do themselves if they put their minds to it? Elon may have awoken a sleeping giant, and we would very much like to hear what our readers think about this latest development in the Tesla saga.</p>\n</div>",
