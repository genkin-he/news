            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A new study examines the carbon footprint benefits of recycling the critical metal in Europe.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scaling battery recycling in Europe will be key to securing a resilient and clean supply of raw materials needed for clean tech in Europe. With significant volumes of scrap and waste batteries becoming available in the coming years, ensuring we have effective capacity in Europe to recover the much needed materials, including nickel, will be vital. How we recycle batteries will be important, ensuring we drive effective, low-carbon processes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What is the environmental footprint of recycling nickel compared to mining and processing, and how can we scale recycling technologies in Europe? T&amp;E addresses these questions in this briefing, building on <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/from-waste-to-value-the-potential-for-battery-recycling-in-europe\">research</a> which showed the potential for battery recycling in Europe.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, the analysis finds that recovering nickel from batteries generally has a lower carbon footprint than mining and refining nickel. For a typical VW ID4 (77 kWh) with an NMC battery, using European recycled nickel can achieve savings of 1200kg CO<sub>2</sub>e compared to most common primary nickel.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-368859\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1184\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling.png\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling.png 1590w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling-400x298.png 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling-800x596.png 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling-768x572.png 768w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Europe-hydrometallurgical-recycling-1536x1144.png 1536w\" width=\"1590\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nevertheless, the recycling route, and other factors such as plant location, can have a huge impact on the overall carbon emissions of the final nickel sulfate produced:</p>\n<ul class=\"theme-white flex flex-col gap-10 p-8 bg-theme-background-alt md:p-12\">\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\">Hydrometallurgical routes in Europe can reduce the carbon intensity of nickel sulfate by 70% when compared to the dominant primary production routes.</li>\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\">Emissions stemming from electricity constitute around 15-20% of emissions for hydrometallurgy routes.Therefore, the location of the battery recycler employing this technology can also result in significant reductions in total emissions.</li>\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\">Compared to China, hydrometallurgical recycling in Europe is estimated to be 21% lower in emissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to Europe’s comparatively cleaner grid, Europe can lead the way in low carbon hydrometallurgical recycling. Given the potential in Europe, and the expected feedstock of waste batteries containing nickel to become available, now is the time to ensure Europe has the needed recycling capacity. Nevertheless, the existing recycling capacity across Europe is 10 times below where it needs to be in 2030, with almost half of Europe’s battery recycling plans at risk.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to scale effective and low-emission recycling in Europe, and develop a truly European Single Recycling market, T&amp;E recommends:</p>\n<ul class=\"theme-white flex flex-col gap-10 p-8 bg-theme-background-alt md:p-12\">\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\"><strong>Mainstream and prioritise circularity across policy areas and funding streams:</strong> Recycling should be considered as any other clean tech.</li>\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\"><strong>Ban or significantly limit waste material shipment outside the EU:</strong> to ensure sufficient feedstock for EU recyclers, including nickel, the CEA must prevent material leakage from end-of-life batteries, black mass and related waste products.</li>\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\"><strong>Simplify intra-EU waste shipment rules</strong> to cut costs and administrative burden by further simplifying the Waste Shipment Regulation.</li>\n<li class=\"flex items-center gap-8 md:items-start\"><strong>Implement circularity targets in the EU Batteries Regulation</strong> and ensure they benefit EU recyclers, with an amendment to introduce a local preference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To find out more, <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/files/2026_02_TE_report_nickel_recycling.pdf\">download the study</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Article from <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/from-mine-to-recovery-the-case-for-nickel-recycling-in-europe\">T&amp;E</a>.</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "EV Sales In Europe Grow As New Car Market Shrinks",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>New car registrations in Europe dropped by nearly 4 percent in January, 2026, as compared to the same month last year. 799,625 new cars were registered across the EU, down from nearly 832,000 in January 2025. That’s the bad news. The good news is that sales of battery electric cars accounted for 19.3 percent of new car sales in Europe last month — up from 14.9 percent in January of 2025.</p>\n<p>José Pontes will be diving much more deeply into the numbers in coming days in our one-of-a-kind European EV sales deep dives. For now, though, we have some of the top-line numbers from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) to play with.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.acea.auto/files/Press_release_car_registrations_January_2026.pdf\">ACEA</a>, “hybrid electric car registrations captured 38.6 percent of the market, making them the preferred choice for consumers in the EU. Meanwhile, the combined market share of petrol and diesel cars fell to 30.1 percent, down from 39.5 percent in January, 2025.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Is An HEV?</h3>\n<p>“Hybrid electric cars” needs some clarification, as the category includes a number of powertrain choices — some true heroes of the EV revolution and some mere poseurs that pretend to be “green” but are not.</p>\n<p>ACEA includes varying degrees of electrification in its “hybrid electric vehicles” classification — full hybrids, mild hybrids, 48 volt hybrids, and even vehicles using a small electric motor for start/stop assistance or turbocharging (and nothing more). For must of us in the EV space, we scoff at such vehicles, even if they are a little bit cleaner than non-hybrids.</p>\n<p>The ACEA report shows that sales of new fully gasoline-powered cars dropped by 28.2 percent, with the decline affecting all major markets. France saw the steepest drop, with registrations falling by 48.9 percent, followed by Germany — down 29.9 percent, Italy — down 25.5 percent, and Spain — down 22.5 percent. The market share for gasoline-powered cars fell to 22 percent from 29.5 percent in the same month last year. The diesel car market continued its downward trend, with registrations declining by 22.3 percent and reaching a market share of just 8.1 percent.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">European BEV Sales</h3>\n<p>Sales of battery electric cars by country are all over the place. In Europe’s four largest new car markets, which are responsible for 60 percent of all new car sales, France saw an increase in battery electric sales of 52.1 percent, while sales in Germany were up 23.8 percent. In Belgium, however, BEV sales were down 11.5 percent and, the Netherlands saw a decline of 35.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Germany remains Europe’s largest market with 42,692 electric car sales, ahead of France with 30,307 BEV sales and the UK at 29,654 BEV sales. Denmark recorded a notable increase of 52.7 percent, with a total of 10,618 electric cars sold in January. The Netherlands, with 7,165 BEV sales, was down from 11,089 the previous year and now lags behind Italy, which recorded BEV sales growth of 40.7 percent with 9,423 cars sold, and even Ireland, where 7,305 new BEVs represented a 48.4 increase over a year ago.</p>\n<p>The highest growth was recorded in Poland, with a 216.1% increase. Although, it should be noted that the numbers in that country are small — 1,121 last January and 3,544 this year. Croatia also saw substantial growth, with registrations doubling from 69 to 138 electric cars. Lithuania experienced growth of 65.2 percent — from 161 to 266 BEV sales. In Finland, BEV sales rose from 1,641 to 2,505 — a 52.7 percent increase.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tesla Sales Decline</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-338158\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022.04-Tesla-Model-Y-Barcelona-spain-eu-europe-urban-CleanTechnica-logo-watermark.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022.04-Tesla-Model-Y-Barcelona-spain-eu-europe-urban-CleanTechnica-logo-watermark.jpg 1200w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022.04-Tesla-Model-Y-Barcelona-spain-eu-europe-urban-CleanTechnica-logo-watermark-400x222.jpg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022.04-Tesla-Model-Y-Barcelona-spain-eu-europe-urban-CleanTechnica-logo-watermark-800x445.jpg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2022.04-Tesla-Model-Y-Barcelona-spain-eu-europe-urban-CleanTechnica-logo-watermark-768x427.jpg 768w\" width=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>In its statistics for manufacturers, ACEA does not differentiate by powertrain type. Tesla stands alone as the only manufacturer offering only battery electric cars for sale in Europe. According to ACEA, Tesla registered 7,187 new cars in the EU in January 2026 — 1.6% fewer than the previous January in which Tesla sold 7,305 cars. As a result, <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/17/teslas-change-in-market-share-in-13-european-countries/\">Tesla’s market share</a> in the overall new car market in Europe in January was just 0.9 percent.</p>\n<p>Rico Luman, senior economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told <em>CNBC</em> by email that January’s performance marks another “very weak” start of the new year for the company. “Tesla’s image has deteriorated in Europe last year and people have much more choice now with the range of new affordable EVs — from BYD, MG, and ZEEKR — entering the market, while Tesla lacks new models,” he added.</p>\n<p>Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving, rather than introducing new vehicles and expanding its range of mass models, is likely a factor too, Luman said. “Another thing in Europe is that large numbers of first generations of Tesla’s are remarketed at the moment (after being leased for 4-6 years), this has driven second hand prices down,” Luman said, adding that there’s an abundance of competitively priced Tesla’s available on the used market.</p>\n<p>Tesla has faced challenges in Europe, including robust competition from Chinese car brands. It’s also struggled to shake off reputational damage from Musk’s rhetoric and close relationship with the Trump administration. Protests erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe last year at the height of Musk’s involvement with the hateful policies foisted off on and from America by the administration.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BYD Shines</h3>\n<p>BYD continued its <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/12/24/byd-rises-in-europe-as-tesla-falls-more-than-tripling-sales/\">rapid growth in Europe</a> at the start of 2026. According to the latest ACEA data, new car registrations for the company rose to 18,242 in January — a 165 percent increase from a year ago. BYD has more than doubled its market share in Europe, hitting 1.9 percent last month, which was up substantially from 0.7 percent in January of last year.</p>\n<p>Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told <em>CNBC</em> one of the main problems for companies such as Tesla is that Chinese automakers like BYD have an insurmountable cost advantage. “The big question now is ‘will this trend continue?’ The answer, unfortunately for European automakers and Tesla, is yes,” Field told <em>CNBC</em> by email.</p>\n<p>“Even looking 5 years out, we don’t believe the cost advantage will be completely breached because of China’s structurally lower labor costs,” he continued. “There is some good news, however, that European automakers and Tesla are learning. The cost gap in terms of battery and auto production is slowly closing, and these firms are introducing more models at lower price points, which should help reduce the hemorrhage in market share.”</p>\n<p>Zachary today has written about <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/26/tesla-situation-in-china-doesnt-look-rosy/\">Tesla sales in China</a>, where the news is also not good.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Hurray For Cars With Plugs!</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of slippage in statistics, of course. Government policies can swing wildly from year to year, leaving manufacturers scrambling to catch up. Non-economic forces — such as the well deserved opprobrium for Elon Musk, who has shown his true colors as a white supremacist and advocate for authoritarian governments — can also have a powerful affect on sales.</p>\n<p>The takeaway from these numbers for January may well be less about how many cars with plugs were sold and more about how sales of conventional cars with gasoline and diesel engines are steadily declining. Nothing makes us happier at <em>CleanTechnica</em> than news of a reduction in demand for fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>If Elon chooses not to press his first mover advantage, that’s on him. But the rest of the world seems slowly but surely to be making the transition to driving on electrons instead of molecules, and that is the best news of all.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Energy Dispensed On Rubicon’s Charging Network In South Africa Up 142% In 2025 To 625MWh",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charging infrastructure has been growing nicely in South Africa. According to Rubicon’s annual report for 2025, by mid-2025, there were over 500 public stations operational in South Africa from all the various charge point operators. This growth helped maintain a favorable EV-to-charger ratio of 1:7, better than the global 1:10 benchmark. The report adds that this growth has primarily been driven by private initiatives. Some examples are Zero Carbon Charge launching off-grid solar-powered stations, including in rural areas like Wolmaransstad, while BYD announced plans for 200-300 megawatt-level chargers by end-2026, with initial rollouts in 2025. Eskom piloted 10 stations at five sites and procured 20 EVs for its fleet, aiming for full electrification by 2040.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.rubicon.tech/\">Rubicon</a> is one of the major players in South Africa’s electric mobility ecosystem</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rubicon’s network is currently composed of 103 public charging stations, and 20 charging stations at the various OEM partner dealerships. Rubicon now has a total installed capacity of 6,648kW (public ones making up 5,632kW, and chargers at car dealerships making up 1,016kW). Rubicon says another 77 (11 DC + 66 AC) stations are to be added by the end of FY2027. Rubicon says its charging network handled 21,606 transactions in 2025, up 159% from 8,338 in 2024. This corresponded to 625MWh of energy dispensed in 2025, up from 258MWh in 2024. This 625MWh of energy dispensed in 2025 is equivalent to 3,125,000km (or 78 times around the globe) of electric travel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rubicon adds that some of the highlights of the year included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launch of credit card payments and installed first 30 terminals</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launch of Fleet Charge Cards and on-boarded first fleet customers</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appointed as Geely charge partner</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appointed as Jameel Motors (Changan/Deepal) charge partner(cards &amp; chargers)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appointed as Stellantis charge partner(cards &amp; chargers)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appointed as Jaguar/Land Rover charge partner</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preferred charge partner to DongFeng(E Auto Motors)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selected as preferred charging provider for Hyprop Properties</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enabled electric travel in and through the Eastern Cape with AIDC project</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some interesting insights on customer charging behavior are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers spent a total of 1,054,986 minutes or 17,583 hours charging on Rubicon’s network.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most charging takes place at DC chargers –19,961 DC sessions vs 1,785 AC sessions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DC charging at malls is the leading preference for EV drivers, followed by DC charging at fuel stations and then DC charging at dealerships.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most popular times of the day to charge are between 10h00 –13h00 (I found this to be an interesting time to be a favorite of many to charge).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Average charge duration was 70.74 minutes.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average energy dispensed per charge session was 21.58kWh.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can tell that range anxiety is still an issue that is on many people’s minds in South Africa from last year’s vehicle sales performance. Plug-in hybrids are the hottest thing in South Africa right now in terms of sales growth. Sales of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) were up 280% in 2025 compared with sales figures from 2024. In total, 738 PHEVs were sold in 2024 and 2,808 PHEVs were sold in 2025 in the passenger vehicle segment in South Africa. The overall new vehicle sales market was up 16%, as 596,818 units were sold in South Africa in 2025. That means PHEVs had a market share of just 0.47%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the past couple of years, plugless traditional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) had been more popular on the South African market, with very little action on the PHEV side of things, but a shift seems to be starting now, with HEV sales down 6% in 2025. 13,552 HEVs were sold in South Africa in 2024, compared with 12,751 HEVs sold in 2025. BEVs, on the other hand, did not have a great year in South Africa. Only 1,018 passenger battery-electric vehicles were sold in South Africa last year, down 17% from 1,231 in </span><a href=\"http://2024.so\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2024.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So it seems more people are going for the “safer option” with the insurance of an ICE engine as backup for driving range, hence PHEV sales are growing faster than BEV sales.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is more plug-in vehicle options are now available in South Africa. 2025 saw the rise of Chinese OEMs, enhancing affordability to a certain extent. Some of the models included models from BYD like the Dolphin Surf (under R400,000), Shark PHEV and Sealion 5, 6, &amp; 7, while Chery introduced the Tiggo7 &amp; 9 PHEV, Omoda C7 and C9SHS PHEV and Jaecoo S7SHS. Stellantis introduced the LeapmotorC10 SUV, the Alfa Romeo Junior, and Jameel Motors introduced the Changan Hunter REEV and Deepal SO7. Geely, BYD’s largest rival, also launched in South Africa in 2025 with the E5 BEV and E5 EM-i (PHEV), while DongFeng entered the market with the Box and 007. The Volvo (XC90) and the BMWiX1 and iX3 also entered the market in 2025. Over 12 sub-R1 million EVs were available by year-end, and six new in 2025, which gives consumers more options in this price range. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2026 promises more models as Toyota confirmed three BEVs for early 2026, while Jetour, Geely, BMW, and Volvo have all confirmed several expansions to their current lineup. New brands such as Denza, iCaur, Lepas Zeekr, Riddara, and Farizon have also been confirmed for launch in 2026 by the mother companies (BYD, Geely, &amp; Chery).  I hope with this news of growing charging infrastructure from the likes of Rubicon and its  peers, more South Africans will make the switch to electric. Ryan Jarret takes BEVs on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBBOcnlZpQg\">exciting road trips across South Africa</a> and showcases that it is now quite easy to go on all the popular cross country routes in electric vehicles</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. More awareness programs are needed to educate consumers and build confidence in the market to help accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in South Africa.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Rubicon</em></p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Biden’s Green New Deal Jacked Up Manufacturing Construction in USA, Trump Killing It",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>There was no doubt about it — the Green New Deal, aka Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was the biggest reshoring legislation in the history of the United States, and the biggest boost to blue collar manufacturing jobs the United States had seen in many decade. I remember EV battery factories and solar factories being announced immediately, as well as more EV production lines, battery mineral mining and refining projects, and a variety of other cleantech projects.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in the following years, US manufacturing construction rose enormously, approximately tripling from 2021 to 2024. This is not an abstract “well, it could be this or it could be that” matter. The Green New Deal, which actually also included the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (which was really not that bipartisan in Congress, even if its elements were among the normal public), was very focused on stimulating a much bigger manufacturing economy for the core energy and tech industries of the 21st century. And these industries responded.</p>\n<p>But who expected that if Biden or another Democrat didn’t remain in office, the next administration would try to tear everything down? Clearly, no one would step in and make such dramatic anti-business moves as killing big cleantech projects, raiding battery factories and throwing the workers there in immigration prisons (even if “just” temporarily), and trying to claw back federal funding that was already approved. No politician would be so blatantly anti-business, taking a sledgehammer to the trust and consistency that any good economy is based on.

            "title": "Tesla Situation in China Doesn’t Look Rosy",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I wrote about a shocking January for Tesla in China. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/12/teslas-sales-in-china-drop-45-year-over-year/\">The company’s sales were down 45% year over year</a>. 45%! There’s no excuse that it was January and January is a slow month — we’re comparing to January 2025! And even January 2025 wasn’t great. Tesla delivered 18,485 vehicles in January 2026, dropping from 33,703 in January 2025, in the world’s biggest EV market.</p>\n<p>There was still the question of whether, for some reason, Tesla had shifted its delivery patterns and would end the quarter strong in China. Well … that’s not looking likely.</p>\n<p>Reporting out of China indicates that customer delivery wait times are historically low. If you order a Tesla today in China, you can receive your vehicle within one to three weeks. Tesla is not sold out for the quarter, not even close. In fact, now buyers are waiting for some super-competitive discounts or bonus offers in order to stimulate sales, since they know Tesla has plenty of capacity and needs to move a lot more units before the end of the quarter.</p>\n<p>Tesla has just extended some incentives to March 31 — ultra-low interest rates for 7-year financing packages and interest-free financing for 5-year financing packages. Yeah, if those make your eyes pop out a bit and trigger thoughts of financial bubbles caused by overextended, overly aggressive financing strategies, you’re in the same boat as me.</p>\n<p>Remember that the Chinese government stepped in and required that no one sell new vehicles below the cost of producing them in order to try to get the EV price war in the country under control. Tesla can’t cut costs much to jack up sales, but I guess it can still offer wild financing packages to try to get reticent, more price-sensitive buyers over the line.</p>\n<p>We’ll see what happens in a little over a month, but you have to really be stubborn to not see bright yellow warning flags for Tesla in China right now. In a market that is ultra-competitive and constantly getting excited about the latest tech and constantly evolving EV offerings, Tesla hasn’t brought anything really new to the market in a long time.</p>\n<p>Maybe Chinese consumers come through with a swarm of last-minute purchases. We’ll see. I think what Tesla bulls are banking on now is simply “Full Self Driving” getting better and getting rolled out in China. This is what all the hope centers around in order to revive sales. But how many are starting to seriously worry about Tesla vehicle demand in the here and now?</p>\n<p>The thing that doesn’t make sense to me is that Tesla could have been working on new models and significant updates at the same time that it’s been working on improving FSD, but Elon Musk decided that just wasn’t worth doing. It’s all about autonomous driving, only about autonomous driving, and that’s the end of the debate. For anyone wanting something else, “<em>No soup for you!</em>” (A <em>Seinfeld</em> reference for those who were lucky enough to enjoy the ’90s.) I also think that Musk and team just decided the Model Y and Model 3 were so popular that they could just rest on their laurels. It seems like Musk thought demand for these models could only go up, and greater model diversity wasn’t needed. Tesla didn’t need to play by normal auto industry rules. Yes, that was true a decade ago, but it’s clearly not true at the moment. But, again, we come back to the main point — it’s all about autonomy. Once the self-driving nut is cracked, nothing else matters. Demand will be infinite. And that should happen in about two weeks.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "AI Search is Rewriting the Cleantech Buyer’s Journey — and Many Brands Aren’t Ready",
            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By Melissa Baldwin</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more than a decade, cleantech marketing has revolved around a steady playbook: rank on Google, drive website traffic, show up at events, and convert clicks to leads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, that playbook must evolve to square with the rapid adoption of AI search. B2B customers are starting their buyer’s journey with AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. They’re asking detailed, conversational questions, comparing vendors, and forming opinions long before they ever click through to a website.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data from HubSpot suggests that as much as 95% of the B2B buyer’s journey now happens inside AI tools. And that shift has profound implications for how cleantech companies are discovered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand how prepared our sector is for this change, my firm partnered with SEO agency Rampiq to study AI visibility across 100 leading cleantech companies. What we found revealed both serious gaps and a major opportunity.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>AI Has Two Brains, and One of Them Doesn’t Remember Your Brand </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Large language models (LLMs) operate with two modes:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memory, based on pre-trained data (the models are trained when a new version comes out, like 3.0 or 4.0)</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live search, where they actively scan the web for current information</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because live search is costlier to run, models prefer the energy and compute-saving memory responses whenever possible. That means if your company isn’t well represented in pre-trained knowledge, AI will guess, and potentially misrepresent you entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially risky for startup cleantech companies that lack a long internet history. When an AI doesn’t get a clear understanding of your brand during training, it may misclassify your business, confuse you with competitors, or fail to mention you at all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t give clear direction to AI through technical direction on the backend of your site (schema, etc.), it may </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ategorize your company in the wrong bucket. That could mean it’s steering the wrong stakeholders to you, judging you by the wrong criteria, or recommending you for the wrong use cases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can’t change what’s already in the current version of an AI model’s memory (e.g., ChatGPT 5.2). But you can influence what it learns the next time it trains the model and how accurately it represents you today when it searches the web.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>What 200 AI Audits Revealed About Cleantech Visibility</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a proprietary tool, we ran 200 AI visibility reports (memory and live) across 100 well-known cleantech brands.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five key takeaways:</span></p>\n<p><b>First, memory is vague and differentiation appears mostly in live search.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When AI relied on memory, company descriptions were often shallow or inaccurate. When live search was utilized, recent media coverage, accurate competitor lists, and specific claims finally surfaced. The takeaway: You need to be super clear on your website about what you do, who you help, and how you help them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Second, there is a major citation gap.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across more than 1,000 citations, we found most mentions came from company-owned channels such as websites or blogs. Far fewer came from earned media or high-authority third-party sites. But this is a missed opportunity, because a  Muck Rack analysis of 1M+ citations across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini found AI overwhelmingly cites non-paid content (94% of links), especially legacy and trade media outlets — suggesting that many cleantech brands are underrepresented where it matters most.</span></p>\n<p><b>Third, avoid the sea of sameness — find ways to stand out.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sixty percent of the companies we analyzed shared overlapping taglines with at least one peer. Phrases like “powering a brighter future” could apply to almost everyone in our space. Use unique language to differentiate what you do; numeric proof points are a great way to do this.</span></p>\n<p><b>Finally, AI values mentions more than backlinks.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional SEO rewards backlinks. AI rewards mentions where your company is being talked about by others. A well placed trade article can influence AI answers more than a perfectly optimized landing page. AI cares less about who links to your site and more about who talks about you, where, and what they say.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>SEO Isn’t Dead, But Visibility Has Changed</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI search doesn’t eliminate SEO, it reshapes it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies are seeing fewer website clicks because the answer is available on top of search results. But, when someone does click through to your website, those clicks are more valuable because that person is further along in their buyer’s journey when they arrive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI also levels the playing field. Smaller, focused companies can surface as “best answers” in AI tools even if they don’t dominate Google rankings as long as their story is well documented by trusted third parties.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>A Practical Framework to Increase AI Visibility: PACT</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make AI visibility actionable, I’ve created a simple framework: </span><b>PACT</b></p>\n<p><b>P – Proof</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earn credibility through PR to generate media coverage, guest articles, and third-party mentions. AI trusts what others say about you more than what you say about yourself.</span></p>\n<p><b>A – Audit</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarterly, ask multiple AI tools to describe your company, products, and competitors. Look for inaccuracies, gaps, or confusion and fix them through content and PR.</span></p>\n<p><b>C – Clarify</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escape the sea of sameness. Use specific, measurable proof points in your tagline and “About” copy. Quantifiable outcomes help both buyers and bots understand why you’re different. Be very clear about who you help and how you help them.</span></p>\n<p><b>T – Tune</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimize the technical backend of your website for AI readability with clear structure, schema markup, and FAQs. You can build your site in a way that makes it easier for chatbots to read, discover, and understand your content.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The Bottom Line</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is a game-changer. Data centers are fueling demand for electricity, creating new market opportunities for companies that produce power. And, AI tools are changing the rules of the game when it comes to business visibility and marketplace dynamics.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brands that win in this next phase won’t abandon SEO, they’ll expand beyond it, aligning PR, content, and technical strategy around how AI actually works. </span></p>\n\n<p><em><b>Melissa Baldwin</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the senior vice president of Tigercomm, a PR and marketing communications agency focused exclusively on the energy and cleantech sector. </span></em></p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>It’s been a while since we did an article on Brazil. <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/06/11/brazil-ev-sales-report-local-ev-production-imminent-as-sales-reach-a-new-record-in-may/\">Last time we checked in was in May 2025</a>, when total EV sales soared to 14,600 units and market share rose to 6.5%. In the next few months, sales grew slightly and market share mostly stayed between 6% and 7%, meaning there wasn’t much to really report on.</p>\n<p>This has been a long-term trend with Brazil. Sales ramped up rapidly in 2023, then stood mostly stagnant (with a slight decline) through 2024. They ramped up again in early 2025, surpassing 5% market share, only to plateau once again in the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>But the tides are changing. The forces of electrification are taking a hold onto Latin America’s largest market, and I expect this market to look different, bolder, and more promising from now on. Let’s look at Brazil’s EV market and find out what’s going on, and what are these driving forces I have such high hopes on.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Market Overview </strong></h2>\n<p>Brazil’s EV sales grew slowly but steadily through the first 11 months of 2025, with a peak in October with over 17,500 units. Then in December all hell broke loose as EVs surpassed 26,000 sales, 77% over December 2024 (which had been a record in itself). January 2026 saw a decline from December, reaching 16,671 EV sales, but January is always a slow month in Brazil’s vehicle market, and this represented a pretty solid 48% increase year on year (YoY).</p>\n\n<p>Brazil’s EV market remains dominated by PHEVs, but BEVs have also grown steadily, representing almost exactly 50% of sales last month. Through 2025, BEVs represented 44% of EV sales, and PHEVs accounted for the other 56%.</p>\n\n<p>Both December and January represented significant YoY increases in EV sales, and both also brought new records to overall EV market share, which now sits just shy of 10%. It’s interesting to note in this graph what I mentioned previously, which is Brazil’s tendency to present a sudden burst of growth (early 2024, early 2025) only to plateau for several months before another sudden burst of growth.</p>\n\n<p>Something quite notable in Brazil is that since the overall market did not grow significantly both in 2025 and in January 2026, we are actually seeing combustion-vehicle sales (ICEV+HEV+MHEV) in <em>decline.</em> Overall vehicle sales in 2025 were merely 55,000 more than in 2024. Meanwhile, EV sales grew by 58,000, pointing to a very slight decline for combustion-based vehicles. 2026 seems to be starting in a similar tone: overall sales fell by around 600 units as EV sales grew by around 5,400, meaning combustion-only cars fell by around 6,000 units. Brazil’s peak-combustion came in the early 2010’s, so we’re way past that by now, and it’s positive to see combustion-only powertrains losing ~4% net sales at the start of this year, pointing to the fact that combustion vehicles will never reach the levels they once did.</p>\n<p>Brand-wise, the market is dominated by BYD, with an impressive 59% market share. Such a primacy is common both in smaller countries and in markets just starting the path to electrification, but Brazil is huge and arguably pretty advanced, making BYD’s sustained lead all the more impressive. Following comes GWM thanks to the success of the Haval H6, and in third place we find the upcoming giant, the company trying to beat BYD at its own game all over the world: Geely. A notable mention goes to General Motors, whose strategy of re-branding Chinese EVs as Chevrolets (specifically the Chevrolet Spark EUV and the Chevrolet Captiva EV) has been reasonably successful in several markets, including this one.</p>\n\n<p>Model-wise, we see once again the absolute domination of BYD, winning gold (BYD Song), silver (BYD Dolphin Mini), and bronze (BYD Dolphin). Below follows the aforementioned Haval H6 PHEV, and in fifth place the Geely <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Geome</span> EX2, making quite the appearance in its first month on the market! A notable mention for the also recently arrived Leapmotor C10, available both in BEV and PHEV versions.</p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A Change in Tide: Local Manufacturing Explodes</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s a trend that the best informed of our readers may already be seeing here. A lot of the most sold EVs in Brazil have something in common: they’re being locally produced (or, at least, locally assembled).</p>\n<p>EV manufacturing in Brazil has ramped up at a, frankly, astonishing speed. A year ago, we were waiting for BYD to start production; today, at least three models are being locally built with ever-increasing national sourcing (Song Pro, Dolphin Mini, King) and three more are either starting local production or will do so in the coming months (Dolphin, King, Yuan Plus), as well as several Denza models later in the year. Aside from BYD, GWM is already producing the Haval H6 in its factory in Iracemápolis in both HEV and PHEV versions, and General Motors is already assembling the Spark EUV from SKD kits and will start to do the same soon with the Captiva EV (with more localized sourcing planned as sales increase). Stellantis is also starting local assembly of the Leapmotor C10 in its Ceará plant from CKD kits, and there are also rumors the Fiat Grande Panda BEV will be locally produced. Geely is poised to start local production of its best-selling <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Geome</span> EX2 and also the SUV EX5 in Renault’s plant in São José dos Pinhais. At last, GAC is planning significant investments in Brazil, which it considers the “Gate to South America.” The brand will start construction on its new plant in late 2026. Though, before that, it may start assembling CKD kits in the HPE plant in Catalao, currently building for Mitsubishi and Suzuki but operating far below capacity.</p>\n<p>There are important names missing here. Both Chery and VW have significant local presence in Brazil, yet neither of them is planning an incursion into the plug-in segment in 2026. Though, both are expanding in the non-plug-in hybrid market. The Japanese, unsurprisingly, are also missing in action despite significant local presence in Brazil, and neither Toyota nor Mitsubishi, Suzuki, or Nissan seem to be in any rush to compete in this growing market.</p>\n<p>Local production is a key component for EV adoption in protected markets, and since Brazil is steadily ramping up tariffs on EVs and even SKD and CKD kits (to eventually reach parity with those of ICEVs), there would be little hope for electric cars in this market without it. But as EV production ramps up, national leadership gains all the more incentive to support the new technologies, and the risk of adverse legislation greatly shrinks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>When I decided to make this report, I was not aware of the speed at which EV production is ramping up in Brazil. I thought this country would take a while to pivot to electrification (because big ships take longer to turn and all that), but now I’m not so sure, and even if predictions are hard for such large markets, I’m hopeful we could see 50% EV share by 2030.</p>\n<p>If anything, I’m extremely surprised that Stellantis is ramping up electrification ahead of Volkswagen Group, something antipodal to their current situation in Europe. My bet would be that VW is waiting for its new platforms to come out of China, and for 2026 will focus on HEV and MHEV powertrains, which are also growing at significant rates. I can’t understand otherwise how a brand that leads electrification in Europe has chosen to stay behind in Brazil. If true (and this is a big if), this could mean VW does not trust its European-made EVs are good enough to fight the Chinese in Brazil despite a level playground there.</p>\n<p>GAC’s comments on Brazil being “the Gate to South America” serve to illustrate how Brazil could underpin the EV transition on the entire continent. All Mercosur markets plus several others are closely linked with this country, and as waivers on EV tariffs inevitably start to be phased out, the Luso-American Giant is likely to become the EV hub for South America.</p>\n<p>I mention this in every Brazil article, but I believe PHEVs will have an outsized role in this country, perhaps more than any other in the world, due to its commitment to biofuel development. I consider ethanol-based PHEVs or EREVs with 150–200 km range a completely viable niche, and just as Brazil has the largest ethanol motorcycle fleet in the world, it could become home to the largest ethanol-hybrid fleet. With longer range PHEVs and EREVs potentially reducing fuel consumption by 80% or 90%, such a scenario does not seem far-fetched at all. This, of course, would be highly dependent on how easy it becomes to install fast-charging stations, and if they rapidly become as widespread as gasoline stations are today — then BEVs may yet prevail… which would be good news, as all that ethanol is probably better invested in making jet fuel.</p>\n<p>At last, I think a very interesting thing to follow here will be the competition between traditional brands and the new Chinese competition. For now, the Chinese are obliterating, but I would expect the likes of VW, Stellantis, and perhaps even Renault to start fighting back in the near future, lest they lose their foothold on the continent. Since Brazil’s market is highly protected and the Chinese will not be able to simply import batteries and components, there’s a level playing field here that can be exploited by traditional brands, so long as they have the means to offer competitive vehicles to Brazilian and South American costumers. Despite not having a presence yet, I have higher hopes for VW than GM, as the latter relies on disconnected Chinese offers (the Spark EUV and the Captiva EV are not even from the same brand), whereas VW is building a comprehensive proprietary platform. Stellantis is betting the house on Leapmotor, but that could prove successful. And the Japanese, unsurprisingly, are missing in action.</p>\n<p>What do our readers think? Is there hope for the likes of GM, VW, or Stellantis in Brazil? What about Toyota or Nissan? And when do you think we will be reporting 50% EV sales in Brazil?</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"cm-entry-summary\">\n\n<strong></strong>\n\n<p>Wayve, a <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/11/18/1st-robotaxis-on-streets-of-uk-can-you-name-the-company/\">UK based autonomous driving company</a>, announced on February 25, 2026, that it has raised $1.2 billion in a Series D investment round, bringing its post-money valuation to $8.6 billion. The funding accelerates the company’s shift from AI research leadership to scaled commercial deployment of its end-to-end AI platform, the announcement said.</p>\n<p>“Microsoft, NVIDIA and Uber participated in the round, reflecting support for Wayve’s embodied AI as a foundational software layer for deploying autonomy at a global scale. Leading global automotive manufacturers Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis also invested, in support of advancing Wayve’s unified AI platform spanning L2+ ‘hands off’ through L3/L4 ‘eyes off’ driving across vehicles, brands and markets.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">BMW &amp; Mercedes News</h3>\n<p>The last bit is interesting. As <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2026/02/25/autonomous-driving-news-tesla-sues-bmw-bails/\">we reported earlier today</a>, Mercedes will no longer offer Level 3 autonomous driving technology on its range-topping S-Class cars. Similarly, BMW announced it also is planning to move forward with the less sophisticated driver assistance package available now on the iX3 for its top-of-the-line 7 Series cars instead of its own Level 3 technology.</p>\n<p>BMW intimated that cost was a major issue in its decision, but over green vegetable curry in the <em>CleanTechnica</em> employees lounge this afternoon, executive editor and exalted grand poohbah Zachary Shahan suggested Mercedes may have simply decided to focus on getting help from NVIDIA to develop a true fully self-driving system to compete with Tesla as quickly as possible and just stick with enhanced Level 2 until that is accomplished.</p>\n<p>“Tesla FSD can go door to door now. These other automakers surely need to find a pathway to doing the same. In-house isn’t getting it done, but pooling resources and aligning with the right companies can make it happen,” he said.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stay In Your Lane!</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nissan-Wayve.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-365268 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"445\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nissan-Wayve.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nissan-Wayve.jpeg 800w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nissan-Wayve-400x223.jpeg 400w, https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nissan-Wayve-768x427.jpeg 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Zachary has a point. Car companies are good at building cars. They are not necessarily good at designing computer systems. At the beginning of the EV revolution, the companies assumed they would manufacture their own batteries the way they produced engine blocks, camshafts, and transmissions. Ten years later, most of them are leaving battery manufacturing to the experts rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Wayve said it “pioneered the application of end-to-end AI to autonomous driving in 2017 and has since industrialized its safety-by-design architecture into a production-ready autonomy platform.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“From 2026, consumers will experience Wayve-powered robotaxis through commercial trials with Uber. From 2027, they will be able to buy passenger vehicles equipped with Wayve’s AI Driver, starting with L2+ “hands-off” capability that allows the vehicle to steer, navigate and respond to traffic under driver supervision.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“Wayve licenses its <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/12/10/nissan-wayve-sign-definitive-agreements-to-deliver-next-generation-driver-assistance-technology/\">AI Driver directly to automakers</a>, providing tools to customize driving models for specific vehicles and brands. The system runs entirely on onboard vehicle computers and embedded sensors, and doesn’t rely on high definition maps or location-specific engineering. By partnering with automakers and mobility platforms rather than vertically integrating, Wayve enables autonomy to scale globally with lower capital intensity.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">“In the past year, Wayve became the first and only AV developer to drive zero-shot in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America and Japan, meaning without city specific fine tuning before deployment. That performance is enabled by Wayve’s foundation model trained on globally diverse data spanning over 70 countries and a wide range of vehicle platforms, creating unmatched data diversity that allows autonomy to generalize to new markets.”</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Zero-Shot</h3>\n<p>“Zero-shot” raised a few eyebrows among the cognoscenti here at <em>CleanTechnica</em>. Most of us didn’t know what the term meant, so we did what our grandmothers always told us to do — we looked it up. The folks at IBM were happy to help us out with this definition: “Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a machine learning scenario in which an AI model is trained to recognize and categorize objects or concepts without having seen any examples of those categories or concepts beforehand.” We learn something new every day!</p>\n<p>Uber has committed an additional $300,000,000 to support multi-year deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis on the Uber network, with plans to scale to more than 10 markets globally. The companies plan to launch their first service in London in 2026, with broader international rollout to follow. Under the partnership, Wayve will deploy its AI Driver in L4-capable vehicles from participating automakers, while Uber will own and operate the fleet, creating a scalable model for autonomous ride-hailing using mass-produced vehicles.</p>\n<p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, “We are very proud to continue to deepen our partnership with Wayve, with plans to deploy together in more than 10 markets around the world. Wayve’s powerful end-to-end approach is purpose-built for scale, safety, and effectiveness, and we’re excited to work with them across multiple OEMs and geographies, which we’ll share more about soon.”</p>\n<p>“End-to-end AI has shifted from a research bet to the industry’s chosen path for scalable autonomy,” Wayve said in a statement. It claims to have spent almost a decade pioneering the technology into a production grade platform that can power any vehicle, anywhere. “As the industry converges on end-to-end AI, Wayve is positioned to lead its global deployment,” it says.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">A Total Addressable Market Approach</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/wayve-fundraise-nvidia-microsoft.html\">CNBC</a></em> reports that Wayve CEO Alex Kendall said in a statement, “We are building for a total addressable market that spans every vehicle that moves. This investment accelerates our path to widespread commercial deployment and positions us to build the autonomy layer that will power any vehicle everywhere.”</p>\n<p>The obvious question is, how will this announcement impact Tesla and its pledge to bring Level 3 or higher vehicles to market as soon as humanly possible? Zachary is of the opinion that if this succeeds and Tesla is unable to be the global leader in autonomous driving, that could have a significant negative impact on Tesla’s market valuation.</p>\n<p>There seems to be little doubt that somebody is going to crack the code for making truly autonomous vehicles — soon. It is probably no coincidence that Toronto’s Lloyd Alter today wrote on his <a href=\"https://lloydalter.substack.com/p/we-may-soon-have-70-million-boomers\">Carbon Upfront blog on Substack</a> about a question raised recently by Addison Del Mastro, who asked, “what exactly are people in a largely car-dependent country supposed to do with themselves as they age out of driving responsibly?”</p>\n<p>According to Alter, there are now 70 million Boomers whose eyesight is failing, whose reflexes are slowing, and who perhaps should no longer be in charge of driving a 2-ton projectile to the Piggly Wiggly for a quart of milk. “It is inevitable,” he says. “Take 70 million aging baby boomers and put them in big SUVs and pickup trucks on North American roads, and you have a whole lot of accidents waiting to happen.”</p>\n<p>Can Wayve address that issue effectively? We are about to find out.</p>\n\n</div>",
