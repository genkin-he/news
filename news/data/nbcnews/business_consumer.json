            "title": "From fast food to beverage giants, brands see rising income inequality among customers",
            "description": "<div>The most common refrain so far this corporate earnings season is  that the U.S. economy is increasingly divided between wealthy consumers and everyone else. While many Americans tighten their belts amid rising costs and a weakening job market, a fortunate few are still spending freely, insulated by a financial cushion of stock market gains and years of rising home values. The split is having an outsize impact on consumer-facing companies, but those effects aren’t being felt evenly across brands. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the “two-tier economy” was a major factor in the fast-food giant’s decision to revive its “Extra Value Meal” combos last month. “Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits,” Kempczinski told CNBC in September. “We needed to step in.” Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, Henrique Braun, said the company continued to see “divergency in spending between the income groups” last quarter. “The pressure on middle- and low-end-income consumers is still there.” The widening K The U.S. economy has been turning more “K”-shaped for decades, with the high-earner cohort doing better and better while others fall further down the economic ladder. In 1989, the top 10% of U.S. wealth holders already controlled about 61% of the total wealth in the economy, according to Federal Reserve data. Today, it’s about 67%. While inequality has grown throughout this period, its rate of growth has ebbed and risen. For example, signs of bifurcation blared louder during the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the stock market began to recover its early losses, huge parts of the economy remained shut down. But these signs receded somewhat in the following years, as government stimulus checks and loan-payment forbearance helped boost the fortunes of lower-income households. Five years on, worrying signals of inequality are roaring back into view. This time, the cracks appear to be hardening. Average worker pay only barely outpaces inflation — which remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. But the pace of that wage growth is higher for salaried workers than for those paid by the hour, according to data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. For nearly all workers, the employment outlook is uncertain, with mass layoffs in the news and AI doing work that people used to do. “While upper-income consumers are doing great and benefiting from the wealth effect of owning their home and having a stock portfolio, anyone renting or who doesn’t own stocks is not,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. “At best, their wages are only keeping up. They’re doing a lot of running in place.” Two kinds of consumers The same K shape that characterizes widening income inequality is reflected in consumer spending. As a result, the volume of companies reporting evidence of a two-tiered economy among their customers surged in recent weeks. Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said the restaurant chain had seen the divide among its customers deepen just in the past few months. “Earlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency [of restaurant visits] across all income” levels, he said on Chipotle’s earnings call Wednesday. “Since then, the gap has widened, with low- to middle-income guests further reducing frequency” of their visits, he said. Younger adults ages 25 to 35 are being particularly hard hit, said Boatwright. “This group is facing several headwinds, including unemployment, increased student loan repayment and slower real wage growth.” It’s not just fast-casual dining that’s feeling the loss of lower-income customers. On Tuesday, the CEO of snack giant Mondelez said the company saw weakness in its cookie and cracker segment last quarter partly due to “value-seeking consumers increasingly turning to discounters and club stores.” Yet a decline in consumers willing to pay for name-brand snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy is only part of the challenge, said chief executive Dirk Van de Put. “Higher-income consumers increasingly are choosing premium and better-for-you products,” he said, a category that excludes many of Mondelez’s biggest sellers. The twin issues, he said, were starting to affect the company’s bottom line. Washington is watching The growing inequality between a small percentage of consumers and everyone else has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he had noticed the surge in consumer-oriented companies reporting split-screen spending patterns. They “are saying there is a bifurcated economy there, and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said Wednesday. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth,” said Powell. “So, we think there is something there.” President Donald Trump’s tariffs are part of the equation, too, Fed governor Christopher Waller told CNBC. Rising prices on a subset of consumer goods hit with tariffs has contributed to a “two-tier” spending scenario where higher-income shoppers had become virtually “price insensitive,” he said. Meanwhile, lower-income customers will simply “walk out the door” if they see higher prices, Waller said. The wealthy keep shopping As lower-income consumers pull back, spending by the top half of the K is increasingly helping to keep the economy humming. The top 10% of earners account for about half of all consumer spending, according to recent estimates from Moody’s Analytics. This month, American Express reported that spending by its typically higher-income card holders accelerated by 8%. The number of newly opened “Platinum Card” accounts doubled,  partly due to a recent “refresh” of the card’s perks. Automakers and airlines have likewise expanded their higher-end offerings — with stellar results. Delta Air Lines now expects sales of premium seats like Comfort-Plus to exceed sales of main cabin seats for the first time, starting next year. “Premium products used to be loss leaders, and now they’re the highest-margin products,” airline President Glen Hauenstein said on the company’s recent earnings call. Likewise, Ford and GM both reported booming sales for their largest and most expensive SUVs. “Today’s auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,” Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, wrote in September. Beyond consumer spending Simply looking at consumer behavior may not capture the full financial picture of American households, said Chris Wheat, managing director at JPMorganChase & Co. and president of the the bank’s research institute. “Just looking at spending, do you really have the full picture of ‘How K-shaped is the K?’” he said. “There are other ways people might be taking advantage of some of the economic growth we’ve been experiencing.” For example, there are signs that more lower-income households are investing in the stock market than a decade ago. As of May 2025, the share of people with below-median incomes transferring funds to investment accounts was about five times higher than the average seen between 2010 and 2015, according to data from the JPMorganChase Institute. Meanwhile, there is evidence that the K may be flattening for the rich. Upper-income households face new financial pressures today in a rapidly changing labor market that’s witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the growth of traditionally higher-paying white-collar jobs. Credit delinquencies among individuals making $150,000 or more have doubled since 2023, according to credit modeler VantageScore. During the same period, delinquencies for people making between $45,000 and $150,000 rose 58%, and just 17% for borrowers earning less than $45,000. The key distinction is annual income versus total wealth, said Rikard Bandebo, VantageScore’s chief economist. Today, the share of jobs being created that are considered high-income has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2015, he said. This suggests that even a well-paying job is no longer a reliable source of financial stability compared with owning assets like stocks and real estate. “We are seeing more people in the U.S. economy struggling to make ends meet — and even seeing people in the higher-income range struggling,” said Bandebo. “It’s not as simple as income being the differentiator here — it’s wealth being more the driver,” he said.</div>",

            "title": "Graphic: Halloween candy’s startling rise in price",
            "description": "<div>Halloween treats are as sweet as ever, but the rising costs of candy may make consumers feel tricked this year. Data shows Halloween candy prices are increasing faster than inflation, a squeeze experts attribute to conditions in the cocoa crop climate and increases in confectionary manufacturing costs. Five years ago, a 100-count bag of assorted Halloween candy would have cost around $9 a bag. Today, this bag would cost around $16, according to research from the personal finance website FinanceBuzz. “The era of cheap chocolate is over,” said Alexis Villacis, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Ohio State University.  Soaring cocoa prices in recent years have changed the equation for many chocolate makers. These prices have reached record highs amid poor harvests in West Africa, where about 70% of the world’s cocoa is grown, Villacis said. Rising temperatures, irregular rainfall and crop diseases linked to climate change have devastated cocoa yields. This created a half-million ton global cocoa deficit, where supply is far below demand, the largest in 60 years.  And because cocoa trees take four to five years to start producing cocoa beans, Villacis said, it will take time before new, more resilient crops can ease prices. While cocoa prices had typically traded between $2,000 to $3,000 per metric ton, prices peaked at more than $10,000 early this year. David Branch, a sector manager at the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, said that the ripple effects are still working through the supply chain. Most of the chocolate sold for Halloween was produced when cocoa was trading at the highest price. “Manufacturers had no choice but to raise prices just to break even,” he said. Hershey’s raised chocolate prices by double digit percentages, according to its July statement, though this price adjustment will not affect Halloween candy. Chocolate manufacturers are also reformulating their recipes, both Branch and Villacis said. Strategies include reducing the amount of cocoa in the chocolate and putting out new flavors that mix in lower-cost ingredients, such as caramel and nuts. Non-chocolate candy has also seen price increases. According to Branch, general manufacturing costs for candy makers, including energy, labor and transportation, have risen 37% since early 2024, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price index data. Among the 73% of Americans who plan to celebrate the holiday this year, nearly all expect to buy candy, according to a survey from the National Retail Foundation, a trade group representing U.S. retailers. Halloween candy sales are projected to make up $3.9 billion of the $13.1 billion spent on Halloween this year. And 79% of shoppers anticipate higher prices specifically because of tariffs. That said, Americans aren’t ready to give up their sweets. “People still want their little pick-me-up,” Branch said. Some shoppers find creative ways to stretch their candy budget. Kiersti Torok, a couponing content creator who has nearly 4 million followers on her Torok Coupon Hunter TikTok account, teaches her audience how to stack coupons and take advantage of promotions. In one recent video, Torok used buy one, get one offers and promo codes at Walgreens to buy 14 bags of Skittles, Starburst, and Nerds — what would cost more than $90 at full price — for $36. “People are feeling it,” Torok told NBC News, referring to price increases. “The Walgreens candy deal I do every year used to be about $1.50 a bag. This year, it ended up being $2.50 a bag.” And she skipped letting her followers know about the chocolate deals altogether. Torok said that even after applying her deals, candies such as Hershey’s, Reese’s, and KitKat cost double the price of last year: “I didn’t share that option because I was like, man, that is really crazy outrageous.” Torok bought most of her Halloween candy months ago, during Valentine’s Day clearance sales, and said she donated extras to a local foster care center’s trunk-or-treat event. Her advice to viewers is her mother’s old saying: “Life by the inch is a cinch, life by the yard is hard. Plan ahead and make small adjustments, and it adds up.”</div>",

Grocery prices have been on the rise for most of the past five years, as supply chain bottlenecks, the war in Ukraine and excessive profit-taking here in America have put a strain on consumers’ wallets.  Trump campaigned heavily on the price of food in 2024, promising that if elected he would lower costs. The average price of eggs — a frequent stand-in for inflation during the campaign — had declined from its peak in the spring and is back to prices last seen last November. Average orange juice prices are up 10%, and ground beef prices up 7% from where those were a year ago. Follow price trends using the chart below. Since 2021, NBC News has monitored the average point-of-sale price for eggs, chicken, bread, ground beef and other common grocery items. The graphic below shows their current average prices, along with how much those prices have changed since October 2024. The grocery price data, provided by the global marketing research firm NIQ, is collected from real checkout prices paid nationwide at grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, selected dollar stores, selected warehouse clubs and military commissaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly consumer price index, which uses human data collectors and includes other food product categories, is another resource for average price data.

It was unclear Tuesday what the terms of the Walmart-AI partnership would be.  The Walmart collaboration is the latest in a flurry of new deals for OpenAI, which has announced long-term partnerships in recent weeks with several of the biggest AI and chip companies.  “We’re excited to partner with Walmart to make everyday purchases a little simpler. It’s just one way AI will help people every day under our work together,” Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, said in a statement.  The partnership could also serve OpenAI by introducing ChatGPT to a massive set of consumers who may not be as accustomed to using AI chats in their shopping as OpenAI’s core user base.  “There is a native AI experience coming that is multi-media, personalized and contextual,” said McMillon. </div>",

            "title": "U.S. consumers bearing more than half the cost of tariffs so far, Goldman Sachs says",
            "description": "<div>Six months into President Donald Trump’s unprecedented gambit to impose sizable tariffs on imports, U.S. consumers are already shouldering as much as 55% of their costs, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs analysts. And with new tariffs likely on the way, the cost burden could rise even higher, they said.  The findings, released Sunday, suggest U.S. consumers will continue to struggle with high prices — something Trump had promised to address in the run-up to his re-election. While inflation rates have come down from the post-Covid peak, they have remained stuck above levels economists consider healthy, causing consumers and businesses alike to continue to report feeling burdened by price increases.     Over the past six months, Trump has imposed tariffs on copper, steel, aluminum, and some automobiles and auto parts. He has also levied country-specific tariff rates of as much as 28% on China and 16% on much of the rest of the world, according to the Yale Budget Lab.   Partially as a result, consumer prices tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have increased every month since April, when Trump made his “Liberation Day” speech announcing the new duties. As of August, the BLS’ benchmark Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 2.93%. September CPI data has been delayed due to the government shutdown, now in its 13th day, and is now slated to be released later this month.  A separate inflation measure preferred by the Federal Reserve has likewise continued to climb, rising to 2.7% for August — above the central bank’s 2% target.   In August, Trump assailed an initial Goldman Sachs estimate that said consumers could bear as much as 67% of the cost of tariffs. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Monday.  The Goldman analysts arrived at their estimate of the tariffs’ burden on consumers by comparing how much consumer prices for tariffed products have deviated from previous trends. The burden is actually less than the estimated pass-through that occurred during the trade war Trump set off during his first term in 2018. In that period, evidence suggests foreign exporters did not bear any significant share of the tariff costs at the time, meaning consumers were shouldering even more of a burden. This time, exporters are bearing some cost, along with U.S. businesses, who may actually be sparing consumers even worse price increases for the moment. American companies may be waiting to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on tariffs, the Goldman analysts said. Businesses also might have accumulated inventory in advance of the tariffs setting in, allowing them to hold off on raising their retail prices more significantly. The nation’s highest court is set to hear opening arguments in the tariff case Nov. 5. Still, the analysts estimate tariffs have added 0.44% to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. That figure could rise to as much as 0.6% if Trump makes good on recent threats to impose tariffs on products such as furniture and kitchen cabinets. Those were set to take effect Tuesday. In this scenario, the tariffs’ cost burden borne by consumers could rise to 70%.  The analysts’ latest estimate does not take into account Trump’s threat Friday to double the tariffs on China. On Monday, Trump administration officials sought to reassure markets that they did not seek to reignite tensions with America’s largest overseas trading partner If those tariffs were to take effect, the impact would be significant, the analysts said.    “We are not assuming any changes to tariff rates on imports from China, but events in recent days suggest large risks,” they wrote.</div>",

            "title": "'KPop Demon Hunters' is a top Halloween costume — and Asian kids are loving the representation",
            "description": "<div>Jean Wang, a Boston-based fashion blogger, was so excited when her daughter said she wanted to dress up as Rumi, the purple-haired protagonist of the Netflix blockbuster “KPop Demon Hunters,” that she decided to go all out with a DIY costume.   Wang and her daughter Nori, 7, said they feel proud that such a popular costume -- “KPop Demon Hunters” looks are already a top pick this year -- is rooted in Asian culture.  “I remember, growing up, the struggle at Halloween to find a costume that felt ‘me,’” Wang said. “It’s definitely refreshing and exciting to see the ‘it’ costume of the year, for people of all backgrounds, being a female Asian character.”  Due to the film’s late summer release, big retailers have scrambled to mass produce Rumi’s purple wig and gold-black jacket and the black hanbok made iconic by demon heartthrob Jinu. For Asian Americans, the runaway success of “KPop Demon Hunters” is another watershed moment for representation in pop culture, parents and experts say, as children no longer have to look primarily to Pixar or Disney princesses for costume inspiration.   But dissatisfied with the costumes she found online, Wang got a cropped jacket from Zara and refashioned it with gold stripes, then bought purple hair extensions and braided them herself — a hair tutorial video she uploaded on Instagram quickly went viral. Nori loved the outfit for the demon-slaying leader of three-member K-pop girl band Huntrix so much she has worn it every weekend, Wang said.  “My daughter is definitely aware that the characters ‘look more like her,’” she said. “But at the end of the day, Rumi is a brave, talented and fierce character who also shows vulnerability in a very relatable way.” Ella Pereyra, 11, says she was lucky enough to take representation to the next level -- she’s the actual model for Spirit Halloween’s Rumi costume.  As a Filipina American girl from New Jersey, Pereyra said she feels proud to see herself on screen and in pop culture. She said she’d already watched the film “KPop Demon Hunters” about “a billion times” when she got the booking call. “I feel very grateful that they made a movie about people that looked like me,” Pereyra said about playing Rumi. “I feel lucky to play Rumi because not a lot of people can do that. Young A Jung, an assistant professor at George Mason University who teaches modern Korean literature and pop culture, said one factor behind the mass appeal of “KPop Demon Hunters” might be the complexity of its central characters, Rumi and Jinu.  “Global teens and youth groups with complex everyday lives might no longer want to see clearcut Western-style heroes,” Jung said, adding that the movie’s exploration of the shame that K-pop idols feel, and their efforts to hide their pasts, is particularly resonant with fans.  “KPop Demon Hunters” also presents a “remarkably realistic portrayal of contemporary South Korean life and landscape” interwoven with Korean folklore and mythology.  “The depiction of shamanism and the grim reaper is very concrete,” she said, “and the everyday life of eating ramen and kimbap is very correct.” The characters and their outfits are themselves rich with symbolism.  Jung pointed out the double meaning of “saja,” which signifies both “lion” and “dead people.” In the movie, Jinu’s black hanbok and gat, a wide-brimmed sheer hat, were historically the formal wear of Confucius scholars, she said. Later, the look became incorporated in folktales as the attire of grim reapers. Even the film’s animal characters, the tiger and magpie, are inspired by Korean folk painting.   Since the movie draws so heavily from Korean traditions, marketing the characters’ outfits simply as trendy Halloween costumes can risk diluting their cultural importance, said Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and culture critic.  “You don’t want these traditional garbs to become associated with ‘demon wear,’” she said. “You don’t want to see traditional clothing be co-opted and diminished by Hollywood.” Some parents say their children were simply enthralled by the bright, pop aesthetic of the movie and too young to understand its layered cultural references.   Jessica Castañeda, 27, began looking for a Rumi costume for her daughter, Kasey, almost as soon as they watched the movie together.  Castañeda said Kasey, 5, quickly introduced her friends to the movie, and soon they all wanted to dress up as Rumi, Zoey, Jinu and Abby. Last month, Castañeda planned a “KPop Demon Hunters” themed birthday party for Kasey that featured Shin Ramyun and soda pops. The soundtrack was what hooked her, Castañeda said: “The songs are catchy, and she wanted Rumi’s hair.” </div>",

            "title": "Consumer outlook for household finances falls to lowest in over a decade: Survey",
            "description": "<div>U.S. consumers have rarely felt worse about their economic futures, according to data released Friday from the University of Michigan's widely followed Surveys of Consumers.  Consumers’ five-year outlooks for their household finances fell to the lowest in over a decade in October, preliminary results of the monthly survey found. With an index reading of 96, it's the worst month since at least July 2011, when the survey resumed asking the question about the five-year outlook.    Overall consumer sentiment was essentially unchanged from September, but was down 22% compared with the reading for October 2024.   “It’s very clear consumers don’t feel like they’re thriving,” said Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director. While consumers indicate that the prospect of a major financial calamity remains low, “they expect to continue to not thrive,” she said.  President Donald Trump’s shifting trade policies and federal spending cuts have helped keep the U.S. economy mired in uncertainty.   Trump was elected to a second term on promises to supercharge economic growth and bring down inflation. During his first few months in office, optimism that he would fulfill these promises buoyed consumer sentiment. But the Trump bump evaporated starting in July, and the outlook measure has declined every month since.  “The headwinds facing households from the weak labor market and drag on real income growth from tariff-induced price increases” suggest the recent pace of consumer spending is “unsustainable,” Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economics analyst at Pantheon Macroeconomics research group, wrote in a note Friday. The October downturn in the five-year outlook reading was driven primarily by middle-income households, whose sentiment fell to near all-time lows. Among all households, concerns about unemployment and inflation remained elevated, the survey found.  Approximately 63% of respondents said they expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year.  Meanwhile, long-run inflation expectations were unchanged, with the pace of price growth expected to hit 3.7% over the next five years. That is well above the Federal Reserve’s official 2% inflation target.  The latest NBC News Grocery Tracker shows inflation for many essentials remains elevated, with prices for ground beef and orange juice having moved sharply higher in recent weeks. Perceptions of whether the federal government is doing a good job of fighting inflation and unemployment hit new lows in October. Among the respondents, 66% said Washington is doing a “poor” job, while just 18% said the effort was “good.”  The latest Michigan survey was conducted between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6.  In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: “Robust real wage, consumer spending, and retail sales growth indicate that the Administration’s efforts to tame Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and get American booming again are paying off. As President Trump’s full suite of economic policies — from rapid deregulation to tax cuts to historic trade deals — continue to take effect, Americans can rest assured that the best is yet to come.” The new Michigan data dovetails with other recent surveys that show ailing consumer health.  The Conference Board found that consumer confidence in September fell to its lowest level since April, when Trump unveiled massive “Liberation Day” tariff increases that shook global markets.  And earlier this week, the New York Federal Reserve’s survey of consumer expectations showed a reduced outlook for earnings growth, greater likelihood of losing one’s job and a higher likelihood of a rise in overall unemployment.  </div>",

            "description": "<div>Thousands of U.S.-bound packages shipped by UPS are trapped at hubs across the country, unable to clear the maze of new customs requirements imposed by the Trump administration. As packages flagged for customs issues pile up in UPS warehouses, the company told NBC News it has begun “disposing of” some shipments. Frustrated UPS customers describe waiting for weeks and trying to make sense of scores of conflicting tracking updates from the world’s largest courier. “I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Matthew Wasserbach, brokerage manager of Express Customs Clearance, said of the UPS backlog. “It’s totally unprecedented.” Wasserbach’s New York City-based shipping services firm helps clients move shipments through customs. He said the company has seen a spike in inquiries for help with UPS customs clearance. More than two dozen people who are waiting for their UPS packages explained the circumstances of their shipments to NBC News. They described shipments of tea, telescopes, luxury glassware, musical instruments and more — some worth tens of thousands of dollars — all in limbo or perhaps gone.  Others have deep sentimental value: notebooks, diplomas and even engagement rings. The frustration has exploded online, with customers sharing horror stories on Reddit of missing skin care products, art and collectibles. They are confused and angry, and they want answers. Packages destroyed?  “It’s almost impossible to get through to anybody to figure out what is happening,” said Ashley Freberg, who said she is missing several boxes she shipped via UPS from England in September.  “Are my packages actually being destroyed or not?” Freberg’s boxes of journals, records and books were shipped on Sept. 18, according to tracking documents she shared with NBC News.  Over the next two weeks, she received two separate notifications from UPS that her personal mementos had not cleared customs and as a result had been “disposed of” by UPS. Then, on Oct. 1, a UPS tracking update appeared for her packages, saying they were on the way. The tracking updates Freberg showed NBC News for that shipment revealed it was the most recent update she had received.  While sentimental value is impossible to measure, other customers fear they will not be able to recover financially if their goods were destroyed. Tea importer Lauren Purvis of Portland, Oregon, said five shipments from Japan, mostly containing matcha green tea and collectively worth more than $127,000, were all sent via UPS over the last few weeks and arrived at UPS’ international package processing hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Purvis has yet to receive any of the shipments, only a flurry of conflicting tracking updates from UPS. A series of notifications for one shipment, which she shared with NBC News, said that the shipment had not cleared customs and that UPS had disposed of it.  But a subsequent tracking update said the shipment had cleared customs and was on the way. “We know how to properly document and pay for our packages,” Purvis said. “There should be zero reason that a properly documented and paid-for package would be set to be disposed of.” At least a half-dozen people described an emotional seesaw they were put through by weeks of contradictory UPS tracking updates about their shipments. The updates, they said, compounded the stress of not knowing what had really happened to their possessions. AJ, a Boston man who asked that NBC News use only his initials to protect his privacy, said he shipped a package from Japan via UPS on Sept. 12 including Japanese language books, a pillow and a backpack.  After it sat in Louisville for nearly two weeks, AJ got a tracking update on Sept. 26, one of several that he shared with NBC News. “We’re sorry, your package did not clear customs and has been removed from the UPS network. Per customs guidelines, it has been destroyed. Please contact the sender for more information,” it read. Three days later, on Sept. 29, he received another, and this one read: “On the Way. Import Scan, Louisville, KY, United States.” For a moment, it appeared as though AJ’s shipment might have been found.  But less than 24 hours after his hopes were raised, another tracking update arrived: “We’re sorry,” it began. It was the same notice that his package had “been destroyed” that he had received on the 26th.  Two minutes later, he got his final update: “Unable to Deliver. Package cannot clear due to customs delay or missing info. Attempt to contact sender made. Package has been disposed of.”  A mess for customs  International shipping was thrown into chaos after the long-standing “de minimis” tariff exemption for low-value packages ended on Aug. 29.  Packages with values of $800 or less, which were previously allowed to enter the United States duty-free, are now subject to a range of tariffs and fees. They include hundreds of country-specific rates, or President Donald Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, as well as new levies on certain products and materials.  The result is that international shipping to the United States today is far more complex and costly than it was even two months ago.  The sweeping changes have caught private individuals and veteran exporters alike in a customs conundrum. It is difficult to know the exact number of the packages that are stuck in UPS customs purgatory. Shipping companies guard their delivery data closely.  UPS reported to investors that in 2023, its international service delivered around 3.2 million packages per day. This week, the company told NBC News that it is clearing more than 90% of the packages it handles through customs on the first day.  The rest of the packages, or less than 10%, require more time to clear customs and need to be held until they do. That could easily mean that thousands of UPS packages every day are not clearing customs on their first try. No easy fix In a statement to NBC News, UPS said it is doing its best to get all packages to their destinations while abiding by the new customs requirements. “Because of changes to U.S. import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,” it said.  UPS said it makes several attempts to get any missing information and clear delayed shipments, contacting shippers three times. “In cases where we cannot obtain the necessary information to clear the package, there are two options,” it said.  “First, the package can be returned to the original shipper at their expense. Second, if the customer does not respond and the package cannot be cleared for delivery, disposing of the shipment is in compliance with U.S. customs regulations. We continue to work to bridge the gap of understanding tied to the new requirements and, as always, remain committed to serving our customers.” NBC News asked UPS precisely what it does with packages when it tells customers their shipments have been unable to clear customs and have been “disposed of.” It would not say.  On Sept. 27, a shipper in Stockholm received a formal notification from UPS that two packages her glassware company sent to the United States — which failed to clear customs — would be destroyed. “We are sorry, but due to these circumstances and the perishable nature of the contents, we are now required to proceed with destruction of the shipment in accordance with regulatory guidelines,” UPS told Anni Cernea in an email she shared with NBC News. The email continued, “There is no need to contact our call center for further information or to attempt to clear this shipment.” Cernea said, “It’s just outrageous that they can dispose of products like this without approval from either the sender or recipient.” From now on, Cernea said, she plans to ship her products via UPS rival FedEx. Trouble ahead Cernea’s decision to switch carriers hints at the worst-case scenario for UPS, which is that people could abandon the company. It is a potential crisis for the roughly $70 billion company.  The company’s stock price is already down more than 30% this year, which analysts attribute to a mix of tariffs, competition and shifting shopping habits. As she awaits her missing journals and diplomas from England, Freberg is looking ahead to the biggest shipping months of the year. “I can’t even imagine how bad the holidays are going to be, because that’s a time where loads of people are shipping stuff overseas,” she said. “If it doesn’t get solved soon, I can only see it becoming an even bigger issue.”</div>",

            "title": "How to get the most out of the early holiday shopping deals",
            "description": "<div>There has rarely been a more confusing time to be a holiday shopper. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration mean many imports are more expensive today than they were just a few months ago. The government shutdown and fresh warning signals in the labor market are contributing to anxiety about the economy. One way to relieve some of the uncertainty ahead of the holidays could be to buy your gifts early this year. And there are plenty of ways to do that as retailers kick off deals season. Amazon Prime’s Big Deal Days, Target’s Circle Week, Best Buy’s Techtober Sale and Walmart Deals are just some of the national shopping events underway in October for the pre-pre-holiday shopper.  “I think the retailers are acknowledging that there is consumer demand to alleviate that stress and anxiety and shop earlier by launching events like Prime Big Deal Days in early October,” said Jack O’Leary, director of e-commerce strategic insights at NielsenIQ.  To get a better sense of how prices are changing week by week, NBC News has teamed up with web data infrastructure firm Bright Data to track the online retail prices of around 600 items across Amazon, Best Buy, Home Depot, Walmart and Target. According to the latest data set, certain sectors are raising prices on more of their items than others.  Shopping for gifts in October could mean significant savings over buying the same things in two months. It’s not all bad news. In a few departments, prices are rising less than you might expect, making these good options for last-minute shopping in December. Chocolate High cocoa prices forced candy makers like Hershey’s to charge more for nearly all of their chocolate this year. In July, the company announced that it would raise prices for retail customers by the “low double digits” percentages.  “The increase we announced in July due to sustained, record high cocoa prices is it,” said a spokesperson for Hershey’s. “Implementation is about 90 days out from the announcement, so you’re likely seeing some of this starting to flow through. As a reminder, this does not impact Halloween seasonal candy.” Hershey’s also told analysts it expects that costs for raw cocoa, which have subsided a bit in recent weeks, will nonetheless remain relatively high into next year. In that environment, special deal days like the ones happening now could be a very good time to stock up on enough chocolate to get through to January.  Clothes  It would be reasonable to assume that apparel prices have soared this year.  After all, the majority of clothes sold at U.S. retailers are manufactured overseas, many in countries that are caught up in a trade war with Washington. But that’s not what the data shows.  NBC News’ tracker has picked up only a modest increase in retail prices since May. At Walmart, for example, less than 5% of the clothes we’re tracking are more expensive today than they were five months ago. If current trends hold, most T-shirts at Walmart won’t cost a lot more in December than they did in October. Toys Few places have been affected more by tariffs than the toy aisle.  Last year, as many as 3 out of every 4 toys sold in the United States were manufactured in China. Since then, President Donald Trump’s tariffs on China have soared as high as 145% at the height of the trade war, before they settled at around 30%.  The CEOs of rival toy giants Mattel and Hasbro both said this spring that their companies were working to diversify global manufacturing so that less than 40% of their toys come from China by the end of the year. But potentially not in time for the 2025 holiday season.  Among the more than 11,000 products for sale on Amazon that Bright Data monitors, prices have increased for 37% of the sample’s Mattel toys, and 41% of its toys from Hasbro.  Spokespeople for Amazon, Mattel and Hasbro didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</div>",

            "description": "<div>Tyson Foods agreed to pay $85 million to settle a lawsuit by consumers who accused the largest U.S. meat company of conspiring with rivals to inflate pork prices by limiting supply in the $20 billion U.S. market. The preliminary class action settlement disclosed on Wednesday is the largest in more than seven years of antitrust litigation by the consumers against pork producers, surpassing Smithfield Foods’ $75 million settlement in 2022. It would boost consumers’ overall recovery to $208 million, including settlements with Brazil’s JBS, Hormel Foods and other defendants. Tyson, based in Springdale, Arkansas, is the last publicly traded company to settle. Its settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge John Tunheim in Minneapolis. Tyson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the consumers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Triumph Foods and data provider Agri Stats remain defendants. Dozens of supermarket chains including Kroger, restaurant chains including McDonald’s, food producers and food distributors have also sued over pork prices. Plaintiffs said the alleged conspiracy ran from 2009 to 2018, and was intended to increase the defendants’ profits, as well as prices. Similar litigation alleging price-fixing of beef, chicken and turkey is pending in Minnesota and Chicago federal courts.</div>",
