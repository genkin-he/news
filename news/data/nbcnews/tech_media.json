            "title": "Tens of thousands of layoffs are being blamed on AI. Experts say there may be more to the story.",
            "description": "<div>Some of the largest companies in America have begun capping or reducing their head counts, blaming the promise of productivity with artificial intelligence for their decisions. Yet, so far, there is uneven evidence that the promised cost-savings from AI are actually worth what companies are putting into it.  This leaves some experts questioning whether AI could be serving as a fig leaf for companies that are laying off employees for old-fashioned reasons, such as financial underperformance or global economic uncertainty. “It’s much easier for a company to say, ‘We are laying workers off because we’re realizing AI-related efficiencies’ than to say ‘We’re laying people off because we’re not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,’” David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in an email to NBC News. “Whether or not AI were the reason, you’d be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI,” wrote Autor, an expert on AI’s impact on workers. This week, Amazon announced it had begun a reorganization that would result in the elimination of 14,000 roles — and said AI was a leading cause.  “The world is changing quickly,” Amazon Senior Vice President Beth Galetti wrote Tuesday. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Yet a few hours later, a different Amazon representative tried to downplay the role that AI played in the layoff decisions. “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of reductions,” said the representative, who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to give her name.  “Last year, we set out to strengthen our culture and teams by reducing layers,” among other measures, she said. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work.”  The representative declined to comment on the apparent mismatch between this second statement about AI and Amazon’s earlier comments. But that disparity — coming from a company as large and disciplined as Amazon — highlights how difficult it can be for the public to verify what companies say about AI and its role in personnel decisions. AI’s elusive returns Amazon joins plenty of other companies in justifying recent job cuts by pointing to AI. Walmart recently signaled that it intends to keep headcount flat over the next several years, largely as a result of AI.  Goldman Sachs announced a fresh round of layoffs this month, saying it planned to reduce human roles that AI could potentially perform. Salesforce recently reduced its workforce by 4,000, citing “the benefits and efficiencies” of AI.  One might think that these companies were all seeing huge benefits from AI, the kind of returns that would make these difficult — and expensive — layoffs worthwhile.  Indeed, the number of companies that report being focused on AI’s return on investment has surged in recent months, according to data from AlphaSense, an AI research firm. So where, exactly, are all these benefits? That’s where it gets tricky. Recent studies have found significant limits on the productivity of AI, at least in its current manifestation.  Out of 1,250 firms surveyed by Boston Consulting Group for a September report, 60% said they had seen “minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment” in AI.  Only 10% of the organizations involved in a similar Deloitte survey  said they were getting “significant return on investment from agentic AI,\" or systems that can make decisions beyond simply following prompts. Nonetheless, more large American companies than ever are using, investing in and measuring the business impact of generative AI, according to a new report from UPenn’s Wharton School and GBK Collective.  But like the other surveys, the Wharton report shows mixed results. “It’s great if you can shave 20 minutes off an email or half an hour reading a report. But that’s not going to leapfrog anything,” said Stefano Puntoni, faculty co-director of Human-AI Research at Wharton and an author of the study. Performance issues?  Many of the same companies that are making layoff announcements while touting AI investments have also been under increased financial pressure.  Amazon’s layoffs announcement comes ahead of its third quarter earnings results, set to be released Thursday.  While analysts expect improvement, there is growing concern about increased competition for Amazon’s AWS cloud platform from AI. After hitting an all-time high in January, shares of Amazon have been largely flat this year and are about 6% below that record. Meanwhile, Salesforce shares are down about 29% from a December 2024 high. Some analysts have questioned whether implementing more AI will be enough to stave off the threat posed by AI to Salesforce’s core product lineup. “No matter what the current state of the company, the narrative is negative and just about impossible to disprove,” wrote Jackson Ader, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital financial group. Some of the companies enacting job cuts are simply looking to rein in spending — including firms at the core of the AI boom.  Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it was cutting 600 roles in its AI unit over concerns that it had become “bloated.”  Rival Microsoft has announced three separate rounds of layoffs this year, and says it is looking to cut costs elsewhere in the company in order to pay for its massive AI investments.  Yet even firms far from Silicon Valley are getting swept up.  UPS said Tuesday it had eliminated 34,000 roles from its operational division, which includes drivers and package handlers — a 70% increase from its previous target. UPS also plans to reduce its reliance on seasonal hires and significantly cut back on vehicle leases.  These changes are “powered by automation,” the company said — corporate shorthand for AI.  UPS is “freeing up our network to grow in the best parts of the market,” a spokesperson said. “AI and robotics help to make jobs safer, while also reducing repetitive tasks.”</div>",

            "title": "A nonprofit on top, billions below: How OpenAI's new structure works",
            "description": "<div>OpenAI announced Tuesday morning that it had completed a tumultuous corporate restructuring effort, simplifying a complex ownership web into a controlling nonprofit entity and a reimagined for-profit subsidiary. The simplified structure will allow investors and corporate partners to more easily reap returns from their investments and pave the way to an envisioned public offering. The for-profit’s board will be appointed solely by the overarching nonprofit entity and will, for now, consist entirely of the nonprofit organization’s board members. In a livestream session announcing the change Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the for-profit entity “will be able to attract the resources we need for [our] gigantic infrastructure buildout to serve the research and product goals that we have.” Altman said OpenAI has committed to spend roughly $1.4 trillion on infrastructure so far, largely devoted to the data centers and high-performance computing chips required to train and power cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems. The umbrella nonprofit organization will be rebranded as the OpenAI Foundation, and the for-profit entity will be called the OpenAI Group. Like competitor Anthropic, the new OpenAI Group will be a for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC), a type of for-profit corporation that intends to produce public benefits and operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, balancing financial returns to shareholders with a broader public interest. A company webpage describing the company’s new structure specifies that the OpenAI Group PBC will advance OpenAI’s “mission and consider the broader interests of all stakeholders, ensuring the company’s mission and commercial success advance together.” Because OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit organization in 2015, it has faced difficulty balancing its nonprofit charitable duties and attracting needed capital. OpenAI launched a for-profit subsidiary in 2019, predicting it would require “on the order of $10 billion” to achieve its goals. However, investors’ returns in the subsidiary were limited to 100 times their investments or less.  OpenAI could not simply now abandon its nonprofit status, according to Luís Calderón Gómez, a professor at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City. To do so, a for-profit OpenAI would have had to buy the nonprofit arm’s assets “for fair market value, something that it was unlikely to be able to do,” given OpenAI’s reported $500 billion valuation in early October.  The nonprofit OpenAI Foundation umbrella organization will receive a 26% stake in the for-profit OpenAI Group, a share that would be worth $130 billion at the early-October valuation. However, Microsoft, one of OpenAI’s early backers and largest investors, will receive a 27% stake. Microsoft has invested $13.75 billion in OpenAI and had been slow to greenlight the restructuring efforts due to concerns over licensing and revenue sharing.  Even though the foundation controls will control less equity in the OpenAI Group than Microsoft, the board of the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation will have “special voting and governance rights” that allow it to appoint all members of the for-profit OpenAI Group’s board of directors. Currently, Microsoft and other investors do not have seats on OpenAI’s boards. OpenAI employees will receive 26% equity in the OpenAI Group. As reported by The Information, a group of investors who participated in OpenAI’s $40 billion fundraising round this year, including Japan’s Softbank, will receive 15% equity, while other investors will receive the remaining 6%.  Tuesday’s announcement stipulated that the OpenAI Foundation will also have the contractual right to receive more equity in the OpenAI Group in 2040 if the group’s valuation reaches an estimated $5 trillion, or 10 times its current value.  Asked for comment on the exact amount of the additional equity, an OpenAI spokesperson wrote in an email: “We can’t provide a specific figure because the stake will scale with performance -- it’s not a fixed percentage but instead is designed to ensure the nonprofit Foundation continues to be the largest long-term beneficiary of the for-profit’s success.” OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit entity by Altman, Elon Musk and nine other co-founders with a mission “to ensure that artificial general intelligence—AI systems that are generally smarter than humans—benefits all of humanity.”  Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a hotly debated concept, with many critics contending that such artificial intelligence is not attainable given current AI techniques, others arguing that AGI is a hopelessly nebulous concept, and other critics asserting that notions of AGI help investors inflate AI company valuations. Yet the concept of AGI is key to OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft. Since their initial partnership in 2019, Microsoft has secured broad rights to license and use intellectual property generated by OpenAI, except for intellectual property related to AGI. Before Tuesday’s announcement, that exclusive access would have been revoked when OpenAI declared it had reached AGI.  The new structure gives Microsoft rights to OpenAI’s IP for its models and products through 2032 and will extend Microsoft’s rights to OpenAI’s research methods through 2030 or until an independent expert panel verifies claims of AGI, if that happens sooner. Some critics are not convinced the agreed-upon resolution is truly in the public’s interest and instead see the announcement as a positive spin on existing plans. In a statement, the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen wrote that with Tuesday’s announcement, the “OpenAI Foundation will function as a corporate foundation, doing some good work but for the underlying purpose of advancing the interests of OpenAI For-Profit. The problem is, that’s not how OpenAI Nonprofit was formed or what it is required to do — the for-profit was (dubiously) created to advance the mission of the nonprofit, not the reverse.” Referring to laws surrounding public benefit corporations, Gómez, the law professor, said: “The statute gives them a lot of breadth on when they decide to follow profit and when they decide to follow their nonprofit mission. I see that as a bit of an empty, unenforceable promise.” Altman initially announced OpenAI’s restructuring would feature a for-profit PBC last December, with a to-be-determined role for the founding nonprofit arm. California’s attorney general inquired about OpenAI’s plans given that “OpenAI, Inc.’s assets are irrevocably dedicated to its charitable purpose.” The proposed transition was fiercely criticized by a coalition of nonprofit groups in April, who saw the move as a violation of OpenAI’s nonprofit duties to steer its assets and proceeds towards public causes. As a result, OpenAI clarified in May that any for-profit entity would “continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.” The Attorneys General of California and Delaware both declared Tuesday that they had no objection to OpenAI’s recapitalization after close engagement with the company. OpenAI’s main corporate entities are based in California and Delaware. In Tuesday’s livestream and a separate statement Tuesday, Altman and other company leaders announced the OpenAI Foundation’s first efforts would feature a $25 billion commitment across two areas: technical solutions to maximize benefits and minimize harms from AI and a focus on disease and health. </div>",

            "title": "Nvidia becomes the first company worth $5 trillion, powered by the AI frenzy",
            "description": "<div>The artificial intelligence giant Nvidia on Wednesday notched yet another historic milestone, becoming the first company to be worth $5 trillion. The value of Nvidia alone is now worth more than the GDP of every country on earth, except for the United States and China, according to World Bank data. Three months ago, the company was worth $4 trillion and a little over two years ago, it was worth $1 trillion.  On Wednesday, shares of the company opened up more than 3%. More than any of its competitors, Nvidia and its record run have become emblematic of an AI investment frenzy that has pushed U.S. stock markets to new highs throughout the year, while making billionaires out of the industry's top shareholders.  The same run has also raised concerns that AI could be vulnerable to a bubble. Some economists have drawn comparisons between the breakneck growth and enthusiasm of the AI boom and the first internet bubble in the late 1990s.  Nvidia's latest stock surge comes a day after CEO Jensen Huang held the company's annual AI conference in Washington, D.C. There, Huang announced a wave of partnerships, investments and deals with companies ranging from the 5G network supplier Nokia to the ride-sharing firm Uber.  Huang also said he expected $500 billion of AI chip orders through next year. Asked about the exploding values of AI companies on Tuesday and if the sector may be in a so-called bubble, Huang told NBC News that \"these companies are generating real revenues\" and the products they are selling are \"profitable.\"  Nvidia’s $5 trillion market cap is also bigger than the combined market values of all of its competitors — AMD, Intel, Broadcom, TSMC, Micron, ASML, Lam Research, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings. The stock has gained more than 50% this year and more than 1,500% over the last five years. In comparison, the S&P 500 has gained only 17% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained just 23%. On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump added more fuel to Nvidia shares, telling reporters that he would be discussing the company's Blackwell chip with China's President Xi Jinping on Wednesday when the two presidents meet.  Blackwell is Nvidia's highest-powered AI chip. Touted by Trump as \"super duper,\" sales of it to China have been restricted over fears that the Chinese could gain an edge over the U.S. with such powerful hardware. The Trump administration has at times sent differing signals about its willingness to limit China's acquisition of advanced AI chips.  \"We don’t sell [China] our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CNBC in July. Selling China America's \"fourth best\" AI technology, however, was  \"cool\" with the administration, he said.</div>",

            "title": "Senators announce bill that would ban AI chatbot companions for minors",
            "description": "<div>Two senators said they are announcing bipartisan legislation on Tuesday to crack down on tech companies that make artificial intelligence chatbot companions available to minors, after complaints from parents who blamed the products for pushing their children into sexual conversations and even suicide. The legislation from Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., follows a congressional hearing last month at which several parents delivered emotional testimonies about their kids’ use of the chatbots and called for more safeguards. “AI chatbots pose a serious threat to our kids,” Hawley said in a statement to NBC News. “More than seventy percent of American children are now using these AI products,” he continued. “Chatbots develop relationships with kids using fake empathy and are encouraging suicide. We in Congress have a moral duty to enact bright-line rules to prevent further harm from this new technology.” The senators are scheduled to speak about the legislation in a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., Mark Warner, D-Va., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., are co-sponsoring the bill. The senators’ bill has several components, according to a summary provided by their offices. It would require AI companies to implement an age-verification process and ban those companies from providing AI companions to minors. It would also mandate that AI companions disclose their nonhuman status and lack of professional credentials for all users at regular intervals. And the bill would create criminal penalties for AI companies that design, develop or make available AI companions that solicit or induce sexually explicit conduct from minors or encourage suicide, according to the summary of the legislation. “In their race to the bottom, AI companies are pushing treacherous chatbots at kids and looking away when their products cause sexual abuse, or coerce them into self-harm or suicide,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “Our legislation imposes strict safeguards against exploitative or manipulative AI, backed by tough enforcement with criminal and civil penalties.” “Big Tech has betrayed any claim that we should trust companies to do the right thing on their own when they consistently put profit first ahead of child safety,” he continued. ChatGPT, Google Gemini, XAI’s Grok and Meta AI all allow kids as young as 13 years old to use their services, according to their terms of service. The newly introduced legislation is likely to be controversial in several respects. Privacy advocates have criticized age-verification mandates as invasive and a barrier to free expression online, while some tech companies have argued that their online services are protected speech under the First Amendment. The legislation comes at a time when AI chatbots are upending parts of the internet. Chatbots apps such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini are among the most-downloaded software on smartphone app stores, while social media giants such as Instagram and X are adding AI chatbot features. But teenagers’ use of AI chatbots has drawn scrutiny including after several suicides, including when the chatbots allegedly provided teenagers with directions. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and Character.AI, which provides character and personality-based chatbots, are both facing wrongful death suits.  Responding to a wrongful death suit filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who died by suicide after consulting with ChatGPT, OpenAI said in a statement that it was “deeply saddened by Mr. Raine’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family,” adding that ChatGPT “includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources.” “While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade,” a spokesperson said. “Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them. Guided by experts and grounded in responsibility to the people who use our tools, we’re working to make ChatGPT more supportive in moments of crisis by making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts, and strengthening protections for teens.” In response to a separate wrongful death suit filed by the family of 13-year-old Juliana Peralta, Character.AI said: “Our hearts go out to the families that have filed these lawsuits, and we were saddened to hear about the passing of Juliana Peralta and offer our deepest sympathies to her family.”  “We care very deeply about the safety of our users,” a spokesperson continued. “We invest tremendous resources in our safety program, and have released and continue to evolve safety features, including self-harm resources and features focused on the safety of our minor users. We also work with external organizations, including experts focused on teenage online safety.” Character.AI argued in a federal lawsuit in Florida that the First Amendment barred liability against media and tech companies arising from allegedly harmful speech, including speech resulting in suicide. In May, the judge in the case declined to dismiss the lawsuit on those grounds but said she would hear the company’s First Amendment argument at a later stage. OpenAI says it is working to make ChatGPT more supportive in moments of crisis, for example by making it easier to reach emergency services, while Character.AI says it has also worked on changes, including a pop-up that directs users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when self-harm comes up in a conversation. Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, was criticized after Reuters reported in August that an internal company policy document permitted AI chatbots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.” Meta removed that policy and has announced new parental controls for teens’ interactions with AI. Hawley announced an investigation of Meta following the Reuters report. If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. You can also call the network, previously known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 800-273-8255, text HOME to 741741 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.</div>",

            "title": "Microsoft, OpenAI reach new deal valuing OpenAI at $500 billion",
            "description": "<div> Microsoft and OpenAI reached a deal to allow the ChatGPT maker to restructure itself into a public benefit corporation, valuing OpenAI at $500 billion and giving it more freedom in its business operations. The deal removes a major constraint on raising capital for OpenAI that has existed since 2019, when it signed a deal with Microsoft that gave the tech giant rights over much of OpenAI‘s work in exchange for costly cloud computing services needed to carry it out. As its ChatGPT service exploded in popularity, those limitations became a notable source of tension between the two companies. Microsoft will still hold a stake of about $135 billion, or 27%, in OpenAI Group PBC, which will be controlled by the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit, the companies said. The Redmond, Washington-based firm has invested $13.8 billion in OpenAI, with Tuesday’s deal implying that Microsoft had generated a return of nearly ten times its investment. Microsoft shares rose 2.5%, sending its market value above $4 trillion again. The deal keeps the two firms intertwined until at least 2032 with a massive cloud computing contract and with Microsoft retaining some rights to OpenAI products and AI models until then even if OpenAI reaches artificial general intelligence (AGI), the point at which AI systems can match a well-educated human adult. With more than 700 million weekly users as of September, ChatGPT has exploded in popularity to become the face of AI for many consumers after OpenAI‘s founding as a nonprofit AI safety group. As the company grew, the Microsoft deal constrained OpenAI‘s ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts as the crush of ChatGPT users and its research into new models caused its computing needs to skyrocket. “OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,” Bret Taylor, the OpenAI Foundation’s board chair, said in a blog post. “The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.” Microsoft’s previous 2019 agreement had many provisions that rested on when OpenAI reached that point, and the new deal requires an independent panel to verify OpenAI‘s claims it has reached AGI. “OpenAI still faces ongoing scrutiny around transparency, data usage, and safety oversight. But overall, this structure should provide a clearer path forward for innovation and accountability,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Gil Luria, head of technology research at the investment firm DA Davidson, said the deal “resolves the longstanding issue of OpenAI being organized as a not-for-profit (organization) and settles the ownership rights of the technology vis-à-vis Microsoft. The new structure should provide more clarity on OpenAI‘s investment path, thus facilitating further fundraising.” Microsoft also said that it has secured a deal with OpenAI where the ChatGPT maker will purchase $250 billion of Azure cloud computing services. In exchange, Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to provide computing services to OpenAI. Microsoft also said that it will not have any rights to hardware produced by OpenAI. In March, OpenAI bought longtime Apple design chief Jony Ive’s startup io Products in a $6.5 billion deal.</div>",

            "description": "<div>Apple on Tuesday became only the third company ever to break through the $4 trillion market value milestone. Apple shares rose fractionally in early trading, just enough to briefly push the company’s value above the historic level. Nvidia and Microsoft previously crossed the $4 trillion threshold in July. Nvidia’s market valuation grown even more since then, hitting $4.71 trillion. Microsoft's value rose above $4 trillion again Tuesday, on separate news that the Windows software maker's stake in a reorganized OpenAI would be worth $135 billion.  Apple has lagged several of its Big Tech peers this year, with fears that its artificial intelligence efforts are coming up short. Apple has gained just 7.3% in 2025, well behind Nvidia’s 45%, Alphabet’s 42% and Meta Platforms’ 30%. For the year, the broad-based S&P 500 has risen 17%.  But Apple’s fortunes have changed in recent months. In early September, a federal judge ruled that Google did not have to divest its Chrome browser business, which benefitted Apple. As part of the ruling, the judge said Google could continue to pay to have its search engine preloaded on devices, such as iPhones. Alphabet currently pays Apple billions of dollars a year to do so. In mid-September, the company released its newest iPhones. The extra-slim iPhone Air, which briefly faced a delay before customers in China could purchase it, eventually was released and sold out in minutes in the country. The negative sentiment regarding Apple among some Wall Street analysts also began turning around in recent weeks.  “Our checks suggest this may be more than the average iPhone refresh cycle, as lead times for the base iPhone 17 continue to outpace last year’s levels,” analysts at Evercore ISI wrote on Monday. “In addition, our survey work points to a strong demand environment.\" Multiple other analysts have also upgraded Apple's stock. To add to the company's good luck, over the course of President Donald Trump's trade war, most Apple products have been exempt from tariffs. Apple CEO Tim Cook has paid Trump multiple visits in the Oval Office, attended a state dinner that King Charles III hosted in Trump's honor this summer. On Tuesday, Cook appeared again with Trump in Japan. Over the last month, Apple has overtaken other major tech companies with a more than 5% gain, well ahead of Amazon’s 3% and close to Nvidia’s 7% jump. Over the last month, Meta’s shares have returned only 1.5%. Apple reports earnings on Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect that the company has even more room to run. As of Tuesday, the Wall Street consensus is for the tech giant to report more than $100 billion in quarterly revenue.</div>",

            "title": "Amazon to lay off 14,000 corporate employees",
            "description": "<div>Amazon said Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, its biggest round of layoffs in years, as it invests more in artificial intelligence. In Amazon’s announcement, top human resources executive Beth Galetti cited AI, which she said is the \"most transformative technology we've seen since the internet.\" She added that AI was \"enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.\" \"We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\" Galetti continued. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent employees at the company an email with the subject line “Some thoughts on Generative AI.”  In it, Jassy signaled that Amazon's workforce would likely shrink in the future. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing and more people doing other types of jobs,\" he wrote. Jassy continued, “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The job cuts at Amazon come amid a wave of layoffs at other tech and retail firms. Target said last week it would cut 1,000 corporate office jobs and close 800 open roles. Meta Platforms, owner of Instagram and Facebook, also cut 600 jobs on Wednesday and Microsoft began eliminating 9,000 jobs in July. Paramount Skydance, which competes with Amazon in streaming and for sports rights, also plans to begin cutting 1,000 workers this week. The total number of cuts could reach up to 2,000, Bloomberg reported. Salesforce reduced its workforce by 4,000 employees in September, citing \"the benefits and efficiencies\" of AI. But AI is not just impacting hiring in the media and technology sectors.  Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told employees in recent weeks that the Wall Street lender would \"constrain headcount growth through the end of the year\" and cut a limited amount of jobs due to efficiencies gained through the use of AI tools. Amazon had 1.55 million employees worldwide at the end of the second quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a filing. About 350,000 of those work in corporate offices, Reuters reported. The tech giant said it would give employees whose roles are eliminated Tuesday “90 days to look for a new role internally,” with recruiters prioritizing internal candidates “to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” Amazon has in recent years also ordered corporate employees back into the office and asked them to move closer to the physical office locations where they are based.  Workers were told in June to relocate to Amazon hubs such as Seattle and the Virginia area, Bloomberg News reported. Those locations are where two of Amazon's regional headquarters are located. Amazon is set to announce its third quarter earnings on Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company, which currently has a market value of more than $2.4 trillion, to report revenue of more than $170 billion. Tuesday's cuts may only be the beginning. Galetti said Amazon expects \"to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains.\" </div>",

            "description": "<div>On a March afternoon in Mason County, Kentucky, Dr. Timothy Grosser and his son Andy sat across the table from three men who came with an offer: $10 million for the 250-acre farm where they’d lived and worked for nearly four decades.  That’s 35 times what Grosser bought his land for in 1988 and significantly more than what others in the area had sold their land for recently. But there was a catch — it wasn’t clear who was funding the offer. One of the men said he represented a “Fortune 100 company” that wanted the property for an industrial development, but he refused to say what kind, which company or even his own name.  Instead, he pulled out a non-disclosure agreement.  Grosser said the contract would prevent him from discussing the project’s details with any third parties in exchange for limited information about its purpose, timeline and size. It didn’t disclose the company’s name, which could be discussed only after the company publicly announced its participation in the project. “We refused to sign it,” Grosser said. “I’m not selling my farm for any amount of money.” Five months after Grosser turned them down, local officials said at a public meeting that Mason County was being scouted as a location for a new data center development. Grosser experienced firsthand what has become a common but controversial aspect of the multibillion-dollar data center boom, fueled by artificial intelligence services. Major tech companies launching the huge projects across the country are asking land sellers and public officials to sign NDAs to limit discussions about details of the projects in exchange for morsels of information and the potential of economic lifelines for their communities. It often leaves neighbors searching for answers about the futures of their communities. The construction of such hyperscale data centers — giant facilities that house servers and computing resources — is booming nationwide. President Donald Trump’s AI action plan and related executive orders have recently facilitated their speedy approval, in part by loosening environmental regulations from clean air and water laws. Hundreds of projects were announced last year, touted by developers and many local officials as economic boosts to local economies.  Those in the data center industry argue the NDAs serve a particular purpose: ensuring that their competitors aren’t able to access information about their strategies and planned projects before they’re announced. And NDAs are common in many types of economic development deals aside from data centers. But as the facilities have spread into suburbs and farmland, they’ve drawn pushback from dozens of communities concerned by how they could upend daily life. Data centers often draw enormous amounts of water and electricity, causing residents to complain about rising power bills and water shortages. In Virginia’s Loudoun County, the world’s densest hub of data centers, locals have complained of a “constant whir” from cooling fans and backup generators. And in Tennessee’s South Memphis, the methane gas turbines that power an xAI data center give off air pollutants contributing to smog and formaldehyde. xAI has vowed to stay below pollutant limits in the area. The confidentiality behind some of the projects has only added to the level of concern from some residents.  An NBC News review of over 30 data center proposals across 14 states found that in a majority of cases, local officials signed NDAs and worked with what appeared to be shell companies that can conceal visibility into the project developers. Five elected officials in different counties said the agreements barred them from sharing information with their constituents.  “That violates a very fundamental norm of democracy, which is that they are answerable first to the voters and to their constituents, not to some secret corporation that they’re cutting deals with in the back room,” said Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit organization focused on economic equality.  Amazon, Microsoft, xAI, Google, Meta and Vantage Data Centers — six of the largest tech companies racing to build data centers across the country — all declined to or didn’t respond to questions about the use of NDAs in data center projects. An information vacuum In Mason County, 20 residents, including Grosser, were offered deals to sell their land — thousands of acres in total — for significantly above market value, according to Tyler McHugh, director of the county’s industrial development authority, which is administering the deals. Eighteen of them signed property purchase contracts with the unknown company, agreeing to sell if the project proceeds.  The Huddleston family, whose relatives have lived on the same property for more than 150 years, said they signed a property purchase contract with the county’s industrial development authority for $60,000 per acre. When they learned from their neighbors that the land would be used for a data center, they asked McHugh for a legal release to absolve them of the contract and the confidentiality clause associated with it. “The neighbors didn’t want to be sold out, and my mom and I agree with them,” Delsia Huddleston Bare said. “If it’s artificial intelligence, I don’t want it anywhere near me at all.”Huddleston said she was concerned about noise, pollution and groundwater contamination that could come with the project.  McHugh said he wishes he could be more transparent about what’s happening but worries controversy could scare away opportunity.  “If I could go get on a megaphone downtown and say everything I know about this project, I would,” McHugh said. “You know what’s going to happen if I do that? Then everybody in the county is going to put it on Facebook, they’re going to put it out there, and then it just becomes a huge mess. Companies don’t want to deal with that.”  But dozens of residents say the lack of transparency is unacceptable. “We are Mason County, KY” — a 1,500-member Facebook group — said it has collected more than 500 signatures from locals in the county of 16,900 people who believe the project poses a threat to their quality of life because of its potential to pollute the area with noise and contaminants. McHugh said the developer hopes to amend the county’s zoning laws to make way for the project.  “It’s just destroying trust in the government,” said Max Moran, the resident who started the Facebook group. “People just feel let down and kind of betrayed, because if you can’t ask what’s going on, then how can you trust anything they say?” McHugh revealed in a budgetary meeting that Mason County was part of a “global selection process” and that the project would include single-story data center buildings and office space.  That has fueled frustration for residents, including Jennifer Setty-Botkin, who lives across the road from a landowner who agreed to sell his property for the project. She filed a public records request for impact studies, contracts and meeting minutes related to it.  Her request and a request from NBC News were rejected, appealed and ultimately denied. Kentucky’s public records act exempts from disclosure records that “pertain to a prospective location of a business or industry where no previous public disclosure” documenting the business’s interest in the location has been made.  Eric Bonds, a sociology and anthropology professor at the University of Mary Washington, said that’s the whole point. Bonds led a research study that found 25 of 31 localities in Virginia with proposed or existing data centers have NDAs in place.  “They can pose quality-of-life kinds of impacts for neighbors who live next door, and when the public isn’t fully informed, that can inhibit debate,” Bonds said. Secrecy can backfire Local battles over data center development are playing out across the United States.  In Saint Charles, Missouri, secrecy fueled a grassroots revolt. Thousands of residents led a movement to strike down “Project Cumulus,” a 440-acre data center proposal. The larger tech company backing the project remained undeclared, having used NDAs and registered the proposal through a smaller company, Spark Innovations LLC, which locals believed was a shell company. Saint Charles Mayor Dan Borgmeyer, bound by an NDA, said that he pleaded with developers for months to let him share details but that they refused, citing concerns about competition. The backers of Project Cumulus eventually withdrew. In August, Saint Charles became the first city in the country to enact a yearlong ban on data center construction.  Similar bans have been approved and proposed in dozens of counties and townships across the country, including St. Louis, Oldham County in Kentucky and Jerome Township in Ohio. In Arizona, the secrecy of data center developers backfired.  Pima County officials were bound by an NDA over “Project Blue,” a $3.6 billion proposal put forth byAmazon Web Services, according to a one-page county memo NBC News obtained through a public records request. The project, which would have been built just outside Tucson, was revealed through a leak to the local outlet Arizona Luminaria. Dr. Matt Heinz, a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors, said he didn’t even realize he was covered by the agreement until,he said, a developer’s spokesperson called to accuse him of violating it by having spoken to a local newspaper. “I just have a lot of trouble with the general idea that I, as an elected official representing 200,000-plus people in Pima County, can be held to the parameters of a non-disclosure agreement with a for-profit, private entity,” Heinz said. “That seems like there could be just a natural conflict with what I have to do in service to my constituents.” Because Pima County officials were bound by the NDA, Tucson city leaders, whose city utilities would have been responsible for supplying the water and power, said they were left in the dark until late in the process. “The lack of community engagement from the jump led to a lot of distrust,” City Council member Nikki Lee said. “I’ve never seen Tucson as united in opposition to one thing as they were to this project.” In response to the proposal and the lack of information, residents built their own dashboard to try to quantify Project Blue’s data and water consumption. “We calculated that Project Blue would use more energy than every home in Tucson combined,” said Ed Hendel, whose company Sky Island AI created the dashboard. After public outcry, the Tucson City Council struck down the project. The Pima County Board of Supervisors also voted to dissolve NDAs 90 days before any county body vote. Keeping quiet to stay competitive The data center industry is a fast-moving and fiercely competitive space, where companies view secrecy as essential to protect trade secrets and stay ahead of rivals. Some local officials, caught between company demands and public accountability, said they felt pressured to sign NDAs to keep their communities in the running. Mason County Attorney John Estill, who signed an NDA for the project proposal, said the county’s leadership would rather not be bound by an NDA but maintained that it’s the only way for elected officials to stay informed about the company’s plans.     “Either you want your government to be courting businesses and looking for development in your communities or you don’t. And if you want them to be courting businesses and looking for growth in your local economies, then unfortunately, NDAs are part of the landscape,” Estill said. But many residents don’t see it that way.   “We don’t have to give up our way of life and bow down to the data center in order to attract other business and industry,” Mason County Schools Superintendent Rick Ross said. “Saying we must cede hundreds of acres of farmland without regard for those who will be stuck looking at and hearing this thing is just a weak scare tactic.“ According to records obtained by NBC News, data center NDAs can extend years beyond the initial proposal dates. Many of them also include clauses requiring local jurisdictions to limit disclosure of records as much as legally possible under Freedom of Information Act laws and notify the companies first so they have a “reasonable opportunity to prevent disclosure.” Bonds believes the statistics from his study in Virginia, which found that 80% of the 31 data center deals in the state had used NDAs, are most likely a low estimate of the number of confidentiality agreements used in the state’s data center projects.  “There are potential definitions that might be used to avoid disclosure of the NDA,” he said, such as those that wouldn’t categorize them as public records that need to be kept on file or disclosed via public records requests. That kind of secrecy can leave residents in the dark until data centers are already deep into the approval process. In Minnesota, the group Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy sued the towns of Hermantown, Farmington, North Mankato and Rosemount, where, it says, developers used NDAs to hide project details from the public, arguing that state environmental laws require a more rigorous review process.  “In Farmington, they were six months into the planning process before residents even knew it was a data center,” said Kathryn Hoffman, the group’s CEO. “This is obviously a troubling trend.” Even when cities produce environmental review documents, Hoffman said, they often avoid using the words “data center” altogether. Instead, they can run the projects through a process designed for smaller developments, like a strip mall or an office park, she said, referring to emails the group obtained through public records requests. Those reviews give wide-ranging estimates but rarely analyze what such impacts would mean for local aquifers, power bills or infrastructure. What’s next for Mason County? Mason County officials say the proposed data center could be an economic lifeline. According to the county’s most recent comprehensive plan, its population and workforce have declined over the past five years. Total jobs are down more than 5% since 2018.  McHugh said the data center could reverse that trend by bringing roughly 400 high-paying jobs to the region. “This is not the time for Mason County to be overly picky or critical about anyone who’s showing interest in coming to our area,” McHugh said. But many residents question whose interests are being served by the confidentiality surrounding the project. “They could have come in and said we have a prime location and we have the resources for a data center,” said Janet Garrison, who lives two farms away from the scouted site. “Why don’t we get together and have a big community discussion about the pros and cons?” Kentucky residents are already feeling squeezed. This month, two of the state’s major power companies have requested rate hikes that aren’t explicitly related to the data center proposals. Customers could pay up to an additional $9 every month if they are approved. Records from the East Kentucky Power Cooperative from July reveal that a new customer is requesting transmission upgrades so the area can accommodate a “2.2 gigawatt data center load” by 2031.  Jennifer Setty-Botkin, another homeowner in the area, shares that frustration. She moved to Mason County for its rolling hills, farms and open spaces, and she worries the project could upend the quiet lifestyle that drew her there. “We love the community, but if this goes through and we have constant 24/7 noise and other issues like power surges, we’re going to want to move,” she said. “But then the problem is: who’s going to buy our house if we’re having those issues?” Grosser knows the developers don’t need his land to build the project. McHugh confirmed that they can easily construct around him. But that doesn’t ease his anxiety about what could follow: higher electric bills, declining land values and pollution. “It’ll knock out the woods I’m sitting right next to,” Grosser said from his porch, speaking over the hum of crickets. “I’ve got too many memories, too much sweat and blood there.”</div>",

            "title": "Elon Musk launches Grokipedia as an alternative to 'woke' Wikipedia ",
            "description": "<div>Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Monday launched an online encyclopedia, named Grokipedia, that he said was fueled by artificial intelligence and designed to be closer to his conservative political views than the leading alternative, Wikipedia. Musk announced last month that he was working on a Wikipedia rival after a suggestion from David Sacks, a friend and fellow tech investor who is the Trump administration’s AI and crypto czar. Musk has described the project in political terms, attacking Wikipedia as “woke” and criticizing it for citing news outlets such as The New York Times and NPR as sources in many of its articles. Musk said on X that an AI-generated encyclopedia would be “super important for civilization” and a necessary step toward “understanding the Universe.” Grokipedia’s operation differs from Wikipedia in at least one major respect: no clear human authors. While volunteers write and edit Wikipedia, often anonymously, Grokipedia says that its articles were “fact-checked” by Grok, the AI chatbot from Musk’s startup xAI. Visitors to Grokipedia cannot make edits, though they can suggest edits via a pop-up form for reporting wrong information. At least initially, some Grokipedia entries say they are based on Wikipedia itself. “The content is adapted from Wikipedia, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License,” a disclaimer says on the bottom of some, but not all, entries, including the one for the Nobel Prize in physics. Some Grokipedia entries, such as the one for Monday, appear to be word-for-word the same as the corresponding Wikipedia entries. Musk, though, has said that he wants Grok to stop using Wikipedia pages as sources by the end of the year. There are some content differences between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Grokipedia’s entry for President Donald Trump, for example, includes no mention of Trump accepting a luxury megajet from Qatar or his promotion of a Trump-themed cryptocurrency token, or meme coin, while Wikipedia’s entry for Trump includes a section dedicated to conflicts of interests — including both the jet and the meme coin. The Grokipedia entry for Musk includes no mention of his hand gesture at a rally in January that was viewed by many historians and politicians as a Nazi salute, while the Wikipedia entry for him has several paragraphs on the subject. The Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts Wikipedia, said Monday that it was in the process of understanding how Grokipedia works. “Wikipedia’s knowledge is — and always will be — human,” the foundation said in a statement. “Through open collaboration and consensus, people from all backgrounds build a neutral, living record of human understanding — one that reflects our diversity and collective curiosity. This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist.” The statement continued: “Many experiments to create alternative versions of Wikipedia have happened before; it doesn’t interfere with our work or mission.” The Grokipedia project pits the world’s wealthiest person, Musk, against one of the internet’s most-visited websites, Wikipedia. Wikipedia ranks No. 9 worldwide in visits, according to data firm Similarweb, dwarfing older rivals such as Encyclopedia Britannica. Wikipedia also represents an earlier, democratic vision for the open web, before giant tech platforms came to dominate and segment the internet. Founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Wikipedia has remained a nonprofit with free content fueled mainly by enthusiasts. It's also ad-free.  Sanger, though, has for years been a critic of how Wikipedia operates, in particular its use of anonymous editors and what he views as a left-wing slant. Last month, he repeated his criticisms in an interview with online conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson, which Sacks then shared on X. Sacks and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wikipedia says it has 7.1 million articles in English, while Grokipedia says it has 885,000 articles initially available. Grokipedia is labeled, though, as version 0.1, indicating many more updates to come.</div>",

            "title": "'Slap in the face': White House irked by a new $100M pro-AI super PAC",
            "description": "<div>WASHINGTON — The White House is threatening some of Silicon Valley’s richest and most powerful players over their efforts to spearhead a $100 million midterm strategy to back candidates of both parties who support a national framework for artificial intelligence regulations.  In August, the group of donors launched a super PAC called Leading the Future. It did not consult with the White House before doing so, according to a White House official. What is especially frustrating to White House officials is that it plans to back AI-friendly candidates from both political parties — which could potentially help Democrats win back control of Congress — and one of the leaders of the new super PAC is a former top staffer to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.  “Any group run by Schumer acolytes will not have the blessing of the president or his team,” a White House official familiar with Trump's thinking on the matter told NBC News. “Any donors or supporters of this group should think twice about getting on the wrong side of Trump world.” “We are carefully monitoring who is involved,” the person added. Some of the initial Leading the Future donors apparently now under the White House's watchful eye include private equity giant Andreesseen Horowitz, whose billionaire co-founder, Marc Andreesseen, is a close Trump adviser; Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI; Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir and a vocal Trump supporter; and Ron Conway, founder of SV Angel and a 2024 supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. None returned a request from NBC News seeking comment either directly or through their companies.  Because it only recently launched, the group has not yet had to file campaign finance reports, making it unclear how much each initial donor is giving to the effort. One of the group’s top officials is Josh Vlasto, Schumer’s former press secretary, who during the 2024 election cycle helped advise Fairshake, a tech-led $130 million effort to elect candidates who support cryptocurrency. The AI-focused political effort is modeled after that 2024 effort. Vlasto did not return a request seeking comment. The group’s other top official is Zac Moffatt, founder and CEO of Republican consulting firm Targeted Victory. He also did not return a request seeking comment.  When the group launched in August, it made clear that it planned a bipartisan effort with the only underlying goal of politically backing candidates who support uniform federal AI regulations, rather than state-by-state sets of laws.  “With more than $100 million in initial funding already committed, LTF is the first comprehensive, bipartisan effort by the AI industry to organize political support and elect pro-innovation candidates at scale,” read a news release announcing the Leading the Future super PAC. There have been fights over whether or not to ban states from implementing their own AI regulations, which recently played out as Congress was debating the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. The bill, which was a priority for Trump, initially included a 10-year ban on states passing their own AI regulations, but that controversial provision was stripped before final passage. Democrats need to flip just three Republican seats to take over the majority in the U.S. House, which would give them significantly more power to slow Trump’s agenda and investigate both the president and his allies. “AI has no better ally than President Trump, so it’s inexplicable why any company would put money into the midterms behind a Schumer-operative who is working against President Trump to elect Democrats,” said a second person familiar with the White House’s thinking. “It’s a slap in the face, and the White House has definitely taken notice.” Since taking office in January, Trump has taken several actions supported by the industry, including in July releasing his AI action plan and signing three executive orders that, among other things, created a new AI export program, prevented use of “woke AI” in the federal government and fast-tracked the expansion of data centers, a major priority for the industry. Data centers are needed to run artificial intelligence programs, but require huge amounts of energy, which has led to increased utility bills and morphing the fight into an increasingly contentious political issue. The Trump-friendly AI policies do come against the backdrop of some groups concerned that AI technology is developing too quickly. Earlier this week, AI researchers, former military leaders and other public figures, including Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, and former Trump administration official Steve Bannon, signed a statement raising concern about computer superintelligence, a not-yet-reached stage of AI they believed could pose an existential threat to humans. The statement called for a “prohibition on the development of superintelligence” until there is scientific consensus and “strong public buy-in.”</div>",
