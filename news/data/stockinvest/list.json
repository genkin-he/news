            "description": "<div class=\"digest-article-content\">\n<p>Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/QSR\">QSR</a>) delivered a stronger-than-expected quarterly performance with earnings and revenue surpassing Wall Street's forecasts. The company's international operations, along with Tim Hortons' steady growth, were the main drivers behind the upbeat results, highlighting some clear winners within its diverse portfolio.</p><p>CEO Josh Kobza highlighted that the combined earnings from the international segment and Tim Hortons constitute about 70% of the overall profits. Despite economic headwinds impacting low- and middle-income diners nationwide, the firm avoided joining the \"value wars,\" focusing instead on strategic initiatives that have kept same-store sales steady, particularly at Burger King's U.S. outlets.</p><p>The latest figures show adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.03, outpacing the $1 anticipated by analysts. Revenue also beat estimates, reaching $2.45 billion versus the $2.4 billion consensus. Net income rose to $315 million, or 96 cents per share, marking a solid increase from last year's 79 cents per share.</p><p>Same-store sales across the portfolio climbed 4% overall, with the international segment shining brightest at 6.5%. Markets such as Western Europe, China, and Japan helped push this number beyond the expected 4.4% growth, demonstrating the benefits of Restaurant Brands' global footprint.</p><p>Tim Hortons pulled in a 4.2% increase in same-store sales, a nod to its ramped-up focus on food offerings and a revamped iced latte that has boosted cold beverage sales by 10%. Meanwhile, Burger King showed revitalized momentum in the U.S. with a 3.1% sales uptick, thanks to restaurant remodels and a marketing push around flagship items like the Whopper. Burger King U.S. President Tom Curtis mentioned plans to elevate product quality, challenging the trend of shrinkflation and price cutting prevalent across the industry.</p><p>Not all brands in the group fared equally well. Popeyes experienced a 2.4% decline in same-store sales, flagging its ongoing difficulty keeping pace amid competitive pressures. The brand is shifting focus back to operational consistency and reinforcing its core menu, moving away from a recent emphasis on new product innovations like bone-in chicken wings.</p><p>The mixed performance across Restaurant Brands' segments illustrates the complexity of managing fast-food chains in today's market conditions. While international markets and Tim Hortons continue to gain traction, Popeyes' slump raises questions on how the brand will adjust to the evolving competitive landscape.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Alphabet Rockets Higher on Strong Q3 Earnings and AI Momentum: Wall Street Raised Price Targets",
            "description": "<div class=\"digest-article-content\">\n<p>Alphabet (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/GOOGL\">GOOGL</a>) shares jumped over 8% in premarket trading following a third-quarter earnings report that blew past analyst expectations. The tech titan posted an adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, significantly higher than the consensus forecast of $2.33. Revenue also came in robust at $102.35 billion, comfortably beating estimates near $99.9 billion.</p><p>At the heart of Alphabet's strong quarter was a booming cloud segment, with sales jumping 35% year-over-year to $15.15 billion. The company credited surging demand for its artificial intelligence capabilities as a major driver of this growth, highlighted by innovative AI solutions permeating both search and enterprise computing. Capital expenditure guidance was raised, which didn't spook investors - quite the opposite.</p><p>Wall Street's reaction was swift and upbeat. Goldman Sachs upgraded their price target from $288 to $330, suggesting a 20% upside from Wednesday's close. They pointed to Alphabet's steady climb through various AI challenges and highlighted management's bullish tone regarding consumer and enterprise adoption of its AI products, including cutting-edge developments like Gemini and AI Mode.</p><p>Barclays followed suit, raising its forecast to $315 from $250, buoyed by AI tailwinds and a stable digital advertising climate. Their take: if Alphabet navigates the intensifying AI search competition expected next year, shares could continue higher. Morgan Stanley also chimed in with an overweight rating and a $330 price target, eyeing upcoming catalysts such as the Gemini 3 and Llama launches as key narratives to watch.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bank of America's analyst lifted their outlook to $335, emphasizing Alphabet's command of large language models (LLMs), proprietary TPU technology, and massive user base. They also noted emerging bets like Waymo and quantum computing as long-term wild cards that haven't yet factored into the valuation, which stands at about 24 times 2027 earnings - a premium roughly in line with Alphabet's history.</p><p>JPMorgan painted an optimistic picture with a $340 target, stressing a shift in investor sentiment. The feared disruption from AI search is, according to them, increasingly seen as an opportunity instead of a threat. That reframing makes Alphabet a top stock pick, second only to Amazon in their ranking.</p><p>UBS remained cautious, holding a neutral rating and setting a $306 price target. Their main concern stems from AI competitors like ChatGPT ramping up their browser and merchant integration capabilities next year, which could chip away at Alphabet's dominance. Despite this, UBS acknowledged Alphabet's strong performance across Search, YouTube, and Cloud, including a sizable $155 billion cloud backlog, which suggests substantial revenue growth over the next two years.</p><p>Deutsche Bank took note of the stock's prior 43% rally since Q2 but still found room to praise the latest quarter as \"virtually flawless,\" with growth across all major segments surpassing estimates by roughly 2.5%. Their buy rating and $340 price target reflect sustained confidence in Alphabet's multi-segment momentum driven by AI integration.</p><p>This consensus of raised price targets and positive commentary marks a sharp contrast with the caution many expressed just months ago. The only sticking point lies in the intensifying competition in AI-powered search, which could challenge Alphabet's near-term dominance. How the company manages that battle will be something to keep an eye on in upcoming quarters.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Oil Prices Dip After Fed Rate Cut and Trump-Xi Talks, Eyes on OPEC+ Production Moves",
            "description": "<div class=\"digest-article-content\">\n<p>Oil futures took a hit Thursday following a mixed bag of news from the U.S. Federal Reserve and a high profile meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. At 08:25 ET, December Brent crude slipped 0.7% to $63.86 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 0.7% to $60.06 per barrel. Both benchmarks are on track for a third straight monthly decline, each down over 3% for October amid ongoing concerns about an oversupplied market.</p><p>The Trump-Xi encounter in South Korea, staged on the sideline of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, was described by Trump as \"amazing\" - a diplomatic win of sorts. The U.S. president announced a tariff roll-back on China from 57% to 47% over a one-year period in exchange for resumed soybean purchases, continued exports of rare earth elements from China, and a crackdown on illegal fentanyl trade.</p><p>However, the devil's in the details, and those remain murky. Market watchers have taken a tempered view, seeing this more as a pause in hostilities rather than a lasting trade d√©tente. PVM analyst Tamas Varga noted that investors interpret the move as a de-escalation rather than a structural shift in U.S.-China relations.</p><p>The Federal Reserve's policy decision added another layer of complexity. The Fed went ahead with a 25 basis point rate cut as expected but signaled that further cuts may be off the table for the immediate future. Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted elevated economic uncertainty, citing particularly the drag from a prolonged government shutdown. The greenback jumped almost 0.6% overnight against a basket of currencies, weighing on commodities like oil, which are dollar-priced.</p><p>Even though lower rates generally stoke economic growth and oil demand, the hawkish undertone of the Fed's message curbed enthusiasm. Thursday's slight profit-taking pulled the dollar back about 0.2% during Asian trading, but the broader strength remains a headwind for crude prices.</p><p>Attention now shifts to the OPEC+ meeting slated for the weekend, where the oil cartel and its allies are expected to approve another production increase of 137,000 barrels per day in December. The group has persisted with output hikes despite market weakness, aiming to regain lost market share amid continued price pressure.</p><p>This cautious balancing act between output policy and demand signals is therefore central to where oil prices head next. With oversupply fears still prominent and geopolitical dynamics in flux, OPEC+ decisions could tip the scales.</p><p>In other commodities, U.S. soybean futures climbed 1.52%, likely buoyed by the trade developments. Meanwhile, metals like copper gave back some ground with a 2.37% drop, highlighting the uneven tone across raw materials.</p><p>Tensions between economic policy cues and geopolitical moves continue to cast long shadows over commodities. Whether the OPEC+ supply increase rattles markets further or stabilizes prices remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"digest-article-content\">\n<p>Cigna (NYSE: <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/CI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CI</a>) reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, largely driven by standout results in its health services division, Evernorth. This unit, which includes the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, has become a crucial profit engine amid a challenging insurance environment.</p><p>The company posted an adjusted profit of $7.83 per share, edging past Wall Street's consensus estimate of $7.65. Notably, Evernorth's revenue jumped about 15% to $60.39 billion, supported by growing client numbers and solid sales in Accredo, its specialty pharmacy focusing on costly medications.</p><p>Unlike many of its peers facing headwinds from government-backed insurance plans with soaring costs, Cigna has managed to buffer the impact thanks to its greater reliance on employer-sponsored plans and pharmacy benefit management services. Express Scripts' role in negotiating drug prices gives Cigna a competitive edge in controlling expenses in uncertain healthcare markets.</p><p>However, Cigna's medical care ratio-the percentage of premiums spent on medical claims-climbed to 84.8%, higher than the 82.8% registered in the previous year and above analyst estimates of 84.17%. This uptick is partly due to higher claims in the stop-loss insurance segment, which covers employers against catastrophic medical costs. The company reiterated that these increased stop-loss expenses align with its earlier forecasts.</p><p>Some investors were holding their breath given prior concerns about stop-loss exposure, but analysts, such as Mizuho's Ann Hynes, viewed the quarter positively, emphasizing that the feared pitfalls in Cigna's stop-loss business have so far been manageable.</p><p>Looking ahead, the insurer reaffirmed its full-year adjusted profit forecast at a minimum of $29.60 per share, just slightly below the $29.63 average analyst estimate. This suggests confidence in maintaining momentum despite healthcare sector uncertainties. Cigna plans to phase out prescription drug rebates in certain health plans by 2027, a move likely to reshape its pharmacy benefits approach.</p><p>Pre-market trading reflected optimism as shares edged up roughly 2%, settling near $305.20. Given Evernorth's significant contribution and Cigna's strategic positioning, the quarter delivered some relief following a period of cost pressures in the sector.</p><p>It remains to be seen how Cigna will navigate the evolving healthcare policies and pricing dynamics heading into 2026. Meanwhile, investors digest the numbers and comments from management's upcoming earnings call for clues about the year ahead.</p>\n</div>",

            "title": "Eli Lilly Crushes Q3 Estimates, Raises 2025 Forecast on Zepbound and Mounjaro Surge",
            "description": "<div class=\"digest-article-content\">\n<p>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (NYSE: <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/LLY\">LLY</a>) flexed its financial muscle this past quarter, reporting earnings and revenue figures that left Wall Street forecasts in the dust. The pharmaceutical heavyweight owes much of this momentum to blockbuster sales of its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The company's quarterly results prompted a 5% jump in premarket shares, signaling strong investor enthusiasm.</p><p>Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue got a notable lift, now projected between $63 billion and $63.5 billion-up from the earlier estimate of $60 to $62 billion. Adjusted profits should land in the $23 to $23.70 per share range, a step above the previous outlook. These revisions factor in current tariffs but steer clear of further drug import levies floated by President Donald Trump, which could shake things up if enacted.</p><p>Digging into specifics, Mounjaro's revenue skyrocketed to $6.52 billion over the quarter, more than doubling last year's numbers and outpacing the $5.51 billion analysts had penciled in. Zepbound, still relatively new on the market with roughly two years since launch, pulled in $3.57 billion-an eye-popping 184% increase year over year and inching past Wall Street targets. Altogether, Eli Lilly banked $17.60 billion in sales, a 54% jump from Q3 2024, with adjusted EPS leaping to $7.02 from an expected $5.69.</p><p>U.S. sales soared 45% to $11.30 billion, largely thanks to a 60% volume boost in prescriptions for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Of course, the company noted a dip in realized prices, a familiar trend when volumes ramp up so rapidly. Net income also saw a dramatic upswing, hitting $5.58 billion or $6.21 per share, way above last year's $970.3 million.</p><p>The GLP-1 market-which treats obesity and diabetes-is red hot, and Eli Lilly is elbowing in hard to keep a lead over rival Novo Nordisk. Over the past year, Lilly has grabbed significant share through savvy marketing and broadening access. For instance, a recent tie-up with Walmart lets cash-paying customers pick up discounted Zepbound vials in-store-a move that could shake up distribution dynamics.</p><p>Eyes are on Lilly's experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which could reinforce their stronghold if it delivers. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk, not standing still, launched a rival bid for U.S. biotech Metsera, sparking a bidding war with Pfizer as they aim to catch up in this lucrative corner of pharma.</p><p>Pricing pressures aside, the surge in demand for Lilly's GLP-1 therapies is unmistakable, and these Q3 numbers add fuel to their growth story. The company's significant volume gains show that these medicines are becoming a staple for managing obesity and diabetes conditions, even as competition heats up.</p><p>With the full-year numbers looking brighter and a pipeline that keeps investors guessing, the battle for GLP-1 supremacy is shaping up to be one of the year's most compelling pharma sagas.</p>\n</div>",

(NASDAQ: BL)</strong></a> to seriously consider selling itself, with SAP SE among the potential buyers. This call comes after a rejected takeover bid from SAP earlier this year, reportedly priced in the upper $60s per share range.</p><p>The activist fund's founder, Glenn Welling, penned a letter to BlackLine's board revealing Engaged Capital's substantial stake in the company and demanding the immediate engagement of financial advisors to investigate strategic alternatives. Welling contended that BlackLine's shares have been undervalued for some time, trading well below what he sees as their true worth.</p><p>According to the letter, BlackLine has yet to respond adequately to Engaged Capital's concerns. The investor's patience appears to be wearing thin, with Welling hinting at the possibility of a proxy fight at the upcoming annual meeting if the board refuses to explore a sale or alternative strategies.</p><p>For BlackLine, a financial software company based in Woodland Hills, California, this pressure amplifies ongoing debates about its strategic path. SAP's interest isn't a surprise, given how the software giant has been steadily acquiring cloud and finance-related assets to bolster its portfolio. BlackLine fits nicely into that strategy, focusing on automation and finance controls.</p><p>From SAP's perspective (<a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/SAP\"><strong>NYSE: SAP</strong></a>), snapping up BlackLine could bolster its offerings amid fierce competition in the enterprise software market. But the rejection earlier this year suggests BlackLine's leadership might be holding out for a better deal or a different future direction.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock's movement has caught some attention; a recent uptick in BlackLine's share price reflects rising speculation around takeover possibilities. Yet, without official talks resuming, these remain market whispers rather than confirmed negotiations.</p><p>The tension between an activist investor pushing for a sale and a board hesitant to jump signals a classic standoff scenario. This could reshape BlackLine's trajectory depending on how shareholders weigh in or if SAP comes back with an enhanced offer.</p><p>BlackLine's situation is a reminder of how corporate governance and shareholder activism can collide, potentially influencing stock prices and company strategies. Whether this standoff will escalate or settle quietly remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>",

This comfortably topped analyst predictions of $6.69 per share and $49.41 billion in revenue, but the good news took a backseat to investor concerns over a significant increase in the company's AI-related capital spending.</p><p>The tech giant raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast to a range of $70 billion to $72 billion, moving up from the prior $66 billion to $72 billion outlook. This jump in spending was enough to push shares down roughly 9%, as the market wrestled with the implications of heavy investment in AI development amid uncertain near-term returns.</p><p>Analyst reactions were mixed but mostly cautious. Oppenheimer downgraded Meta from outperform to perform, scrapping its $696 price target. The firm flagged the surge in operating and capital expenses projected for late 2025 and 2026, suggesting these costs might be tough for investors to justify until there's clearer visibility into 2027 revenue streams. They also compared Meta unfavorably to Alphabet (NASDAQ: <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/stock/GOOG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GOOG</a>), which trades at a similar forward P/E but offers more predictable earnings.</p><p>Benchmark Capital followed suit, dialing its rating down from buy to hold due to Meta's \"runaway capex\" and the challenge of delivering returns against well-funded AI competitors like OpenAI and Google. Their cautious stance reflects concerns around the company's ventures into areas beyond advertising, including robotics and evolving AI models.</p><p>Barclays retained an overweight rating but trimmed its price target to $770 from $810. The bank acknowledged that while new AI teams and investments are likely quality moves long-term, they will erode operating income growth for 2026 and squeeze free cash flow almost entirely during that period.</p><p>On a brighter note, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs maintained buy ratings but lowered their price targets to $810 and $815, respectively. Both emphasized Meta's strong user base and promising AI-driven products like content creation tools and large language models, though they acknowledged near-term pressure on earnings due to ramped-up spending.</p><p>Morgan Stanley and Citi also kept positive ratings. Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target to $820, noting disappointment in fourth-quarter revenue guidance but emphasizing the resilience of Meta's core platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Citi lowered its target to $850, projecting heavy 2026 capital expenditures nearing $111 billion but highlighting Meta's history of successful investment cycles that boost engagement and advertising revenues.</p><p>What's clear from this round of earnings and commentary is that Meta is doubling down on AI initiatives, with the cost growth raising questions about short-term profitability. The debate centers on whether these investments will eventually pay off or if the company risks stretching itself too thin as competition heats up and market patience wears thin.</p><p>As Meta navigates this cash-intensive phase amid evolving AI wars, the market waits to see if the gamble will spark a new growth chapter or weigh down the stock for an extended stretch.</p>\n</div>",

This move comes on the heels of earlier layoffs totaling 500 roles in 2025.</p><p>Sales figures haven't been kind to the brand either. For the third quarter, Puma's sales fell 10.4% on a currency-adjusted basis to 1.96 billion euros ($2.29 billion), narrowly missing the analyst forecast of 1.98 billion euros. The slump is partly a result of softer consumer demand and persistent headwinds tied to US tariffs affecting costs and margins.</p><p>The push for a leaner operation is led by the new CEO, Arthur Hoeld, who is spearheading the company's turnaround strategy. After a few rough quarters, Puma is eyeing a return to sales growth starting in 2027, though the path there looks challenging given ongoing economic uncertainties.</p><p>Earlier in March, the company unveiled its initial cost-saving program aimed at streamlining operations and containing expenses, but persistent market pressures have necessitated expanding these efforts. The job cuts this time around represent a significant step up in scale.</p><p>External factors such as trade tensions with the United States continue to weigh on Puma's top line. The brand hasn't escaped the ripple effects of tariffs, which have squeezed profitability and complicated global supply dynamics.</p><p>The sportswear sector at large has been grappling with fluctuating consumer interests and competitive pressure. Puma's latest results reflect a tough environment where maintaining market share demands constant adjustment and innovation.</p><p>With nearly 1,400 jobs trimmed over the course of this year, the company is clearly prioritizing operational efficiency. However, sales momentum remains sluggish, and Puma's story underscores the difficulties even established brands face amid shifting global economic currents.</p><p>Whether the company's focused restructuring will pay off sufficiently to revive growth in the near future remains to be seen.

The selloff followed a sharp reduction in its full-year financial outlook that caught the market off guard.</p><p>CEO Mike Lyons didn't sugarcoat the situation, candidly acknowledging in the company's statement that current results fell short of expectations from both management and shareholders. The revised guidance slashes adjusted earnings projections to between $8.50 and $8.60 per share, down from a prior forecast well above $10. Revenue growth estimates also plummeted, now expected in the low single digits instead of the previously guided 10%.</p><p>The latest quarterly earnings revealed $2.04 per share in adjusted profits, significantly under the $2.64 analysts anticipated. Meanwhile, revenues increased marginally by 1% year over year to $4.92 billion, missing estimates of $5.36 billion. That tepid revenue performance contrasted with a jump in net income to $792 million, up from $564 million a year ago.</p><p>In parallel with the disappointing financial update, Fiserv announced substantial changes to its leadership roster. Starting in December, Takis Georgakopoulos will step into a co-president role alongside Dhivya Suryadevara, former CEO from UnitedHealth Group's financial division. Meanwhile, Paul Todd moves up as the company's new CFO.</p><p>The board is also shaking up, welcoming Gordon Nixon as the independent chairman, along with new members C√©line Duf√©tel and Gary Shedlin, with Shedlin tasked with leading the audit committee. These moves suggest a clear intent to recalibrate governance amid mounting pressure.</p><p>Based in Milwaukee, Fiserv detailed a fresh strategy meant to jumpstart \"sustainable, high-quality growth\" and unlock its full potential, signaling an emphasis on operational improvement after recent underperformance.</p><p>Another notable development: Fiserv plans to transfer its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq next month, maintaining its ticker symbol FISV. This switch could have implications for the company's profile and investor base moving forward.</p><p>Despite the turmoil, CEO Lyons expressed confidence that the reshuffled leadership team has the experience needed to steer the company through tough waters and toward long-term stability.</p><p>Ultimately, the market's swift reaction underscores the challenges ahead for Fiserv, raising questions about whether these internal changes and revised forecasts mark the start of a turnaround or just the beginning of a rough patch.</p>\n</div>",

The focus now shifts to¬†trade tensions, earnings season, and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next moves.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"622\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.stockinvest.us/blog-stockinvest/2025/10/heatmap-35-ed478f.png\" width=\"1105\"/><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">S&amp;P500 (Week 41, 2025)</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"big-earnings-week-banks-and-chipmakers-take-center-stage\">Big Earnings Week: Banks and Chipmakers Take Center Stage</h3><p>This week kicks off a busy stretch of third-quarter results from major financial firms and tech companies.</p><ul><li><strong>Banks:</strong>¬†JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Citigroup all report on Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Later in the week, American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street will wrap up the financial lineup.</li><li><strong>Tech &amp; Chips:</strong>¬†Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) reports Thursday after strong AI chip sales boosted its revenue 40% in the first half of 2025. ASML follows on Wednesday after raising concerns about tariffs and slowing demand for chip equipment.</li><li><strong>Tech events:</strong>¬†Oracle‚Äôs¬†<em>AI World</em>¬†conference begins Monday, and Salesforce‚Äôs¬†<em>Dreamforce</em>¬†starts Tuesday ‚Äî both likely to bring attention to artificial intelligence and enterprise tech. <a href=\"https://stockinvest.us/tools/earnings-calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Earnings Calendar &gt;&gt;</a></li></ul><h3 id=\"data-delays-and-fed-watch\">Data Delays and Fed Watch</h3><p>The¬†federal government shutdown, now entering its third week, is likely to delay several key reports, including¬†retail sales, inflation (PPI), housing starts, and jobless claims. Some data will still come through, like the¬†NFIB Small Business Optimism Index¬†on Tuesday and¬†homebuilder confidence¬†on Thursday.</p><p>Investors will also tune in to¬†Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs speech on Tuesday, along with comments from Fed officials, including Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller. The Fed‚Äôs¬†Beige Book, which gives an overview of economic conditions across regions, will be released on Wednesday.</p><h3 id=\"market-context\">Market Context</h3><p>Bond markets will be closed on Monday for¬†Columbus Day (also observed as Indigenous Peoples Day), but stock exchanges will remain open. </p><p>With limited economic data and uncertainty around Washington‚Äôs budget standoff, markets are likely to take their cues from corporate earnings and Fed commentary.</p><p>In short, this week is about¬†navigating through noise¬†‚Äî balancing worries over tariffs and the shutdown against potential optimism from strong bank and chipmaker earnings. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"113\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbmGHbiOxxM?feature=oembed\" title=\"?
