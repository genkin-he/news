            "description": "<h1 data-start=\"220\" data-end=\"290\">Stock earnings yesterday, insights you don’t see on the price charts, and an Amazon slam dunk</h1><p data-start=\"292\" data-end=\"412\"><strong>Hi investors and traders at investingLive.com, here is a beginner friendly snapshot </strong>of stock earnings yesterday. See which companies moved more or less than expected, why priced in means size not direction, and how to read the reactions with confidence. And if you're a pro, you're still likely to appreciate the analysis we've cooked up for you. Let's dive in...</p><h2 data-start=\"739\" data-end=\"774\">Yesterday’s Earnings at a Glance</h2><p data-start=\"776\" data-end=\"988\">Sixteen S&amp;P 500 companies reported results. Half rose and half fell. On average the group barely moved. That tells us the market had already prepared for most of what came out. In other words many results were priced in.</p><p data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1142\"><strong data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1008\">Plain English:</strong> priced in is about how big the move might be. It does not say which way. The options market sets an expected move for up or for down.</p><h2 data-start=\"1144\" data-end=\"1191\">Standouts. Actual Move Next to Expected Move</h2><p data-start=\"1193\" data-end=\"1296\">Putting the actual move right next to the expected move helps beginners see reality versus preparation.</p><ul data-start=\"1298\" data-end=\"1570\"><li data-start=\"1298\" data-end=\"1352\"><p data-start=\"1300\" data-end=\"1352\"><strong data-start=\"1300\" data-end=\"1316\">Amazon AMZN:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1317\" data-end=\"1350\">+13.2% vs about 5.9% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1353\" data-end=\"1405\"><p data-start=\"1355\" data-end=\"1405\"><strong data-start=\"1355\" data-end=\"1370\">Apple AAPL:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1371\" data-end=\"1403\">+2.3% vs about 3.3% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1406\" data-end=\"1468\"><p data-start=\"1408\" data-end=\"1468\"><strong data-start=\"1408\" data-end=\"1432\">Cardinal Health CAH:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1433\" data-end=\"1466\">+15.4% vs about 4.5% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1469\" data-end=\"1520\"><p data-start=\"1471\" data-end=\"1520\"><strong data-start=\"1471\" data-end=\"1484\">Cigna CI:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1485\" data-end=\"1518\">−17.4% vs about 5.2% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1521\" data-end=\"1570\"><p data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1570\"><strong data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1537\">Altria MO:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1538\" data-end=\"1570\">−7.8% vs about 3.5% expected</strong></p></li></ul><p data-start=\"1572\" data-end=\"1699\">So a few names made big moves. Many others were quiet. Two very large companies carried most of the positive headline.</p><h2 data-start=\"1701\" data-end=\"1743\">Surprise Share. Quiet Tape or Live Wire</h2><p data-start=\"1745\" data-end=\"2019\">About four in ten companies moved more than their expected move. That is meaningful for the first trading window. Option prices usually include a safety cushion. Many options also cover more than a single session. Seeing that much exceed the mark right away is worth noting.</p><p data-start=\"2021\" data-end=\"2211\"><strong data-start=\"2021\" data-end=\"2042\">New investor tip:</strong> if a stock moves less than expected, option buyers may have paid for protection they did not end up needing. If a stock moves more than expected, that protection helps.</p><h2 data-start=\"2213\" data-end=\"2286\">Concentration Watch. Why the Headline Looked Stronger Than the Average</h2><p data-start=\"2288\" data-end=\"2480\">Two mega caps did most of the lifting: Amazon, mainly, and some more minor support from Apple (will the Apple positive move hold today? Mmm... that would be interesting to watch, mayb not for long... See below). </p><p data-start=\"2288\" data-end=\"2480\">This can make the headline look healthy even when the middle of the pack is mixed. It is common in modern indexes and it matters for portfolio decisions.</p><p data-start=\"2482\" data-end=\"2650\"><strong data-start=\"2482\" data-end=\"2512\">What you can do with this:</strong> do not chase the headline alone. Look for steady names that held up beneath the surface. Calm days can still hide a change in leadership.</p><h2 data-start=\"2652\" data-end=\"2711\">Stock Earnings Yesterday. What New Investors Can Do Next</h2><ul data-start=\"2713\" data-end=\"3151\"><li data-start=\"2713\" data-end=\"2809\"><p data-start=\"2715\" data-end=\"2809\">No broad breakout detected. Many companies matched what the market had already prepared for.</p></li><li data-start=\"2810\" data-end=\"2881\"><p data-start=\"2812\" data-end=\"2881\">Watch for concentration. A strong headline can hide a flat average.</p></li><li data-start=\"2882\" data-end=\"2994\"><p data-start=\"2884\" data-end=\"2994\">Remember that the expected move is direction neutral. It describes the size of the swing. Not the direction.</p></li><li data-start=\"2995\" data-end=\"3151\"><p data-start=\"2997\" data-end=\"3151\">Options note. Smaller than expected moves often mean a comfort premium stayed with sellers. Larger than expected moves reward those who bought protection.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"3153\" data-end=\"3185\">Earnings Basics for Beginners</h2><ul data-start=\"3187\" data-end=\"3372\"><li data-start=\"3187\" data-end=\"3296\"><p data-start=\"3189\" data-end=\"3296\"><strong data-start=\"3189\" data-end=\"3207\">Expected move:</strong> the options based estimate of how big a stock might swing around earnings. Up or down.</p></li><li data-start=\"3297\" data-end=\"3372\"><p data-start=\"3299\" data-end=\"3372\"><strong data-start=\"3299\" data-end=\"3313\">Priced in:</strong> means size was anticipated. It does not predict direction.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"3374\" data-end=\"3405\">Yesterday’s One Line Earnings Snapshot</h2><p data-start=\"3407\" data-end=\"3460\">Stable overall. A few punchy movers carried the tape. With Amazon winning yesterday' earnings slam dunk competition (a wink to its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sports/nba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">cooperation with the NBA</a>, and who doesn't like the NBA, right?)</p>",

            "title": "Fraud and fear in finance: Octa broker unveils the shocking stories of rogue traders",
            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In the public imagination, large investment banks and brokerage houses are often portrayed as selfish, profit-seeking, and almost immoral institutions that operate with impunity to exploit and rob the hard-working people through predatory practices and systemic greed. The 2008 financial crisis only solidified this view for many. Indeed, financial markets are tough, and the unchecked opportunism of many of their participants often hurts the little man. However, while abuse and corporate misconduct certainly have their place, financial history is also filled with shocking cases where the sole villain was, in fact, the little man himself. There have been notorious instances where the actions of a single, non-executive team member—a sole trader in a distant office, or a mid-level manager—destroyed the very banks they worked for, shattering their reputations at best and wiping out centuries of corporate history at worst. Driven by ego and fear, these individuals managed to single-handedly inflict catastrophic losses on banks that employ them and the clients they serve, exposing glaring weaknesses in risk oversight. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Octa broker presents to you a list of 'rogue traders' whose reckless decisions to engage in fraudulent, unauthorised, and highly speculative trades resulted in severe financial damage to important banks, sometimes leading to their outright collapse. These cases are a stark reminder that no system is immune to individual misconduct.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Below are the most notorious cases, ranked roughly by the scale of losses adjusted for inflation and impact.</p><ol><li><strong>Jerome Kerviel (Société Générale) </strong><p dir=\"ltr\">Jerome Kerviel, a junior trader at French bank Société Générale, orchestrated one of the largest rogue trading scandals ever, resulting in a staggering <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/20/business/trading-scandal-at-sumitomo-causes-1.9-billion-loss-its-first.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">€4.9 billion ($7.1 billion) loss</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kerviel used his prior experience in the compliance department to bypass controls by creating fake hedging transactions to mask his massive, directional trades on European stock indices, including the DAX, CAC, and EuroStoxx 50. He built positions worth €50 billion, far exceeding his limits, and more than the bank's own market capitalisation. He wasn't diverting funds to a personal account—reports suggest he was driven by a desire to prove he was a trading genius, obsessed with beating the system. When his trades were finally discovered in January 2008, the bank had no choice but to liquidate them immediately, which locked in the catastrophic losses. The scandal prompted Société Générale to overhaul its risk systems and pay hefty fines. Kerviel was sentenced to three years in prison (serving five months) and ordered to repay the full amount, though this was later reduced on appeal.</p></li><li><strong>Yasuo Hamanaka (Sumitomo Corporation)</strong><p dir=\"ltr\">Known as 'Mr. Copper' for controlling 5% of the global copper market, Yasuo Hamanaka caused $2.6 billion in losses through unauthorised trades and market manipulation at Japanese trading giant <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/20/business/trading-scandal-at-sumitomo-causes-1.9-billion-loss-its-first.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sumitomo</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rogue trading isn't just a 21st-century phenomenon, nor is it limited to stocks and futures. For over a decade, Yasuo Hanamaka, the chief copper trader at Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, attempted to control the entire global copper market. He forged documents and conducted off-book deals on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to artificially inflate copper prices, generating short-term profits while hiding mounting deficits. In 1996, when regulators stepped in to investigate his activities, the scheme unravelled, leading to a sharp drop in copper prices. Hamanaka was sentenced to eight years in prison for fraud and forgery. Sumitomo settled with regulators for $150 million, and its accomplices, including Merrill Lynch, faced fines. This case highlighted how one trader's dominance and lack of oversight could distort entire commodity markets.</p></li><li><strong>Kweku Adoboli (UBS)</strong><p dir=\"ltr\">Ghanaian trader Kweku Adoboli, who worked at UBS, a Swiss bank, racked up $2.3 billion in losses through unauthorised trades in stock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/20/ubs-trader-kweku-adoboli-jailed-fraud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">index futures</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In 2011, Adoboli exceeded his trading limits by booking fictitious hedges and exploiting internal systems to hide positions in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) tied to indices such as the S&amp;P 500 and EuroStoxx. He was essentially running a secret, high-stakes hedge fund of his own within the bank he worked for. His positions, involving strategies like forward settling, ballooned to $2.3 billion in losses amid market volatility. In court, he claimed that it was corporate pressure to perform amid a volatile market that led to his actions, but prosecutors argued it was a fraud. The losses wiped out UBS's quarterly profits, leading to the CEO's resignation. Arrested at 31, Adoboli was convicted and sentenced to seven years, serving half before deportation to Ghana. UBS strengthened controls and faced regulatory scrutiny amid a damaged reputation.</p></li><li><strong>Nick Leeson (Barings Bank)</strong><p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps the most famous rogue trader, Nick Leeson single-handedly collapsed Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings, with £827 million ($1.4 billion) in losses from unauthorised futures trades on the Nikkei 225 and Japanese government bonds.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">From Barings' Singapore office, Leeson was making his own unauthorised speculative trades in Nikkei futures, hiding losses in a secret '88888' error account. He was doubling down on losing positions—a strategy that amplified risks. His supervisors failed to separate his trading desk and back-office settlement duties, which was a critical failure of internal oversight. In total, Leeson had accumulated £827 million ($1.4 billion) in losses—double the bank's entire trading capital. On 26 February 1995, Barings Bank, a 233-year-old institution listing Queen Elizabeth II among its clients, was declared insolvent and was later sold to the Dutch bank ING for the symbolic sum of £1. Leeson was convicted and sentenced to six and a half years in Changi Prison in Singapore. His story was later adapted into the 1999 movie Rogue Trader, in which Ewan McGregor played the role of Nick Leeson.</p></li><li><strong>Toshihide Iguchi (Daiwa Bank)</strong><p dir=\"ltr\">Toshihide Iguchi, U.S.-based executive at Japan's Daiwa Bank, confessed to $1.1 billion in losses from unauthorised U.S. Treasury bond trades that ran over 11 years.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Iguchi's scheme began with a small loss in 1984, which he tried to recover. The lack of segregation between the front office (trading) and the back office (settlement) allowed him to falsify over 30,000 trading slips over the years. Eventually, in 1995,  in a 30-page confession letter to his boss, he revealed the scheme. Iguchi was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $2.6 million. The Federal Reserve (Fed) ordered Daiwa Bank to cease all operations in the United States, forcing the sale of its US assets. Iguchi later wrote books on his 'billion-dollar education', reflecting on the psychological traps of trading.</p></li><li><strong>John Rusnak (Allied Irish Bank)</strong><p dir=\"ltr\">In 2002, the Baltimore-based foreign exchange trader John Rusnak was found to have hidden trading losses of nearly $700 million at Allfirst Financial, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank (AIB).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rusnak bet heavily on the yen rising against the dollar without hedging, using fake options contracts and identities. Suspicion arose when firms like Goldman Sachs refused deals, and Rusnak’s 'martingale' strategy of doubling bets failed. The scandal led to Allfirst's sale and job losses, exposing lax oversight in foreign exchange desks. Rusnak was sentenced to seven and a half years (serving six).</p></li></ol><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The extraordinary tales of rogue traders like Leeson, Kerviel, and Adoboli are dramatic and costly reminders of where unchecked human ambition can lead if it is not met with robust institutional oversight and individual discipline. The executives and risk managers at these sophisticated, multi-billion-dollar institutions often knew nothing about the true scope or risk of the operations occurring right under their noses. The cases we outlined reveal a common thread: a failure to maintain the critical separation of duties, a lack of independent monitoring, and the perilous, ego-driven hope to 'trade out' of a bad situation and recover losses through escalation. Therefore, robust risk management is an absolute necessity for every institution engaging in the financial markets. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">These cases also serve as a lesson for retail traders: a lack of control can lead to personal financial ruin. At Octa broker, we believe in a transparent and disciplined approach to trading. We have been providing access to financial markets for retail traders since 2011, and we consistently stress that trading is not gambling. Trading is a discipline of analysis, strategy, and calculated risk management. Chasing losses, exceeding established limits, or making unauthorised, 'all-or-nothing' bets is a recipe for disaster. </p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This article does not contain or constitute investment advice or recommendations and does not consider your investment objectives, financial situation, or needs.

            "title": "The Importance Of Crypto Literacy In 2025",
            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrency has moved from the domain of coders to determining the future of retirement funds, corporate payments, and finance in general. Yet most people don’t know what a blockchain is or why scammers want your seed phrase. Fast forward to 2025, and the distinction between wallets and exchanges, an understanding of “tokenomics,” and regulatory awareness allow the average user to look out for their own interests and identify opportunities in a market driven by hype.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Role of Crypto Literacy Today</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto rails can open new opportunities for payments, remittances, and savings, particularly where traditional banking is costly or not offered at all. You no longer need a bank to send money home, save for the future, or start a business. You just need a smartphone. For millions of people, that’s a shift in thegame.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is still a hotbed for scams, be it phishing texts, false “support” accounts, or an all-of-the-sudden “rug pull” where a token disappears post social media pump. Private key compromises accounted for the largest share (43.8%) of stolen crypto. Literacy means recognizing the red flags before you lose your money.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Gone are the days when you could simply follow the latest trending coin. Today, it’s critical for everyone, rather than just day traders, to understand how trading fees function, what assets are being locked, and how to use a blockchain explorer. For example, when new tokens launch on major exchanges, some traders jump in without checking fundamentals, leading to potential losses. That’s why it’s important to consult reliable sources, such as these <a href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/new-binance-listings/\">best Binance new listings</a>, which provide verified information on newly listed tokens and their details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Major changes are underway in crypto regulation. The GENIUS Act now requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets, while the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is reshaping how the SEC and CFTC oversee digital assets. These developments highlight why crypto users must stay informed.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Policy and Corporate Adoption: More Choice, More Risk</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Retirement Policy:</strong><br>The White House signed an order on August 7, 2025, allowing 401K access to crypto and nontraditional assets. Proponents say it’s a boon for diversification, while detractors worry about increased fees, legal hassles, and dangerous volatility. Where both sides are correct: Americans need legitimate crypto education before changing their retirement plan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Market Moves:</strong><br>This month, policy tailwinds and regulatory headwinds have sent bitcoin prices soaring to new all-time highs, but there are reasons why the bull market shouldn’t result in a bulls-only mentality. Savers who do not understand the risks of volatility, liquidity traps, and custody quirks will chase returns and end in regret.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Corporate Adoption:</strong><br>Tesla is noted for its back-and-forth crypto policies. The company briefly accepted bitcoin as payment for cars before reversing this decision 49 days later. However, you can still <a href=\"https://cryptoprocessing.com/learn/who-accepts-dogecoin\">purchase Tesla merch using Dogecoin</a>. Companies change policies rapidly, and verifying and double-checking has become a necessary skill.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges That Raise the Stakes</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most fundamental problems regarding crypto is a lack of knowledge. Many users do not fully understand private keys, seed phrases, or even wallet security at a high level, and keep their funds on exchanges, ceding control and risking losing them if the company collapses. The regulatory environment is also fragmented as law depends on the state or country. The hype by these “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-025-00947-1\">crypto influencers</a>” is questionable and can mislead newcomers. Fact-checking and source-checking are critical. Those looking to venture into crypto need to have an understanding of volatility, fees, and custody prior to converting long-term savings into crypto or any other volatile assets.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Building Your Crypto Knowledge: The Essentials</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">1.      Wallets &amp; Keys: Know the difference between “hot” online wallets and “cold” hardware storage. Never share your seed phrase; not even with customer support.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2.      Exchanges: Learn how centralized exchanges handle withdrawals, charge fees, and what liquidity “depth” means for your order size.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3.      Tokenomics &amp; Events: Emissions, vesting schedules, governance votes, and major exchange listings can all change asset value overnight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4.      Security: Recognize common scams - phishing messages, fake websites, and malicious contract approvals. Revoke permissions when in doubt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5.      Regulatory Changes: Keep up with U.S. policy on retirement accounts, IRS rules, and make sure your broker provides plain-English disclosures.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6.      Begin with government publications, policies (rather than headlines or social media), and look for coverage in non-partisan, neutral news sources for any market-moving news.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Way Forward: Access With Education</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">New crypto alternatives should have resources and guides that clearly explain them. Concepts such as wallets, custody, and market structure should be taught in personal finance education. Resources should provide concise overviews of risks, fees, and custody, with disclosures matching the protections offered to experienced investors in traditional investments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is more mainstream, but having access is not enough. Literacy is what prevents investors from unnecessary losses. Only invest what you understand, be curious, learn the basics, and inquire. This is the appropriate kind of digital financial safeguard these days, overall responsible participation.</p>",
