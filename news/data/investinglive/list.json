            "description": "<p>If you want to know how talks are going between Iran and the USA then you don't need to look any further than the intraday WTI crude oil chart. It was lower earlier on some profit taking ahead of talks but since the talks ended, it's been one-way traffic higher.</p><p>Reports continue to highlight that the US has taken minimalist positions, including a reversal of conventional missile production,  exporting enriched uranium out of the country and destroying nuclear (or not?) sites. There is also the thorny issue of regional proxies, which Iran formally denies.</p><p>The main signal the market continues to see is the massive US military buildup in the region. Talk is around something like 5-day massive aerial bombardment by the US and Israel. One report says Israel is being prodded to attack first as some kind of cover for US involvement. That doesn't really pass the smell test but last month the US abducted Venezuela's head of state so we're not really playing the old games anymore. </p><p>The only real question here is what capability does Iran have regarding striking back and whether the US is willing to tolerate a militarily-diminished regime staying in power. Perhaps Venezuela is instrumental here as it looks like largely business as usual after Maduro was sent to a US prison with his wife.</p><p>In any case, there isn't much value in speculating on what either Trump or the Iranian regime will do. It's all wait-and-see at this point but the long history of geopolitical trades on oil almost always favors a 'sell the fact' stance as conflicts are rarely as long or intense as the fears about them. Moreover, no one has much incentive to destroy oil infrastructure. </p><p>In terms of the technicals, a break of $67.28 would be the best level since July.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The problem with being all show is that eventually you have to deliver real results. Earlier today there was a Politico report about Howard Lutnick and how the vast majority of his $18 trillion in touted investment deals into the US is basically smoke-and-mirrors, AI investment, or a repackaging of things that were already announced.</p><p>Now, the SCMP is out with a <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3344769/trump-xi-summit-preparations-falter-planning-gaps-unsettle-beijing?module=top_story&amp;pgtype=homepage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">report </a>saying Chinese officials are unsettled about a planned April meeting between Xi and Trump because there could be nothing to announce.</p><blockquote>\"Preparations are inadequate, bilateral contacts anaemic and outcomes diminished, according to analysts and former government officials familiar with planning,\" the report says.</blockquote><p>According to analysts and former officials, the US side has barely shown up to the process. The problem is that no one can seem to get a decision out of anyone but Bessent, Witkoff and Kushner but they're also preoccupied with many other files.</p><p>The core tension here is a classic one: Beijing wants a heavily choreographed, no-surprises event with deliverables locked in months ahead of time. They literally count the number of steps Xi takes to reach the restroom. Trump wants to walk in, trust his gut, and improvise a deal. As one analyst put it in the report: \"Xi's doing classical music and Trump's doing free jazz.\"</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Expect Boeing aircraft sales and soy purchases to be dressed up as big wins.

The technology sector demonstrates resilience, while semiconductors experience notable declines. Let’s delve into the details.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>📈 Technology Sector: A Bright Spot</strong><br>The technology sector shines brightly today. <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> gains 0.86% and <strong>Oracle (ORCL)</strong> increases by 0.75%, reflecting robust investor confidence. This upward trend suggests strengthening fundamentals and positive market sentiment towards tech infrastructure stocks.</li>\n\n<li><strong>📉 Semiconductor Setback</strong><br>In contrast, semiconductors encounter challenges. <strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> slides by 2.15% and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> drops by 1.31%, painting a picture of investor caution within this crucial tech sub-sector. Industry-specific pressures and global supply chain issues may be influencing these declines.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🏦 Financial Firmness</strong><br>The financial sector holds firm, with <strong>JPMorgan Chase (JPM)</strong> up by 0.89% and <strong>Visa (V)</strong> rising 0.52%. This stability may be attributed to positive economic outlooks and a resilient banking infrastructure supporting investor sentiments.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🚗 From Consumer Cyclical to Defensives</strong><br>The consumer cyclical landscape offers mixed signals; while <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is marginally down by 0.09%, consumer defensive giants such as <strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> enjoy a 0.59% increase, hinting at a strategic shift towards safer, defensive investments amid market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Market Mood and Trends: Navigating the Mixed Signals</h2>\n<p>The market sentiment today is marked by sector-specific dynamics. While tech infrastructure stocks reflect positive trends driven by innovation and robust earnings, semiconductors face headwinds likely due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain worries.</p>\n<p>Investors appear cautious but hopeful, pivoting towards defensives as a hedge against market uncertainties. This suggests a strategic shift to mitigate potential risks in historically volatile sectors.</p>\n\n<h2>Strategic Recommendations: Navigating the Patchwork</h2>\n<p>Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to encompass a balanced mix of technology infrastructure and defensive sectors. Given the current pulse of the semiconductor market, staying vigilant on global news and sector reports will be prudent.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider increasing exposure in technology infrastructure stocks like MSFT and ORCL.</li>\n<li>Cautiously evaluate semiconductor investments until clearer signals emerge.</li>\n<li>Explore defensive stocks for portfolio stability, especially in consumer goods like WMT and PG.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stay informed with real-time data and analyses at <a href=\"https://www.investinglive.com\">InvestingLive.com</a> to guide your investment strategies in such a dynamic market environment.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">NVIDIA delivered a monster Q4, posting record revenue of $68.1 billion — comfortably ahead of the $66.2 billion consensus estimate — with earnings of $1.62 per share (non-GAAP). Revenue surged 73% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by the data center juggernaut, which pulled in $62.3 billion and now accounts for 91% of total sales.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But the real headline was guidance. NVIDIA expects Q1 revenue of $78 billion (±2%), blowing past the $72.6 billion consensus and marking what would be the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Jensen Huang talked up the \"agentic AI inflection point\" and touted Blackwell as delivering an order-of-magnitude lower cost per token for inference workloads.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Yet the stock is up barely 1% in pre-market. That tells you everything about where the market's head is at right now — and looming large is what happened last quarter. After NVIDIA's Q3 report in November, shares spiked 4% in the initial after-hours reaction on another beat-and-raise, only to reverse and finish the following session 2% lower. Traders got burned chasing that move, and the memory of it is keeping a lid on enthusiasm this time around.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The broader debate has moved past whether NVIDIA can hit its numbers — it clearly can — and toward whether the hyperscaler capex cycle is sustainable. The big cloud players have seen more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps since early February on exactly those fears. AMD got punished 17% despite beating expectations.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The question is whether NVDA's customers can turn their huge investments into chips into revenues and profits (and free cash flow) of their own, and whether the market is willing to wait years for that to unfold.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On the face of it though, the numbers are astonishing: Full-year revenue hit $215.9 billion, up 65%. Gross margins held up at 75% for the quarter. NVIDIA returned $41.1 billion to shareholders in FY26 (though much of that was eaten up by share-based comp).</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The numbers are pristine. The question is whether the market is ready to pay up for them when the macro AI narrative is under pressure — and whether this time, the post-earnings fade finally breaks.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In terms of the chart, it looks good to me as it tries to break out of the recent consolidation ahead of a fresh test of $212. One thing that lingers is a recent Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/mega-cap-tech-most-under-owned-in-17-years-says-morgan-stanley-20260219/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">report </a>saying that Nvidia is the most under-owned large-cap tech stock among institutional investors. Now could be the moment they pile in.</p>",

As we head toward the North American session and the end of the week,\nthe focus shifts to whether these pairs can break out of tight ranges and\nestablish clearer directional control.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>EURUSD technical analysis: Tight weekly range keeps\ntraders waiting</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <strong>EURUSD remains confined to a narrow 70-pip range for\nthe week</strong>, signaling a market still searching for conviction. That type of\ncompression often precedes expansion. The key question is whether buyers or\nsellers can force a breakout and extend the range.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Upside resistance levels</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The high today stalled at <strong>1.1830</strong>, the 50% midpoint of\nthe recent move. Monday’s high reached <strong>1.1834</strong> before rotating lower.\nThat 1.1830–1.1834 area is key resistance.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A break and sustained move above that zone would increase\nthe bullish bias and shift focus toward:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\">1.1860\n     as the next upside target</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">1.1889,\n     the broken 38.2% retracement of the 2026 trading range</li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Until that area is cleared, upside momentum remains limited.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Downside support levels</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The European session rotation lower pushed price below the <strong>200-hour\nMA at 1.1801</strong>, but buyers stepped in at the <strong>100-hour MA near 1.1793</strong>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the price falls below the 100-hour MA, traders will look\ntoward:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\">1.1765–1.1778,\n     the swing area floor for the week</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">1.1741,\n     last week’s double bottom</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">1.1691,\n     where the 100-day MA comes into focus</li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A break below the weekly floor would likely increase\ndownside momentum.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>EURUSD outlook:</strong> The pair remains range-bound, but\npressure is building. A decisive move outside the 70-pip range could trigger a\nstronger directional run.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>USDJPY technical analysis: Failed breakout shifts\nmomentum lower</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <strong>USDJPY is correcting earlier gains</strong> after failing\non a topside breakout.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yesterday’s rally pushed above the <strong>156.20–156.28 swing\narea</strong> and extended through a topside trendline near <strong>156.60</strong>, but the\nbreak could not be sustained. The pair rotated lower into the close.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the Asian session today, price broke back below <strong>156.20</strong>,\naccelerated to a low of <strong>155.72</strong>, and then bounced.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Key pivot level: 156.20–156.28</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This former support zone now acts as resistance and remains\nthe key short-term barometer.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the price moves back above 156.28 and holds, buyers\nregain control.<br>\nIf the price stays below 156.20, sellers maintain the edge.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On further downside pressure, the next target is the rising <strong>100-hour\nMA near 155.47</strong>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>USDJPY outlook:</strong> The failed breakout shifts the\nshort-term bias lower unless buyers can reclaim the 156.20–156.28 zone.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>GBPUSD technical analysis: Buyers defending short-term\nsupport</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <strong>GBPUSD made a new Asian session high</strong>, breaking\nabove yesterday’s high near <strong>1.3565</strong> and reaching <strong>1.3575</strong>. However,\nit stalled just ahead of the swing resistance zone between <strong>1.3582 and 1.3590</strong>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the European session, price rotated lower:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Broke\n     below the 200-hour MA at 1.3526</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Moved\n     under the 1.3526–1.3537 swing area</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Found\n     support ahead of the rising 100-hour MA at 1.3512</li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The pair has since rebounded and is now trading back above <strong>1.3536</strong>.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Holding above that reclaimed swing area keeps buyers in\nshort-term control. A move back below would shift focus toward the 100-hour MA.\nA break above 1.3575 would bring the 1.3582–1.3590 resistance zone back into\nplay.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>GBPUSD outlook:</strong> Buyers remain active, but upside\nmomentum needs to clear the 1.3580 area to strengthen the bullish case.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>North American session focus</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Across the board, these pairs are sitting near inflection\npoints:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li class=\"MsoNormal\">EURUSD\n     remains compressed within its weekly range</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">USDJPY\n     is testing sellers after a failed breakout</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">GBPUSD\n     is trying to hold reclaimed support</li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\">As we move into the North American session and toward the\nweekly close, watch for range expansion and momentum confirmation around the\nkey technical levels outlined above.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">...</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">BOJ governor Ueda came out today with a bold statement, at least by his standards, in saying that their upcoming policy meetings in March and April will be <em>live</em>. The timing of that remark says a lot as it comes after his meeting with prime minister Takaichi, as well as the report yesterday that Takaichi voiced her concerns and reluctance towards the BOJ hiking rates again.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In terms of what might trigger the BOJ to act, it is all on the spring wage negotiations. The expected wage benchmark should see the 5% level hit again, which might compel the central bank to take action. But if they are not careful enough, they might just miss their timing to do so. That as we are about to see a reshuffle in policymakers making up the BOJ board.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Current policymakers Asahi Noguchi and Junko Nakagawa will be seeing their respective term end on 31 March and 29 June respectively. And prime minister Takaichi already has lined up her candidates of choice in replacing them.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">For some background, Noguchi is a dovish member but did pivot to support the last two rate hikes to bring the policy rate to 0.75%. As such, markets will be watching closely to see if he will deliver a \"parting gift\" in March to support one more rate hike before leaving.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for Nakagawa, she is more of a consensus voter at the central bank. In other words, she tends to stick with the general leanings of the majority of the board at the time. So, losing her is basically losing a <em>swing vote</em> so to speak in supporting the majority leanings of the BOJ board. But for now, at least she will stay on until the June meeting.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">So, who are the ones replacing them?</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Takaichi has lined up Toichiro Asada and Ayano Sato as the replacements to both Noguchi and Nakagawa respectively.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The idea is to put Asada and Sato in place to act as block and counterweight to the more hawkish leanings that the central bank wants to pursue.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">While on paper they do look like dove-for-dove replacements to Noguchi and Nakagawa, they are more reflationist in nature and that could provide some pushback against the BOJ's plans to hike rates moving forward.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Of note, Asada ascribes to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and argues that that debt doesn't matter as much as growth. In other words, the emphasis of his core principle is the necessity for coordinated fiscal and monetary policy to stabilise the economy.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for Sato, she is more from a legal background. And while her policy leanings aren't as clear, it is more than likely that she will favour a more institutional perspective in aligning with the government's goal of ensuring that monetary normalisation does not stifle economic growth.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">With all that in consideration, the BOJ might just be up against the clock in being able to deliver their next rate hike. If not careful, they could just miss that timing window.</p>",

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 rebounded\nfrom the monthly lows as risk sentiment improved. There was no real catalyst\nfor the move as the market continues to trade in a range amid uncertainty on\nthe macro and geopolitical fronts. </p><p>The short-term uncertainty\ncaused by the US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs might have weighed on the\nmarket, but in the bigger picture it didn’t change much as Trump quickly\nreimposed new tariffs using different laws. The new levies reduce the effective\naverage tariff rate, which could be a positive at the margin. </p><p>In terms of Fed interest\nrates path, the market is still pricing 54 bps of easing by year-end which\ncould be at risk of a hawkish repricing on further improvement in the US labour\nmarket data. In fact, Fed’s Waller mentioned that he might want to hold rates\nsteady if we see a repeat of the strong January’s NFP report. Therefore, next\nFriday is going to be key as good data could weigh on the market in the\nshort-term on a hawkish repricing. </p><p>Lastly, we have the US-Iran\nmilitary escalation risk. This is one of the biggest risks because if a\nmilitary conflict were to break out, we would see oil prices skyrocket. This\nwould be a negative shock for the global economy and lead to stagflation risks.\nThe first reaction in the markets would be strong risk aversion. We would\nhighly likely see a selloff in the stock market as future growth expectations\nwould turn negative.</p><p>To sum up, there are lots\nof downside risks at the moment with little reasons for a rally into new\nall-time highs. Nonetheless, the macro backdrop remains positive given the\neasing inflation and improving labour market, but that could change quickly, so\ntraders will need to be careful.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe daily chart, we can see that\nthe S&amp;P 500 rebounded from the monthly\nlows and it’s approaching the all-time highs. If the price gets there, we can\nexpect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the record highs, to\nposition for a drop back into the 6,760 support. The buyers, on the other hand,\nwill want to see the price breaking higher to increase the bullish bets into\nnew record highs.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe 4 hour chart, we have a\nstrong support zone around the 6,930 level. If we get a pullback, we can expect\nthe buyers to step in around the support with a defined risk below it to keep\npushing into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nlower to pile back in and target the 6,760 support. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500 TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup\naround the support, while the sellers will need a break lower to open the door\nfor a drop into the 6,760 support.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">The big story in the equities market came after the close yesterday, with Nvidia delivering a major beat in their earnings report across the board. That saw shares of the tech giant rose by over 3% for a brief period in after-hours trading before settling with more modest gains. In turn, broader market sentiment also retreated and that's making for a more tepid mood seen in Asia and early European morning trade thus far.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.1% currently, with Nasdaq futures also down 0.1% on the day. As we look to the open later, Nvidia shares are now seen up only 0.6% in pre-market. Even with a triple beat on revenue, earnings, and guidance, it's not quite doing enough to drag the ship up as we gear up towards the Wall Street open in a few hours.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">And the market saying is that <em>when something can't go up on good news, it surely means that there is danger up ahead</em>.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">That being said, it would be remiss of me not to point out that investors tend to put Nvidia up on an extremely high pedestal when it comes to earnings releases. And this time is no exception to that.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">When perfection is the bare minimum, Nvidia's latest earnings beat is pretty much what investors would really want to see with the poster boy of the AI rally. So when perfection is very much expected, the exemplary tends to become ordinary. And one can argue that is what we're seeing here.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">All that being said, the more tepid mood belies the fact that the S&amp;P 500 is still just 0.8% away from reaching fresh record highs. And the Nasdaq is also bucking the technical downside break earlier this month to climb back up to its 100-day moving average - hitting a two-week high.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">There are definitely still macro concerns with regards to geopolitics and trade, alongside software stocks still being hounded by the AI disruption. All of that is certainly going to make for more cautious steps in the short-term. But if you go by the charts alone, it certainly doesn't feel like equities are in any sense of danger.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Yet, there's still that lingering feeling that the AI disruption and Nvidia having to shoulder such a heavy weight can only go so far before a correction is due. There are growing concerns on how the hyperscalers i.e. Google, Meta, Microsoft can keep up on capex spending to support the outlook portrayed by Nvidia. And that adds to the prevailing narrative that software stocks are being heavily pushed down now by the same very AI disruption that Nvidia is powering.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Can big tech prove to be enough to do the heavy lifting if the rest of the market struggles? That might be the key juncture we're at when viewing the latest developments.</p>",

As we all know, there's baseline scenarios to just about anything. However, it doesn't mean that the actual outcome follows said baseline. And in her own semantics, Lagarde will definitely argue it that way if and when the time comes for her to leave the central bank earlier than her term dictates.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As a reminder, it is speculated that Lagarde will depart from the ECB possibly before April next year. That is to say before the French presidential elections take place.

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oil prices stabilized after last week’s sharp surge, which was driven by\nfears of a possible military escalation over the weekend. Attention is now\nturning to the third round of US–Iran nuclear talks taking place in Geneva\ntoday. Based on the developments so far, the prospects for an\nagreement appear slim. In fact, the signals we are getting are actually concerning.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US has reportedly built up a significant military presence in the\nMiddle East, the largest deployment in the region since the 2003 invasion of\nIraq. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has prepared a contingency plan to\nboost short-term oil production and exports if a potential US strike on Iran\nwere to disrupt crude flows from the region. At the same time, reports suggest\nthat Iran is close to finalizing a deal to purchase supersonic anti-ship\nmissiles from China, although any deployment would not be immediate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a military conflict were to break out, oil prices would likely spike\nsharply, particularly due to the risk of disruption in the Strait of Hormuz, a\ncritical chokepoint for global energy supplies. Conversely, a clear sign of US\nmilitary de-escalation or a breakthrough in negotiations between Washington and\nTehran would likely be needed for prices to retreat toward the $60 level.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, elevated geopolitical tensions are expected to keep the oil market supported.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">CRUDE OIL\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that crude oil stabilised around the 66.43 level as traders turned their\nfocus to the third round of US-Iran nuclear talks before picking a direction. We\ncan expect the sellers to continue to step in around the 66.43 resistance with\na defined risk above it to target a drop back into the 62.36 support. The\nbuyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish\nbets into the 70.50 level next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 4 hour chart, we\nhave also a mid-range support around the 64.14 level where aggressive\ndip-buyers could step in. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nbelow that level to increase the bearish bets into the 62.36 support next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, we\nhave a minor downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on this timeframe.\nThe sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline with a defined risk\nabove it to keep pushing into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break\nhigher to pile in for a rally into new highs.
