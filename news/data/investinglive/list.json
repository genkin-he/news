The market response was immediate: Block shares surged around 25% in after-hours trade after the announcement landed alongside its fourth-quarter earnings. </p><p data-start=\"1983\" data-end=\"2564\">The reason this reads as a potential “floodgates” moment is the framing. Block’s CFO Amrita Ahuja said the company is deliberately shifting how it operates “at a time when our business is accelerating,” using smaller, highly talented teams and AI to automate more work.  Dorsey went further, arguing “intelligence tools” are changing what it means to build and run a company,  and that within the next year, most companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. </p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2852\">That’s the signal investors appeared to price: not just a one-off cost cut, but a blueprint for margin expansion and faster execution if AI genuinely substitutes for a chunk of internal labour. In other words, a CEO explicitly saying the quiet part out loud, and being rewarded for it.</p><p data-start=\"2854\" data-end=\"3237\">The financial backdrop helped. Block reported adjusted EPS of 65 cents on $6.25 billion in revenue for Q4, and gross profit rose 24% to $2.87 billion.  For 2026, the company guided adjusted EPS of $3.66, ahead of the $3.22 analysts were looking for (per LSEG as cited by Reuters). </p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3726\">The trade-off is the near-term bill: Block expects $450 million to $500 million in restructuring charges, mostly in the first quarter, primarily severance/benefits plus non-cash costs tied to share vesting.  But the after-hours move suggests investors are focused on the longer-term operating model — and that’s why this could be “first of many” across tech and fintech if boards decide the market will pay up for decisive, AI-led restructures.</p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3726\">---</p><p data-start=\"1442\" data-end=\"2039\">The bigger macro read-through is that Block <s>may</s>, lets be real here, WILL be an early, unusually candid signal of a broader labour-market transition, and one markets might actively incentivise. If a high-profile company can explicitly frame layoffs as “AI replaces work” and get a +20%-plus repricing, the boardroom lesson is simple: move fast, reset the cost base, and capture operating leverage before competitors do. That dynamic risks opening the floodgates, particularly across tech, fintech, advertising, software, consulting and corporate back offices, where tasks are modular and AI tools can be deployed quickly.</p><p data-start=\"2041\" data-end=\"2567\">At the economy level, this could look like a productivity boom paired with a white-collar employment shock. Over time, higher productivity is a positive. But the transition matters: mass job losses can depress wage growth, weaken household spending and lift political pressure, especially if displaced workers struggle to move into new roles at similar pay. The near-term inflation impulse may actually be disinflationary (lower labour costs, weaker demand), even as it concentrates pain in certain industries and geographies.</p><p data-start=\"2569\" data-end=\"3032\">For policymakers, the challenge is sequencing. Central banks could face a world where inflation falls faster than expected, but growth becomes more fragile and the unemployment rate rises, complicating any “higher for longer” stance. For markets, the reflex is already visible: reward decisive AI-enabled restructuring as a path to margins and cash flow. If that continues, “AI-led layoffs” may become a recurring feature of earnings season, not a one-off shock.</p>",

The move follows what was already a strong quarterly update that underscored NVIDIA’s dominance in data centre accelerators and AI infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"1045\" data-end=\"1503\">UBS was similarly constructive. Analysts said it was “hard to see” why the stock has remained relatively flat given what they described as exceptional fundamentals. UBS pointed to stronger-than-expected revenue guidance, sustained hyperscaler demand and an order backlog that stretches into 2027. UBS also highlighted the potential for quarterly revenue to eventually approach the $100 billion mark if current AI infrastructure build-outs persist.</p><p data-start=\"1505\" data-end=\"2018\">The renewed support builds on the earnings result we covered yesterday, where NVIDIA again <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/nvidia-q4-crushes-q1-guide-tops-street-as-ai-engine-roars-20260225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">surprised to the upside</a> on both revenue and forward guidance. Data centre revenue remained the core engine, driven by accelerating deployment of next-generation AI chips and full-stack systems. <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/nvidias-huang-says-markets-misjudge-ai-threat-as-revenue-and-guidance-smash-forecasts-20260226/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">Management flagged continued strength</a> from cloud providers, enterprise AI adoption and sovereign AI investment, reinforcing the theme that AI infrastructure spending remains in a structural upcycle rather than a short-term boom.</p><p data-start=\"2020\" data-end=\"2282\">While valuation remains a point of debate, bulls argue earnings growth continues to outpace expectations. Both JPMorgan and UBS see scope for growth to re-accelerate as production constraints ease and next-generation platforms scale further into 2026 and beyond.</p><p data-start=\"2284\" data-end=\"2493\">In short, the message from the Street is clear: fundamentals remain strong, visibility is unusually long, and AI demand has yet to peak — even if the share price has paused after its outsized multi-year rally.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Dominic LeBlanc, who is the Canadian minister responsible for US-Canada trade, says that private government to government conversations on USMCA are \"not discouraging\". Regarding separate bi-lateral deals, he said there have always been bilateral arrangements between the three countries.</p><p>Sticking with the double negatives, he said he's \"not pessimistic\" about eventual bilateral sectoral arrangements with the US.</p><p>One of my big themes is trading this year was about how many things could go 'right' for Canada and if you ignore the leaders like Carney and Trump, the messages from the deputies like LeBlanc and Jamieson Greer have been positive. Once that cloud clears -- hopefully in H2 -- there should be a wave of investment in Canada around some concrete parameters and the improvements in natural resources prices.</p><p>USD/CAD is up 21 pips today but the loonie is outperforming AUD and NZD in a day that's seeing broad risk aversion. A good portion of that is due to the rally in oil prices but Canadian current account data today showed huge inflows into Canadian government bonds in Q4; the trade deficit numbers also highlighted a decent backdrop. </p><p>Zooming out, the USD/CAD chart isn't too exciting at the moment. It briefly hit a one-month high earlier this week but is back into the range. We will watch the top of that in the days ahead with Iran and tomorrow's Q4 Canadian GDP as possible swing factors.</p><p>Ultimately, this 200 pip range won't persist but indications on the broad economy in Canada and the US are mixed. Canadian housing continues to weaken but consumer spending has been strong and Canadian retailers remain upbeat. In the US, the big investments in AI don't appear to be leading to employment while deportations are disrupting part of the employment market. Rate cuts should help the US but tariff uncertainty isn't promoting investment.</p>",

There is also the thorny issue of regional proxies, which Iran formally denies.</p><p>The main signal the market continues to see is the massive US military buildup in the region. Talk is around something like 5-day massive aerial bombardment by the US and Israel. One report says Israel is being prodded to attack first as some kind of cover for US involvement. That doesn't really pass the smell test but last month the US abducted Venezuela's head of state so we're not really playing the old games anymore. </p><p>The only real question here is what capability does Iran have regarding striking back and whether the US is willing to tolerate a militarily-diminished regime staying in power. Perhaps Venezuela is instrumental here as it looks like largely business as usual after Maduro was sent to a US prison with his wife.</p><p>In any case, there isn't much value in speculating on what either Trump or the Iranian regime will do.

            "description": "<p>Nvidia put its best foot forward with a big earnings beat but it isn't enough for the market. Shares were up around 1% in the pre-market but opened lower and are now down almost 5%. The drop is spreading beyond the company and the Nasdaq is down 1.7% and it's now even hitting FX with AUD/USD quickly falling 20 pips to the lows of the day.</p><p>Shares of NVDA were trying to break above the current range but have been pulled back in and are now likely to test the lower end of the range.</p><p>Other chipmakers are also getting hit today with Broadcom down 6.7%, Micron down 5.7% and Intel down 5.2%. Other high-flying AI related trades are also seeing profit taking.</p><p>On the whole though, advancers lead decliners in the S&amp;P 500 despite a 1.1% decline including some of the beaten up software names like FICO +6% and INTU +4.8%.</p><p>The price action suggests the market is pivoting away from AI trades in general and back to real economy bets. There is also an element of short-covering, which might suggest de-grossing in general.</p><p>I would also highlight the bond market, where US 10-year yields are testing 4% again.

Without that, it's a market that has things like Walmart trading at 44x earnings.

The technology sector demonstrates resilience, while semiconductors experience notable declines. Let’s delve into the details.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>📈 Technology Sector: A Bright Spot</strong><br>The technology sector shines brightly today. <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> gains 0.86% and <strong>Oracle (ORCL)</strong> increases by 0.75%, reflecting robust investor confidence. This upward trend suggests strengthening fundamentals and positive market sentiment towards tech infrastructure stocks.</li>\n\n<li><strong>📉 Semiconductor Setback</strong><br>In contrast, semiconductors encounter challenges. <strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> slides by 2.15% and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> drops by 1.31%, painting a picture of investor caution within this crucial tech sub-sector. Industry-specific pressures and global supply chain issues may be influencing these declines.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🏦 Financial Firmness</strong><br>The financial sector holds firm, with <strong>JPMorgan Chase (JPM)</strong> up by 0.89% and <strong>Visa (V)</strong> rising 0.52%. This stability may be attributed to positive economic outlooks and a resilient banking infrastructure supporting investor sentiments.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🚗 From Consumer Cyclical to Defensives</strong><br>The consumer cyclical landscape offers mixed signals; while <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is marginally down by 0.09%, consumer defensive giants such as <strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> enjoy a 0.59% increase, hinting at a strategic shift towards safer, defensive investments amid market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Market Mood and Trends: Navigating the Mixed Signals</h2>\n<p>The market sentiment today is marked by sector-specific dynamics. While tech infrastructure stocks reflect positive trends driven by innovation and robust earnings, semiconductors face headwinds likely due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain worries.</p>\n<p>Investors appear cautious but hopeful, pivoting towards defensives as a hedge against market uncertainties. This suggests a strategic shift to mitigate potential risks in historically volatile sectors.</p>\n\n<h2>Strategic Recommendations: Navigating the Patchwork</h2>\n<p>Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to encompass a balanced mix of technology infrastructure and defensive sectors. Given the current pulse of the semiconductor market, staying vigilant on global news and sector reports will be prudent.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider increasing exposure in technology infrastructure stocks like MSFT and ORCL.</li>\n<li>Cautiously evaluate semiconductor investments until clearer signals emerge.</li>\n<li>Explore defensive stocks for portfolio stability, especially in consumer goods like WMT and PG.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stay informed with real-time data and analyses at <a href=\"https://www.investinglive.com\">InvestingLive.com</a> to guide your investment strategies in such a dynamic market environment.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">NVIDIA delivered a monster Q4, posting record revenue of $68.1 billion — comfortably ahead of the $66.2 billion consensus estimate — with earnings of $1.62 per share (non-GAAP). Revenue surged 73% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by the data center juggernaut, which pulled in $62.3 billion and now accounts for 91% of total sales.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But the real headline was guidance. NVIDIA expects Q1 revenue of $78 billion (±2%), blowing past the $72.6 billion consensus and marking what would be the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Jensen Huang talked up the \"agentic AI inflection point\" and touted Blackwell as delivering an order-of-magnitude lower cost per token for inference workloads.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Yet the stock is up barely 1% in pre-market. That tells you everything about where the market's head is at right now — and looming large is what happened last quarter. After NVIDIA's Q3 report in November, shares spiked 4% in the initial after-hours reaction on another beat-and-raise, only to reverse and finish the following session 2% lower. Traders got burned chasing that move, and the memory of it is keeping a lid on enthusiasm this time around.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The broader debate has moved past whether NVIDIA can hit its numbers — it clearly can — and toward whether the hyperscaler capex cycle is sustainable. The big cloud players have seen more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps since early February on exactly those fears. AMD got punished 17% despite beating expectations.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The question is whether NVDA's customers can turn their huge investments into chips into revenues and profits (and free cash flow) of their own, and whether the market is willing to wait years for that to unfold.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On the face of it though, the numbers are astonishing: Full-year revenue hit $215.9 billion, up 65%. Gross margins held up at 75% for the quarter. NVIDIA returned $41.1 billion to shareholders in FY26 (though much of that was eaten up by share-based comp).</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The numbers are pristine. The question is whether the market is ready to pay up for them when the macro AI narrative is under pressure — and whether this time, the post-earnings fade finally breaks.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In terms of the chart, it looks good to me as it tries to break out of the recent consolidation ahead of a fresh test of $212. One thing that lingers is a recent Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/mega-cap-tech-most-under-owned-in-17-years-says-morgan-stanley-20260219/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">report </a>saying that Nvidia is the most under-owned large-cap tech stock among institutional investors. Now could be the moment they pile in.</p>",
