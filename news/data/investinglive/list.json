Regarding separate bi-lateral deals, he said there have always been bilateral arrangements between the three countries.</p><p>Sticking with the double negatives, he said he's \"not pessimistic\" about eventual bilateral sectoral arrangements with the US.</p><p>One of my big themes is trading this year was about how many things could go 'right' for Canada and if you ignore the leaders like Carney and Trump, the messages from the deputies like LeBlanc and Jamieson Greer have been positive. Once that cloud clears -- hopefully in H2 -- there should be a wave of investment in Canada around some concrete parameters and the improvements in natural resources prices.</p><p>USD/CAD is up 21 pips today but the loonie is outperforming AUD and NZD in a day that's seeing broad risk aversion. A good portion of that is due to the rally in oil prices but Canadian current account data today showed huge inflows into Canadian government bonds in Q4; the trade deficit numbers also highlighted a decent backdrop. </p><p>Zooming out, the USD/CAD chart isn't too exciting at the moment. It briefly hit a one-month high earlier this week but is back into the range. We will watch the top of that in the days ahead with Iran and tomorrow's Q4 Canadian GDP as possible swing factors.</p><p>Ultimately, this 200 pip range won't persist but indications on the broad economy in Canada and the US are mixed. Canadian housing continues to weaken but consumer spending has been strong and Canadian retailers remain upbeat. In the US, the big investments in AI don't appear to be leading to employment while deportations are disrupting part of the employment market. Rate cuts should help the US but tariff uncertainty isn't promoting investment.</p>",

It was lower earlier on some profit taking ahead of talks but since the talks ended, it's been one-way traffic higher.</p><p>Reports continue to highlight that the US has taken minimalist positions, including a reversal of conventional missile production,  exporting enriched uranium out of the country and destroying nuclear (or not?) sites. There is also the thorny issue of regional proxies, which Iran formally denies.</p><p>The main signal the market continues to see is the massive US military buildup in the region. Talk is around something like 5-day massive aerial bombardment by the US and Israel. One report says Israel is being prodded to attack first as some kind of cover for US involvement. That doesn't really pass the smell test but last month the US abducted Venezuela's head of state so we're not really playing the old games anymore. </p><p>The only real question here is what capability does Iran have regarding striking back and whether the US is willing to tolerate a militarily-diminished regime staying in power. Perhaps Venezuela is instrumental here as it looks like largely business as usual after Maduro was sent to a US prison with his wife.</p><p>In any case, there isn't much value in speculating on what either Trump or the Iranian regime will do. It's all wait-and-see at this point but the long history of geopolitical trades on oil almost always favors a 'sell the fact' stance as conflicts are rarely as long or intense as the fears about them. Moreover, no one has much incentive to destroy oil infrastructure. </p><p>In terms of the technicals, a break of $67.28 would be the best level since July.</p>",

The technology sector demonstrates resilience, while semiconductors experience notable declines. Let’s delve into the details.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>📈 Technology Sector: A Bright Spot</strong><br>The technology sector shines brightly today. <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> gains 0.86% and <strong>Oracle (ORCL)</strong> increases by 0.75%, reflecting robust investor confidence. This upward trend suggests strengthening fundamentals and positive market sentiment towards tech infrastructure stocks.</li>\n\n<li><strong>📉 Semiconductor Setback</strong><br>In contrast, semiconductors encounter challenges. <strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> slides by 2.15% and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> drops by 1.31%, painting a picture of investor caution within this crucial tech sub-sector. Industry-specific pressures and global supply chain issues may be influencing these declines.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🏦 Financial Firmness</strong><br>The financial sector holds firm, with <strong>JPMorgan Chase (JPM)</strong> up by 0.89% and <strong>Visa (V)</strong> rising 0.52%. This stability may be attributed to positive economic outlooks and a resilient banking infrastructure supporting investor sentiments.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🚗 From Consumer Cyclical to Defensives</strong><br>The consumer cyclical landscape offers mixed signals; while <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is marginally down by 0.09%, consumer defensive giants such as <strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> enjoy a 0.59% increase, hinting at a strategic shift towards safer, defensive investments amid market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Market Mood and Trends: Navigating the Mixed Signals</h2>\n<p>The market sentiment today is marked by sector-specific dynamics. While tech infrastructure stocks reflect positive trends driven by innovation and robust earnings, semiconductors face headwinds likely due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain worries.</p>\n<p>Investors appear cautious but hopeful, pivoting towards defensives as a hedge against market uncertainties. This suggests a strategic shift to mitigate potential risks in historically volatile sectors.</p>\n\n<h2>Strategic Recommendations: Navigating the Patchwork</h2>\n<p>Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to encompass a balanced mix of technology infrastructure and defensive sectors. Given the current pulse of the semiconductor market, staying vigilant on global news and sector reports will be prudent.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider increasing exposure in technology infrastructure stocks like MSFT and ORCL.</li>\n<li>Cautiously evaluate semiconductor investments until clearer signals emerge.</li>\n<li>Explore defensive stocks for portfolio stability, especially in consumer goods like WMT and PG.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stay informed with real-time data and analyses at <a href=\"https://www.investinglive.com\">InvestingLive.com</a> to guide your investment strategies in such a dynamic market environment.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">NVIDIA delivered a monster Q4, posting record revenue of $68.1 billion — comfortably ahead of the $66.2 billion consensus estimate — with earnings of $1.62 per share (non-GAAP). Revenue surged 73% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by the data center juggernaut, which pulled in $62.3 billion and now accounts for 91% of total sales.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But the real headline was guidance. NVIDIA expects Q1 revenue of $78 billion (±2%), blowing past the $72.6 billion consensus and marking what would be the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Jensen Huang talked up the \"agentic AI inflection point\" and touted Blackwell as delivering an order-of-magnitude lower cost per token for inference workloads.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Yet the stock is up barely 1% in pre-market. That tells you everything about where the market's head is at right now — and looming large is what happened last quarter. After NVIDIA's Q3 report in November, shares spiked 4% in the initial after-hours reaction on another beat-and-raise, only to reverse and finish the following session 2% lower. Traders got burned chasing that move, and the memory of it is keeping a lid on enthusiasm this time around.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The broader debate has moved past whether NVIDIA can hit its numbers — it clearly can — and toward whether the hyperscaler capex cycle is sustainable. The big cloud players have seen more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps since early February on exactly those fears. AMD got punished 17% despite beating expectations.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The question is whether NVDA's customers can turn their huge investments into chips into revenues and profits (and free cash flow) of their own, and whether the market is willing to wait years for that to unfold.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On the face of it though, the numbers are astonishing: Full-year revenue hit $215.9 billion, up 65%. Gross margins held up at 75% for the quarter. NVIDIA returned $41.1 billion to shareholders in FY26 (though much of that was eaten up by share-based comp).</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The numbers are pristine. The question is whether the market is ready to pay up for them when the macro AI narrative is under pressure — and whether this time, the post-earnings fade finally breaks.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In terms of the chart, it looks good to me as it tries to break out of the recent consolidation ahead of a fresh test of $212. One thing that lingers is a recent Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/mega-cap-tech-most-under-owned-in-17-years-says-morgan-stanley-20260219/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">report </a>saying that Nvidia is the most under-owned large-cap tech stock among institutional investors. Now could be the moment they pile in.</p>",
