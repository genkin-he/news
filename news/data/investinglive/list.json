            "title": "The Importance Of Crypto Literacy In 2025",
            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrency has moved from the domain of coders to determining the future of retirement funds, corporate payments, and finance in general. Yet most people don’t know what a blockchain is or why scammers want your seed phrase. Fast forward to 2025, and the distinction between wallets and exchanges, an understanding of “tokenomics,” and regulatory awareness allow the average user to look out for their own interests and identify opportunities in a market driven by hype.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Role of Crypto Literacy Today</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto rails can open new opportunities for payments, remittances, and savings, particularly where traditional banking is costly or not offered at all. You no longer need a bank to send money home, save for the future, or start a business. You just need a smartphone. For millions of people, that’s a shift in thegame.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is still a hotbed for scams, be it phishing texts, false “support” accounts, or an all-of-the-sudden “rug pull” where a token disappears post social media pump. Private key compromises accounted for the largest share (43.8%) of stolen crypto. Literacy means recognizing the red flags before you lose your money.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Gone are the days when you could simply follow the latest trending coin. Today, it’s critical for everyone, rather than just day traders, to understand how trading fees function, what assets are being locked, and how to use a blockchain explorer. For example, when new tokens launch on major exchanges, some traders jump in without checking fundamentals, leading to potential losses. That’s why it’s important to consult reliable sources, such as these <a href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/new-binance-listings/\">best Binance new listings</a>, which provide verified information on newly listed tokens and their details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Major changes are underway in crypto regulation. The GENIUS Act now requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets, while the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is reshaping how the SEC and CFTC oversee digital assets. These developments highlight why crypto users must stay informed.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Policy and Corporate Adoption: More Choice, More Risk</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Retirement Policy:</strong><br>The White House signed an order on August 7, 2025, allowing 401K access to crypto and nontraditional assets. Proponents say it’s a boon for diversification, while detractors worry about increased fees, legal hassles, and dangerous volatility. Where both sides are correct: Americans need legitimate crypto education before changing their retirement plan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Market Moves:</strong><br>This month, policy tailwinds and regulatory headwinds have sent bitcoin prices soaring to new all-time highs, but there are reasons why the bull market shouldn’t result in a bulls-only mentality. Savers who do not understand the risks of volatility, liquidity traps, and custody quirks will chase returns and end in regret.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Corporate Adoption:</strong><br>Tesla is noted for its back-and-forth crypto policies. The company briefly accepted bitcoin as payment for cars before reversing this decision 49 days later. However, you can still <a href=\"https://cryptoprocessing.com/learn/who-accepts-dogecoin\">purchase Tesla merch using Dogecoin</a>. Companies change policies rapidly, and verifying and double-checking has become a necessary skill.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges That Raise the Stakes</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most fundamental problems regarding crypto is a lack of knowledge. Many users do not fully understand private keys, seed phrases, or even wallet security at a high level, and keep their funds on exchanges, ceding control and risking losing them if the company collapses. The regulatory environment is also fragmented as law depends on the state or country. The hype by these “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-025-00947-1\">crypto influencers</a>” is questionable and can mislead newcomers. Fact-checking and source-checking are critical. Those looking to venture into crypto need to have an understanding of volatility, fees, and custody prior to converting long-term savings into crypto or any other volatile assets.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Building Your Crypto Knowledge: The Essentials</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">1.      Wallets &amp; Keys: Know the difference between “hot” online wallets and “cold” hardware storage. Never share your seed phrase; not even with customer support.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2.      Exchanges: Learn how centralized exchanges handle withdrawals, charge fees, and what liquidity “depth” means for your order size.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3.      Tokenomics &amp; Events: Emissions, vesting schedules, governance votes, and major exchange listings can all change asset value overnight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4.      Security: Recognize common scams - phishing messages, fake websites, and malicious contract approvals. Revoke permissions when in doubt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5.      Regulatory Changes: Keep up with U.S. policy on retirement accounts, IRS rules, and make sure your broker provides plain-English disclosures.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6.      Begin with government publications, policies (rather than headlines or social media), and look for coverage in non-partisan, neutral news sources for any market-moving news.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Way Forward: Access With Education</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">New crypto alternatives should have resources and guides that clearly explain them. Concepts such as wallets, custody, and market structure should be taught in personal finance education. Resources should provide concise overviews of risks, fees, and custody, with disclosures matching the protections offered to experienced investors in traditional investments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is more mainstream, but having access is not enough. Literacy is what prevents investors from unnecessary losses. Only invest what you understand, be curious, learn the basics, and inquire. This is the appropriate kind of digital financial safeguard these days, overall responsible participation.</p>",

            "description": "<h1 data-start=\"220\" data-end=\"290\">Stock earnings yesterday, insights you don’t see on the price charts, and an Amazon slam dunk</h1><p data-start=\"292\" data-end=\"412\"><strong>Hi investors and traders at investingLive.com, here is a beginner friendly snapshot </strong>of stock earnings yesterday. See which companies moved more or less than expected, why priced in means size not direction, and how to read the reactions with confidence. And if you're a pro, you're still likely to appreciate the analysis we've cooked up for you. Let's dive in...</p><h2 data-start=\"739\" data-end=\"774\">Yesterday’s Earnings at a Glance</h2><p data-start=\"776\" data-end=\"988\">Sixteen S&amp;P 500 companies reported results. Half rose and half fell. On average the group barely moved. That tells us the market had already prepared for most of what came out. In other words many results were priced in.</p><p data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1142\"><strong data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1008\">Plain English:</strong> priced in is about how big the move might be. It does not say which way. The options market sets an expected move for up or for down.</p><h2 data-start=\"1144\" data-end=\"1191\">Standouts. Actual Move Next to Expected Move</h2><p data-start=\"1193\" data-end=\"1296\">Putting the actual move right next to the expected move helps beginners see reality versus preparation.</p><ul data-start=\"1298\" data-end=\"1570\"><li data-start=\"1298\" data-end=\"1352\"><p data-start=\"1300\" data-end=\"1352\"><strong data-start=\"1300\" data-end=\"1316\">Amazon AMZN:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1317\" data-end=\"1350\">+13.2% vs about 5.9% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1353\" data-end=\"1405\"><p data-start=\"1355\" data-end=\"1405\"><strong data-start=\"1355\" data-end=\"1370\">Apple AAPL:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1371\" data-end=\"1403\">+2.3% vs about 3.3% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1406\" data-end=\"1468\"><p data-start=\"1408\" data-end=\"1468\"><strong data-start=\"1408\" data-end=\"1432\">Cardinal Health CAH:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1433\" data-end=\"1466\">+15.4% vs about 4.5% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1469\" data-end=\"1520\"><p data-start=\"1471\" data-end=\"1520\"><strong data-start=\"1471\" data-end=\"1484\">Cigna CI:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1485\" data-end=\"1518\">−17.4% vs about 5.2% expected</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"1521\" data-end=\"1570\"><p data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1570\"><strong data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1537\">Altria MO:</strong> <strong data-start=\"1538\" data-end=\"1570\">−7.8% vs about 3.5% expected</strong></p></li></ul><p data-start=\"1572\" data-end=\"1699\">So a few names made big moves. Many others were quiet. Two very large companies carried most of the positive headline.</p><h2 data-start=\"1701\" data-end=\"1743\">Surprise Share. Quiet Tape or Live Wire</h2><p data-start=\"1745\" data-end=\"2019\">About four in ten companies moved more than their expected move. That is meaningful for the first trading window. Option prices usually include a safety cushion. Many options also cover more than a single session. Seeing that much exceed the mark right away is worth noting.</p><p data-start=\"2021\" data-end=\"2211\"><strong data-start=\"2021\" data-end=\"2042\">New investor tip:</strong> if a stock moves less than expected, option buyers may have paid for protection they did not end up needing. If a stock moves more than expected, that protection helps.</p><h2 data-start=\"2213\" data-end=\"2286\">Concentration Watch. Why the Headline Looked Stronger Than the Average</h2><p data-start=\"2288\" data-end=\"2480\">Two mega caps did most of the lifting: Amazon, mainly, and some more minor support from Apple (will the Apple positive move hold today? Mmm... that would be interesting to watch, mayb not for long... See below). </p><p data-start=\"2288\" data-end=\"2480\">This can make the headline look healthy even when the middle of the pack is mixed. It is common in modern indexes and it matters for portfolio decisions.</p><p data-start=\"2482\" data-end=\"2650\"><strong data-start=\"2482\" data-end=\"2512\">What you can do with this:</strong> do not chase the headline alone. Look for steady names that held up beneath the surface. Calm days can still hide a change in leadership.</p><h2 data-start=\"2652\" data-end=\"2711\">Stock Earnings Yesterday. What New Investors Can Do Next</h2><ul data-start=\"2713\" data-end=\"3151\"><li data-start=\"2713\" data-end=\"2809\"><p data-start=\"2715\" data-end=\"2809\">No broad breakout detected. Many companies matched what the market had already prepared for.</p></li><li data-start=\"2810\" data-end=\"2881\"><p data-start=\"2812\" data-end=\"2881\">Watch for concentration. A strong headline can hide a flat average.</p></li><li data-start=\"2882\" data-end=\"2994\"><p data-start=\"2884\" data-end=\"2994\">Remember that the expected move is direction neutral. It describes the size of the swing. Not the direction.</p></li><li data-start=\"2995\" data-end=\"3151\"><p data-start=\"2997\" data-end=\"3151\">Options note. Smaller than expected moves often mean a comfort premium stayed with sellers. Larger than expected moves reward those who bought protection.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"3153\" data-end=\"3185\">Earnings Basics for Beginners</h2><ul data-start=\"3187\" data-end=\"3372\"><li data-start=\"3187\" data-end=\"3296\"><p data-start=\"3189\" data-end=\"3296\"><strong data-start=\"3189\" data-end=\"3207\">Expected move:</strong> the options based estimate of how big a stock might swing around earnings. Up or down.</p></li><li data-start=\"3297\" data-end=\"3372\"><p data-start=\"3299\" data-end=\"3372\"><strong data-start=\"3299\" data-end=\"3313\">Priced in:</strong> means size was anticipated. It does not predict direction.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"3374\" data-end=\"3405\">Yesterday’s One Line Earnings Snapshot</h2><p data-start=\"3407\" data-end=\"3460\">Stable overall. A few punchy movers carried the tape. With Amazon winning yesterday' earnings slam dunk competition (a wink to its <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sports/nba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">cooperation with the NBA</a>, and who doesn't like the NBA, right?)</p>",

The core-core measure (excluding both food and energy) also climbed 2.8%, underscoring persistent price pressures.</p><p data-start=\"711\" data-end=\"930\">The gains were driven mainly by higher food costs — including a 38% jump in rice prices — while service-sector inflation remained modest at 1.6%, suggesting firms are still slow to pass on rising labour costs.</p><p data-start=\"932\" data-end=\"1123\">Elsewhere, industrial output and jobless data were encouraging (see details above).
