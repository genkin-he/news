            "title": "Weekend risk could keep a lid on the Nasdaq as US-Iran tensions persist. What's next?",
            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p>The Nasdaq sold off\nyesterday after early reports suggested the third round of US–Iran talks had\nbroken down, with Iran reportedly rejecting US demands. Later in the day,\nhowever, new headlines indicated that the discussions had actually made\nsignificant progress and that another round was scheduled for next week. This\nkind of back-and-forth on the macro and geopolitical front is keeping most\nmarkets rangebound.</p><p>Right now, the main risks\nfor the Nasdaq are a potential US–Iran military escalation and a hawkish\nrepricing of Fed interest rate expectations.</p><p>On the rates side, the\nmarket is still pricing in about 57 bps of easing by year-end. This outlook could\nbe at risk of a hawkish repricing on further improvement in the US labour\nmarket data. In fact, Fed Governor Waller said that he would consider holding\nrates steady if we see another strong NFP report like January’s. That makes\nnext Friday’s data especially important as solid numbers could weigh on\nequities in the short term as traders dial back expectations for rate cuts.</p><p>The bigger risk, though, is\ngeopolitical. If a military conflict between the US and Iran were to break out,\noil prices would likely surge. That would represent a negative shock to the\nglobal economy and raise stagflation concerns. The initial market reaction\nwould almost certainly be a sharp move toward risk aversion, with equities\nselling off hard as growth expectations deteriorate. </p><p>To sum up, there are lots\nof downside risks at the moment with little reasons for a rally into new\nall-time highs. The macro backdrop remains broadly supportive, with easing\ninflation and a resilient labour market, but that picture could shift quickly. Traders\nwill need to stay nimble. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">NASDAQ TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe daily chart, we can see the\nNasdaq has been trading in a wide range\nsince October of last year. Such long consolidations generally lead to big\ntrending moves once the price breaks out. Until then, the market participants\nwill continue to play the range. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">NASDAQ TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe 4 hour chart, we got a\nbreakout of the 24,700-25,127 range on Wednesday, but all the gains were eventually\npared back yesterday on the US-Iran tensions. We now have an upward trendline defining\nthe bullish structure on this timeframe. The buyers will likely lean on the\ntrendline with a defined risk below the 24,700 support to keep pushing into new\nhighs, while the sellers will look for a break below the trendline and the\nsupport to increase the bearish bets into the 24,200 level next. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">NASDAQ TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup\naround the trendline and the 24,700 support, but another break above the 25,127\ncould see the buyers piling in for a move back into the 25,500 level. The\nsellers, on the other hand, will likely step in around the 25,127 level with a\ndefined risk above it to position for a break below the trendline. The red\nlines define the <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/\">average daily range</a> for today. </p><h2>UPCOMING CATALYSTS</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://investinglive.com/EconomicCalendar\">Today</a> we conclude the week with the US PPI report but continue to watch\nout for US-Iran headlines.</p>",

Yesterday,\nit looked like the third round of US-Iran talks went bad as we got reports of\nIran rejecting US demands. The markets went into risk-off, eventually\nsupporting gold prices. </p><p>Later on, we got reports\nthat the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-iran-nuclear-talks-resume-geneva-against-backdrop-military-threat-2026-02-26/\">talks\nmade significant progress</a> and another round was scheduled for next week. This\npush and pull is keeping most market rangebound, including gold. </p><p>Overall, the market might\nremain supported in the short-term amid some uncertainty, but I don’t see\nmaterial changes to justify a rally back to all-time highs, at the moment. The\nreal risks remain a potential US-Iran military escalation which could take gold\nprices to new highs or a hawkish repricing on stronger US data which would have\na negative effect on the market. </p><p>Fed’s Waller mentioned that\nhe would change his dovish stance in case the strong January’s jobs data is\nrepeated in February, so next week’s NFP report is going to be a key risk event\nfor gold. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">GOLD TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that gold is creeping higher, but the momentum remains weak with many\nconsolidations along the way.

From a risk management perspective, the buyers\nwill have better risk to reward opportunities around the 5100 support and the\nminor upward trendline to position for a rally into new all-time highs. The\nsellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price breaking below the\ntrendline to open the door for a drop back into the 4600 level next.</p><h2>GOLD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 1\nHOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will likely continue to step in around the\nsupport and the trendline, while the sellers will wait for the break of the\ntrendline to gain more conviction for new lows.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">UK political developments are looking set to return into the picture, especially with the latest happening in Manchester. The Gorton and Denton by-election saw a rather seismic result, with Labour losing a seat that they have held for nearly a century.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">For some context, the by-election was triggered after MP Andrew Gwynne resigned due to \"significant ill health\". He was sitting as an independent after having been suspended by the Labour party.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Starmer has already seen his support and popularity dwindle immensely and he grew even more unpopular in blocking Andy Burnham from running as the Labour candidate for the by-election. This was because Burnham looks to be deemed as a threat to Starmer, in trying to use this bid as a passage back to Westminster. Oof.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In any case, the results were rather damning:</p><ul><li>Green (Hannah Spencer) - 40.6% (<strong>+27.4% swing</strong>)</li><li>Reform (Matt Goodwin) - 28.7% (<strong>+14.6% swing</strong>)</li><li>Labour (Angeliki Stogia) - 25.4% (<strong>-25.4% swing</strong>)</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Yes, Labour didn't even finish second in a seat that they claimed a majority less than two years ago. It's pretty much a collapse and this is akin to a referendum on Starmer's leadership basically. Is this the tipping point for Starmer? Time will tell but it potentially could be.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As political instability and a more messy political scene domestically starts to come back into the picture, the pound might find itself in a bit of trouble up ahead. That especially as UK economic conditions have been flagging at best in recent months.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Now, Starmer isn't going to resign and put things in chaos. However, a leadership transition looks to be in order at some point. So, it's best to be prepared for that.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Since hitting highs of around 1.3850 in late January, GBP/USD has struggled to keep afloat and is down 1.5% in February. That effectively also erases the gains seen in January more or less.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">And from the charts, we are moving towards a critical juncture with the pair now inching closer again towards a test of its 200-day moving average (blue line). Hold above that and the bias keeps more bullish for the pair. But break below that, and the bias shifts to being more neutral with eyes on key support at the 100-day moving average (red line) next.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Looking ahead, there's two ways to look at this. A leadership transition and political instability might see the BOE want to maintain order and keep monetary policy steady. That so as not to shake things up all too much.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">However, just be reminded that their mandate remains more focused on inflation and the economy. If the latter continues to struggle further this year with price pressures not exactly worsening and showing mild signs of easing (still not as much as hoped though), that might be enough to trigger the BOE to act regardless.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">That especially since a messier political scene will weigh on business and overseas investments to the UK. Hence, that will also weigh on economic output as things trickle down.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">At the balance, I'd wager the more chaotic political scene would be a net negative for the pound in the short-term. So, that will be a key factor to consider for the currency outlook as we get into the weeks/months ahead.</p>",

We will also get the French and Spanish inflation figures, but the German data is generally more market-moving because it carries more weight in the Eurozone CPI calculations. The German CPI Y/Y is expected at 2.0% vs 2.1% prior.</p><p>We also have the French and Swiss Q4 GDP reports, but these will be the final readings, so they won't be market-moving and won't change anything for the respective central banks. </p><h2>AMERICAN SESSION</h2><p>In the American session, the focus will turn to the Canadian GDP and the US PPI. The Canadian GDP for December is expected at 0.1% vs 0.0% prior. The data is very unlikely to change anything for the BoC at this point as the central bank wait for more recent data and especially the USMCA developments. </p><p>The US PPI Y/Y is expected at 2.6% vs 3.0% prior, while the Core PPI Y/Y is seen at 3.0% vs 3.3% prior. Several of PPI specific sub-components feed into PCE calculations, so we will get more precise PCE forecasts after the data. Right now, analysts see the Core PCE in January to have risen around 0.3% due to stubborn service-sector costs.</p><h2>CENTRAL BANK SPEAKERS</h2><ul><li>13:00 GMT/08:00 ET - BoE's Pill (hawkish - voter)</li></ul>",

The expiries keep nearby the confluence of the key hourly moving averages, seen at 1.1795-00 currently.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">German inflation remains one of, if not the key sticking point for the ECB in trying to sort out monetary policy setting. Price pressures in Europe's largest economy hasn't dropped off enough to allow for the central bank to take more steps in lowering interest rates further. And late last year, there were still stagflation concerns for the most part.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">On that final point, a lot of the fears have been allayed in the past two months at least. The German economy has held up well with a notable recovery in the manufacturing sector especially. Adding to that, we are seeing price pressures ease back slightly as well. That being said, German core annual inflation continues to keep well above the 2% threshold.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The January reading saw core prices stick at 2.5%, with services inflation once again staying rather stubborn. Service prices were seen up 3.2% compared to the same month a year ago, rising at an above-average rate still. As such, that's keeping policymakers on their toes and alongside a somewhat similar picture in Spain is putting the central bank on the sidelines currently.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Looking to the February estimates, German headline inflation is expected to keep thereabouts again as in January. Headline annual inflation is estimated at 2.0%, marginally lower from the 2.1% reading last month. The EU-harmonised estimate is expected to be the same at 2.1%.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">But again, all eyes will be on the core annual inflation estimate. And that will be the one that will matter most when viewing the report today.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Besides that, just be wary of the monthly figures with it expected to show another increase of 0.5% in January. If realised, that will mark the biggest monthly jump in headline prices since April 2024.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Here's the agenda for today:</p><ul class=\"text-align-start vertical-align-baseline\"><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - North Rhine Westphalia</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Hesse</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Bavaria</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Baden Wuerttemberg</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Saxony</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">1300 GMT - Germany national preliminary figures</strong></li></ul><p class=\"vertical-align-baseline text-align-justify\">Do note that the releases don't exactly follow the schedule at times and may be released a little earlier or later.</p>",

The core-core measure, which strips out fresh food and energy, continued to track above 2%, broadly consistent with the BOJ’s guidance that inflation would temporarily slow before reaccelerating on steady wage gains.</p><p data-start=\"957\" data-end=\"1186\">The yen traded in a subdued range session, mirroring broader calm across major FX pairs. </p><p data-start=\"1188\" data-end=\"1637\">The Chinese yuan, however, was more active. The People’s Bank of China cut the FX risk reserve ratio to 0%, reversing a tool previously used to support the currency. Raising the ratio makes it more expensive to short the RMB via forwards, while today’s move removes some of that support at the margin. By lowering hedging costs, the decision may encourage greater forward activity and modestly trim appreciation pressure, prompting the yuan to ease. In another move the Bank set the refernce rate more than 800 points away from the modelled estimate, a record wide gap. </p><p data-start=\"1188\" data-end=\"1637\">In corporate news, Block announced it will cut more than 4,000 roles, reducing headcount from over 10,000 to just under 6,000.

Investors welcomed the restructuring alongside earnings, sending shares roughly 25% higher after hours.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2171\">Meanwhile, Netflix said it would not raise its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, effectively clearing the way for Paramount Skydance’s revised bid. Netflix shares rallied on the decision.</p><p data-start=\"2173\" data-end=\"2464\">Geopolitical tensions intensified.

The comments underscore officials’ sensitivity to yen weakness as a cost-of-living issue, particularly via import prices, at a time when politics, fiscal policy and central-bank messaging are pulling in different directions.</p><p data-start=\"1553\" data-end=\"2058\">The political backdrop is doing the yen no favours. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, fresh off a strong election mandate, has pitched a shift away from fiscal austerity, including multi-year investment plans and tax-relief proposals aimed at lifting growth. While framed as pro-growth, the agenda has revived concerns about Japan’s already heavy debt load, and, by extension, higher term premia and a weaker currency if investors demand more compensation to hold JGBs. </p><p data-start=\"2060\" data-end=\"2418\">Monetary policy has become the other flashpoint. <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/forex/the-japanese-yen-sinks-as-pm-takaichi-signals-opposition-to-further-boj-rate-hikes-20260224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">Takaichi has been reported as wary of additional BOJ rate hikes</a>, and her government’s nomination of two likely dovish-leaning academics to the BOJ policy board was read by markets as an attempt to tilt the debate toward a slower normalisation path. The yen weakened on the news. </p><p data-start=\"2420\" data-end=\"3046\">Yet the BOJ’s internal messaging remains split rather than uniformly dovish. Board member Hajime Takata, widely seen as one of the most hawkish voices, reiterated that policymakers should stay alert to inflation overshoot risks and continue gradual hikes.  Meanwhile, Tokyo’s February inflation data delivered a mixed signal: core inflation (ex fresh food) slipped to 1.8% but the “core-core” gauge (ex fresh food and energy) ticked up to 2.5%, broadly consistent with the BOJ’s view that any slowdown is temporary due to subsidies and base effects. </p><p data-start=\"3048\" data-end=\"3411\">The upshot for markets is a familiar tension: officials talk tougher on FX as the yen weakens, while domestic politics leans toward easier financial conditions and the BOJ debates how quickly to tighten. That combination keeps intervention rhetoric alive, but also keeps the yen sensitive to swings in US yields and shifting expectations around the next BOJ move.</p>",

The measure reverses a September 2022 tightening that was originally introduced to stem sharp yuan depreciation and capital outflows.</p><p data-start=\"956\" data-end=\"1402\">By removing the reserve requirement, effectively a “speed bump” on forward dollar purchases, the PBOC has<a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/usdcny-usdcnh-jump-as-pboc-cuts-fx-rrr-to-zero-cooling-yuan-gains-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\"> lowered the cost of shorting the yuan</a> and buying dollars via forwards. While officials framed the decision as supporting enterprises in managing exchange-rate risks, the timing suggests policymakers are also keen to temper one-way appreciation pressure after the currency recently climbed to near three-year highs against a softer dollar.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1672\">In a further signal, the <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/pboc-sets-usd-cny-reference-rate-for-today-at-69228-vs-estimate-at-68428-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">PBOC held the daily USD/CNY midpoint at 6.922</a>8, resisting expectations for another fresh 33-month low. The steady fix, combined with stronger USD-positive damping, is seen as establishing a near-term floor around Thursday’s trough near 6.8310.</p><p data-start=\"1674\" data-end=\"1952\">The immediate market response saw USD/CNH rebound, with traders trimming crowded yuan-long bets. Analysts expect USD/CNY to rise moderately before stabilising in a 6.9000–6.9500 range, reflecting a policy stance aimed at smoothing gains rather than reversing direction outright.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2298\">Chart signals also point to fading downside momentum in USD/CNY. A long-tailed doji formation suggested exhaustion in the recent decline, while a break above the 6.8868 Bollinger channel ceiling would reinforce the case for a corrective bounce toward the 21-day moving average near 6.9235 and potentially toward the upper channel around 6.9560.</p><p data-start=\"2300\" data-end=\"2569\">Over the past decade, the PBOC has repeatedly adjusted the FX risk reserve ratio to manage two-way currency pressures. The latest move fits that pattern: not an attempt to weaken the yuan materially, but a calibrated step to curb excessive strength and damp volatility. </p>",

            "description": "<p>Tokyo core inflation dips below 2%, but firm underlying prices keep BOJ tightening bias intact.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li data-start=\"150\" data-end=\"206\"><p data-start=\"152\" data-end=\"206\">Tokyo February headline CPI: 1.6% y/y (exp 1.4%)</p></li><li data-start=\"207\" data-end=\"268\"><p data-start=\"209\" data-end=\"268\">Core (ex fresh food): 1.8% y/y (exp 1.7%, prior 2.0%)</p></li><li data-start=\"269\" data-end=\"344\"><p data-start=\"271\" data-end=\"344\">Core-core (ex fresh food &amp; energy): 2.5% y/y (exp 2.3%, prior 2.4%)</p></li><li data-start=\"345\" data-end=\"423\"><p data-start=\"347\" data-end=\"423\">Core inflation slips below BOJ’s 2% target for first time in 16 months</p></li><li data-start=\"424\" data-end=\"507\"><p data-start=\"426\" data-end=\"507\">Trend inflation gauge strengthens, in line with BOJ’s “temporary slowdown” view</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"531\" data-end=\"719\">Inflation in Japan’s capital moderated in February, with core prices slipping below the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for the first time in 16 months, though underlying momentum remained firm.</p><p data-start=\"721\" data-end=\"1037\">Data for Tokyo, widely viewed as a leading indicator for national inflation, showed headline CPI rose 1.6% year-on-year, above expectations of 1.4%. Core CPI, which excludes fresh food, increased 1.8% y/y, easing from 2.0% previously and dipping below the BOJ’s 2% target. Markets had expected a 1.7% rise.</p><p data-start=\"1039\" data-end=\"1276\">However, the index excluding both fresh food and energy accelerated to 2.5% y/y from 2.4%, topping forecasts of 2.3%.</p><p data-start=\"1278\" data-end=\"1587\">The moderation in core inflation largely reflects fuel subsidies and the removal of gasoline tax surcharges, alongside fading base effects from last year’s food price spike. The result aligns with the BOJ’s guidance that inflation would temporarily slow before reaccelerating on the back of steady wage gains.</p><p data-start=\"1589\" data-end=\"1907\">The print presents a nuanced test for policymakers. While the dip below 2% could embolden dovish voices within government, particularly Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who has reportedly <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/forex/japanese-yen-falls-on-report-that-takaichi-voiced-concerns-to-ueda-on-boj-rate-hikes-20260224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">expressed reservations about further rate hikes</a>, economists say the outcome alone is unlikely to derail the BOJ’s tightening bias.</p><p data-start=\"1909\" data-end=\"2157\">The central bank raised its policy rate to 0.75% in December, the highest in 30 years, as it continued its gradual exit from ultra-loose policy. Officials have maintained they will keep raising rates if economic and price forecasts materialise.</p><p data-start=\"2159\" data-end=\"2479\">Separately, factory output rose 2.2% in January, its first increase in three months, driven by double-digit car production gains. However, the rebound undershot the median forecast for a 5.3% rise, and manufacturers expect output to fall again in February and March,  underscoring fragility in the industrial sector.</p><p data-start=\"2481\" data-end=\"2685\">For now, Tokyo’s data reinforces the BOJ’s narrative: inflation is softening temporarily due to policy and base effects, but underlying price pressures remain consistent with gradual policy normalisation.</p>",

By scrapping the requirement, the PBOC effectively lowers the cost for financial institutions to purchase foreign exchange via forward contracts — making it cheaper to buy U.S. dollars and hedge currency exposure.</p><p data-start=\"1152\" data-end=\"1501\">The move comes against a markedly different backdrop from 2022. The yuan posted its strongest annual gain against the dollar since 2020 last year, breaking back through the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level, with momentum carrying into early 2026. Recent sessions saw both onshore (CNY) and offshore (CNH) yuan touch fresh 33-month highs.</p><p data-start=\"1503\" data-end=\"1901\">By cutting the FX risk reserve ratio to zero, the PBOC is removing a previous deterrent to forward-based RMB short positioning. Higher ratios raise the cost of selling the yuan via forwards, supporting the currency by increasing hedging friction. Today’s move reduces that friction, and is widely interpreted as an attempt to temper yuan appreciation rather than to stimulate depreciation outright.</p><p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2367\">The market reaction was swift. Offshore USD/CNH jumped, up around 0.3% on the session, before easing slightly. Traders viewed the change as a signal that authorities are comfortable allowing some retracement after the currency’s strong run. Notably, the PBOC kept the USD/CNY midpoint broadly unchanged from Thursday at 6.9228, with a massive <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/pboc-sets-usd-cny-reference-rate-for-today-at-69228-vs-estimate-at-68428-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">800+ difference from the model estimate, a record gap. </a></p><p data-start=\"2369\" data-end=\"2776\">Analysts said the move serves a dual purpose: improving hedging efficiency and forward-market liquidity, while also acting as a calibrated measure to cool excessive one-way appreciation pressure. By making dollar buying less expensive, policymakers are subtly rebalancing expectations without abandoning their broader commitment to keeping the renminbi “basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level.”</p><p data-start=\"2369\" data-end=\"2776\">Pan Gongsheng, People's Bank of China governor, has had enough of you buying so much yuan. </p>",
