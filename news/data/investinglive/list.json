            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 rebounded\nfrom the monthly lows as risk sentiment improved. There was no real catalyst\nfor the move as the market continues to trade in a range amid uncertainty on\nthe macro and geopolitical fronts. </p><p>The short-term uncertainty\ncaused by the US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs might have weighed on the\nmarket, but in the bigger picture it didn’t change much as Trump quickly\nreimposed new tariffs using different laws. The new levies reduce the effective\naverage tariff rate, which could be a positive at the margin. </p><p>In terms of Fed interest\nrates path, the market is still pricing 54 bps of easing by year-end which\ncould be at risk of a hawkish repricing on further improvement in the US labour\nmarket data. In fact, Fed’s Waller mentioned that he might want to hold rates\nsteady if we see a repeat of the strong January’s NFP report. Therefore, next\nFriday is going to be key as good data could weigh on the market in the\nshort-term on a hawkish repricing. </p><p>Lastly, we have the US-Iran\nmilitary escalation risk. This is one of the biggest risks because if a\nmilitary conflict were to break out, we would see oil prices skyrocket. This\nwould be a negative shock for the global economy and lead to stagflation risks.\nThe first reaction in the markets would be strong risk aversion. We would\nhighly likely see a selloff in the stock market as future growth expectations\nwould turn negative.</p><p>To sum up, there are lots\nof downside risks at the moment with little reasons for a rally into new\nall-time highs. Nonetheless, the macro backdrop remains positive given the\neasing inflation and improving labour market, but that could change quickly, so\ntraders will need to be careful.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe daily chart, we can see that\nthe S&amp;P 500 rebounded from the monthly\nlows and it’s approaching the all-time highs. If the price gets there, we can\nexpect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the record highs, to\nposition for a drop back into the 6,760 support. The buyers, on the other hand,\nwill want to see the price breaking higher to increase the bullish bets into\nnew record highs.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe 4 hour chart, we have a\nstrong support zone around the 6,930 level. If we get a pullback, we can expect\nthe buyers to step in around the support with a defined risk below it to keep\npushing into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nlower to pile back in and target the 6,760 support. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500 TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup\naround the support, while the sellers will need a break lower to open the door\nfor a drop into the 6,760 support.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">The big story in the equities market came after the close yesterday, with Nvidia delivering a major beat in their earnings report across the board. That saw shares of the tech giant rose by over 3% for a brief period in after-hours trading before settling with more modest gains. In turn, broader market sentiment also retreated and that's making for a more tepid mood seen in Asia and early European morning trade thus far.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.1% currently, with Nasdaq futures also down 0.1% on the day. As we look to the open later, Nvidia shares are now seen up only 0.6% in pre-market. Even with a triple beat on revenue, earnings, and guidance, it's not quite doing enough to drag the ship up as we gear up towards the Wall Street open in a few hours.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">And the market saying is that <em>when something can't go up on good news, it surely means that there is danger up ahead</em>.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">That being said, it would be remiss of me not to point out that investors tend to put Nvidia up on an extremely high pedestal when it comes to earnings releases. And this time is no exception to that.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">When perfection is the bare minimum, Nvidia's latest earnings beat is pretty much what investors would really want to see with the poster boy of the AI rally. So when perfection is very much expected, the exemplary tends to become ordinary. And one can argue that is what we're seeing here.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">All that being said, the more tepid mood belies the fact that the S&amp;P 500 is still just 0.8% away from reaching fresh record highs. And the Nasdaq is also bucking the technical downside break earlier this month to climb back up to its 100-day moving average - hitting a two-week high.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">There are definitely still macro concerns with regards to geopolitics and trade, alongside software stocks still being hounded by the AI disruption. All of that is certainly going to make for more cautious steps in the short-term. But if you go by the charts alone, it certainly doesn't feel like equities are in any sense of danger.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Yet, there's still that lingering feeling that the AI disruption and Nvidia having to shoulder such a heavy weight can only go so far before a correction is due. There are growing concerns on how the hyperscalers i.e. Google, Meta, Microsoft can keep up on capex spending to support the outlook portrayed by Nvidia. And that adds to the prevailing narrative that software stocks are being heavily pushed down now by the same very AI disruption that Nvidia is powering.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Can big tech prove to be enough to do the heavy lifting if the rest of the market struggles? That might be the key juncture we're at when viewing the latest developments.</p>",

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oil prices stabilized after last week’s sharp surge, which was driven by\nfears of a possible military escalation over the weekend. Attention is now\nturning to the third round of US–Iran nuclear talks taking place in Geneva\ntoday. Based on the developments so far, the prospects for an\nagreement appear slim. In fact, the signals we are getting are actually concerning.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US has reportedly built up a significant military presence in the\nMiddle East, the largest deployment in the region since the 2003 invasion of\nIraq. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has prepared a contingency plan to\nboost short-term oil production and exports if a potential US strike on Iran\nwere to disrupt crude flows from the region. At the same time, reports suggest\nthat Iran is close to finalizing a deal to purchase supersonic anti-ship\nmissiles from China, although any deployment would not be immediate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a military conflict were to break out, oil prices would likely spike\nsharply, particularly due to the risk of disruption in the Strait of Hormuz, a\ncritical chokepoint for global energy supplies. Conversely, a clear sign of US\nmilitary de-escalation or a breakthrough in negotiations between Washington and\nTehran would likely be needed for prices to retreat toward the $60 level.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, elevated geopolitical tensions are expected to keep the oil market supported.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">CRUDE OIL\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that crude oil stabilised around the 66.43 level as traders turned their\nfocus to the third round of US-Iran nuclear talks before picking a direction. We\ncan expect the sellers to continue to step in around the 66.43 resistance with\na defined risk above it to target a drop back into the 62.36 support. The\nbuyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish\nbets into the 70.50 level next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 4 hour chart, we\nhave also a mid-range support around the 64.14 level where aggressive\ndip-buyers could step in. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nbelow that level to increase the bearish bets into the 62.36 support next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, we\nhave a minor downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on this timeframe.\nThe sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline with a defined risk\nabove it to keep pushing into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break\nhigher to pile in for a rally into new highs.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">It's nice to wrap up the trading week with it being the final day of the month. And interestingly enough, did you realise that the March calendar is a repeat of February (only with the additional 3 days). In February trading, the dollar has been rather resilient after struggling towards the end of last year. However, the mood has been a bit shaky in the second half of the month.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Geopolitical uncertainty and trade policy uncertainty are two big issues that are plaguing the greenback. No thanks to the erratic policy handling by the US administration of course. And that's keeping precious metals underpinned amid the continued currency debasement narrative since last year.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for the dollar itself, that is putting the currency on the rocks as it looks vulnerable to a renewed drop heading into March. But in closing out February trading, Credit Agricole argues that the dollar could find support from month-end flows in at least holding its head above water in the final few days here.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>\"On the structural side, concerns about rebalancing out of the US remain a drag on the USD and support EUR/USD. The latest spike of US trade policy risks seems to support the bearish USD-view as FX investors shun the US policy and economic uncertainty. In addition, valuation concerns erode the appeal of USD assets.</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>That said, we also note that the more recent USD recovery has coincided with US stock market weakness. This may suggest that the USD is benefitting from the unwinding of short-USD hedges that foreign investors have put into place. <strong>Our month-end rebalancing model predicts that they will continue to buy USD this week</strong>.\"</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Just something to take note of as we move into the closing stages of the week in the next two days.

Bitcoin CME Futures are currently hovering right around <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"204\">$68,185, </strong>pulling back a bit by 1.91%, or roughly $1,330, on the day. If you're watching the charts today, the immediate range is pretty tight, you've got support holding near the daily low of <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"398\">$67,965</strong> and resistance capping things off around the session high of <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"467\">$69,195</strong>.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">But to really understand the technical setup, you have to zoom out. Sure, we’re seeing a spark of short-term momentum with a <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"125\">3.11%</strong> pop over the last week, but that little victory is fighting against a brutal longer-term downtrend. We're still down <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"249\">23%</strong> year-to-date and nursing a painful nearly <strong>40</strong>% drop over the last six months (!). </p><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">When you compare this recent weekly bounce to those heavy multi-month losses, especially considering we're miles away from the 52-week high of $127,240, it becomes obvious just how critical these current price levels are. The big question now is whether this is just a fleeting relief rally, or the actual groundwork for a real, sustained reversal.</p><h3 data-path-to-node=\"0\">Ethereum's 20% Surge Activates a Major Bull Flag — Now the Real Test Begins</h3><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">Ethereum is stealing the spotlight right now, officially outpacing Bitcoin yesteraday after an explosive rally that sent prices soaring roughly 20% since Thursday morning. Looking at the 1-hour Ether Futures chart, the technical setup is incredibly compelling: the price successfully broke out of its lengthy descending channel, decisively activating a textbook bull flag. Currently trading around the <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"392\">$2,061.0</strong> mark following a minor intraday pullback, the mission for buyers is crystal clear. Bulls absolutely must step up and defend the upper boundary of this previously broken flag, turning former resistance into new support. If they can successfully hold this line, the bullish technical narrative remains completely intact, paving the way for the market's next leg up. But bulls can not fully celebrate yet and I explain why below.</p><h2 data-start=\"557\" data-end=\"619\">The daily view: rebound energy is fading into consolidation</h2><h3 data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"672\">Bitcoin futures daily: rebound, then hesitation</h3><p data-start=\"673\" data-end=\"837\">On the daily timeframe, BTC looks like it successfully defended a downside extension, then ran into supply and began to stall. That usually means one of two things:</p><ol data-start=\"839\" data-end=\"976\"><li data-start=\"839\" data-end=\"892\"><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"892\">The market is building a base to continue higher</p></li><li data-start=\"893\" data-end=\"976\"><p data-start=\"896\" data-end=\"976\">The rebound was mostly short-covering and it will fade once buyers stop pressing</p></li></ol><p data-start=\"978\" data-end=\"1135\">The key daily takeaway is simple: the bounce happened, but the market still needs proof that it can reclaim and hold higher prices rather than just tag them.</p><h3 data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1200\">Ether futures daily: similar story, slightly weaker posture</h3><p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1547\">ETH is in the same “rebound then pause” regime, but with a slightly more fragile feel because it is repeatedly reacting around a psychologically important area near $2,000. When a market hovers around a major round number after a rebound, it tends to behave like a magnet. It pulls price in both directions until one side finally wins acceptance.</p><p data-start=\"1549\" data-end=\"1699\">Educational note: round numbers like $2,000 and $70,000 are not magic, but they attract liquidity. That liquidity can amplify fakeouts and fast moves.</p><h2 data-start=\"1706\" data-end=\"1767\">The 4H footprint view: what the market is saying right now</h2><p data-start=\"1769\" data-end=\"1872\">When you zoom into the 4H footprint sequence, you can see the “story of effort vs result” more clearly.</p><h3 data-start=\"1874\" data-end=\"1922\">BTC 4H: push, rejection, then low-delta chop</h3><p data-start=\"1923\" data-end=\"2110\">BTC printed a clean expansion higher, then got hit with a meaningful response sell bar. After that, the more recent bars show very small delta and smaller participation. That often means:</p><ul data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2280\"><li data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2176\"><p data-start=\"2114\" data-end=\"2176\">Sellers took a shot and did not immediately get follow-through</p></li><li data-start=\"2177\" data-end=\"2228\"><p data-start=\"2179\" data-end=\"2228\">Buyers are not aggressively lifting offers either</p></li><li data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2280\"><p data-start=\"2231\" data-end=\"2280\">The market is rotating into balance, not trending</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"2282\" data-end=\"2452\">Educational note: low delta during sideways price action is often a “wait state.” The next break can be sharp because liquidity builds up while participation looks quiet.</p><h3 data-start=\"2454\" data-end=\"2521\">ETH 4H: rejection had more teeth, stabilization attempt follows</h3><p data-start=\"2522\" data-end=\"2841\">ETH also had the impulse higher, but its rejection bar looks more forceful and the stabilization is less convincing. The good news for bulls is that sell pressure appears to cool after the rejection. The challenge is that ETH still needs to reclaim overhead zones to prove that the rebound is turning into continuation.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3087\">Educational note: a strong rejection followed by shrinking negative delta is a common early stabilization pattern. It is not a reversal signal by itself. It is a “pressure is reducing” signal that still needs confirmation from price acceptance.</p><h2 data-start=\"3094\" data-end=\"3149\">Key zones traders keep reacting to (why they matter)</h2><p data-start=\"3151\" data-end=\"3304\">You can think of these as “acceptance tests.” The market often wicks into them, but what matters is whether price can hold and build above or below them.</p><h3 data-start=\"3306\" data-end=\"3325\">Bitcoin futures</h3><ul data-start=\"3326\" data-end=\"3458\"><li data-start=\"3326\" data-end=\"3373\"><p data-start=\"3328\" data-end=\"3373\">Overhead supply zone: roughly $68,750-$69,000</p></li><li data-start=\"3374\" data-end=\"3411\"><p data-start=\"3376\" data-end=\"3411\">First support area: roughly $67,750</p></li><li data-start=\"3412\" data-end=\"3458\"><p data-start=\"3414\" data-end=\"3458\">Deeper support area: roughly $67,200-$66,700</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3460\" data-end=\"3706\">Why it matters: BTC is currently doing business in a range where both sides are probing. Acceptance above the overhead supply zone shifts odds toward continuation. Acceptance below the deeper support zone shifts odds toward a fade of the rebound.</p><h3 data-start=\"3708\" data-end=\"3725\">Ether futures</h3><ul data-start=\"3726\" data-end=\"3850\"><li data-start=\"3726\" data-end=\"3771\"><p data-start=\"3728\" data-end=\"3771\">Overhead supply zone: roughly $2,075-$2,100</p></li><li data-start=\"3772\" data-end=\"3815\"><p data-start=\"3774\" data-end=\"3815\">First support area: roughly $2,055-$2,045</p></li><li data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"3850\"><p data-start=\"3818\" data-end=\"3850\">Major psychological line: $2,000</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3852\" data-end=\"4114\">Why it matters: $2,000 is a liquidity magnet. Markets often whip around these levels. A clean hold above the overhead zone improves the bull case. Sustained trade below $2,000 tends to change sentiment quickly because it signals that the rebound failed to stick.</p><h2 data-start=\"4121\" data-end=\"4184\">What “sustained acceptance” actually means </h2><p data-start=\"4185\" data-end=\"4261\">A lot of traders get chopped up because they treat one wick as confirmation.</p><p data-start=\"4263\" data-end=\"4293\">A more disciplined definition:</p><ul data-start=\"4294\" data-end=\"4436\"><li data-start=\"4294\" data-end=\"4333\"><p data-start=\"4296\" data-end=\"4333\">One spike through a level is a test</p></li><li data-start=\"4334\" data-end=\"4385\"><p data-start=\"4336\" data-end=\"4385\">Multiple closes holding the level is acceptance</p></li><li data-start=\"4386\" data-end=\"4436\"><p data-start=\"4388\" data-end=\"4436\">Acceptance plus follow-through is confirmation</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4438\" data-end=\"4530\">This matters because both BTC and ETH are currently in conditions where fakeouts are common.</p><h2 data-start=\"4537\" data-end=\"4585\">Practical takeaways for crypto traders and investors</h2><h3 data-start=\"4587\" data-end=\"4606\">For day traders</h3><ul data-start=\"4607\" data-end=\"4851\"><li data-start=\"4607\" data-end=\"4685\"><p data-start=\"4609\" data-end=\"4685\">Expect chop until the market proves acceptance above or below the key zones.</p></li><li data-start=\"4686\" data-end=\"4761\"><p data-start=\"4688\" data-end=\"4761\">In balance regimes, getting “married to direction” tends to be expensive.</p></li><li data-start=\"4762\" data-end=\"4851\"><p data-start=\"4764\" data-end=\"4851\">Focus on reaction quality: does price hold above the reclaim, or snap back immediately?</p></li></ul><h3 data-start=\"4853\" data-end=\"4888\">For swing traders and investors</h3><ul data-start=\"4889\" data-end=\"5202\"><li data-start=\"4889\" data-end=\"4977\"><p data-start=\"4891\" data-end=\"4977\">This is still a post-rebound digestion phase. That can resolve higher, or it can fade.</p></li><li data-start=\"4978\" data-end=\"5075\"><p data-start=\"4980\" data-end=\"5075\">You want to see the market build value higher over time, not just print one strong rebound day.</p></li><li data-start=\"5076\" data-end=\"5202\"><p data-start=\"5078\" data-end=\"5202\">If you are positioning longer-term, the best signal is usually not the first push, it is the ability to hold after the push.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"5209\" data-end=\"5223\">Crypto followers should now stay patient and watch the key price levels</h2><p data-start=\"5224\" data-end=\"5382\">Daily says: the rebound is real, but it is stalling under supply.<br data-start=\"5289\" data-end=\"5292\">\n4H says: BTC is stalling in balance, ETH is stalling with a slightly stronger rejection.</p><p data-start=\"5224\" data-end=\"5382\"><strong data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3243\">If 4H stays constructive while daily is still bearish:</strong> expect chop and sharp swings.

It’s pretty clear at this point that\ntariffs are here to stay as Trump reimposed them using different laws. Overall,\nnot much has changed.</p><p>The price action remains\nmostly rangebound as traders await new catalysts and further developments to\npick a direction. </p><p>The real risks remain a\npotential US-Iran military escalation which could boost the greenback on severe\nrisk-off mood or a hawkish repricing on stronger US data which would have a\npositive effect on the USD. Fed’s Waller placed a great deal on next week’s NFP\nreport. </p><p><strong><u>EUR:</u></strong></p><p>On the EUR side, nothing\nhas changed. As a reminder, the ECB held interest rates steady as widely\nexpected at the last meeting and kept the same data-dependent and\nmeeting-by-meeting guidance. The policymakers have eased the rhetoric on the\neuro recently after the currency dropped below the 1.20 level against the\ndollar. </p><p>The focus remains on\ninflation as the central bank has repeatedly stated that it won’t respond to\nsmall or short-term deviations from the 2% target. The data for now has been\npositive with economic activity picking up and core inflation hovering just a\nbit above target.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">EURUSD TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURUSD/\">EURUSD</a> is consolidating around the\n1.18 handle as traders await new catalysts to pick a direction. From a risk management\nperspective, the sellers will have a better risk to reward setup around the\n1.1927 level to position for a drop into the 1.16 handle next. The buyers, on\nthe other hand, will want to see the price breaking above that level to open\nthe door for a rally into new cycle highs.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">EURUSD TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can\nsee more clearly the rangebound price action between a few support and\nresistance zones. The buyers will likely step in around the 1.1807 support with\na defined risk below it to extend the rally into the 1.1850 resistance. The\nsellers, on the other hand, will look for a break lower to pile in for a drop\ninto the 1.1750 support next.</p><h2>EURUSD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS –\n1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the 1 hour chart, there’s not much else we can add here as the buyers\nwill look for a bounce around the support, while the sellers will look for a\nbreak lower.

Given the lack of key catalysts in the session ahead, the expiries could act as bookends for price action in European morning trade. That especially now that we're seeing price nudge back just above the 1.1800 mark on the day.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The key hourly moving averages are lined up around 1.1791-06 currently, so that will also provide a bit of a floor in terms of managing the downside. The expiries at 1.1820-25 don't tie to any technical significance but as mentioned, could act as a magnet to limit the upside potential in the event of any price range extensions.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In terms of economic data, the US weekly jobless claims is the only notable thing on the agenda today. As such, traders will be left to their own devices mostly in digesting Nvidia's earnings, geopolitical concerns, and any further tariff headlines in the day ahead.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">For more information on how to use this data, you may refer to this post <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/Education/!/forexlive-education-option-contracts-their-impact-and-how-to-trade-off-them-20161116/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link\">here</a>.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>Head on over to <a href=\"https://www.investinglive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link article-link\">investingLive</a> (formerly ForexLive) to get in on the know!</em></p>",

            "description": "<ul><li>Does not think that the BOJ is behind the curve for now</li><li>But want to ensure BOJ doesn't fall behind the curve in addressing inflation risks</li><li>Difficult to determine the desirable pace of rate hikes and also the terminal rate</li><li>Pace of future rate hikes will depend on economic, price, market developments at the time</li><li>There are pros and cons to a weak Japanese yen currency</li></ul><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The comments above are more neutral but we've already seen his hawkish side earlier in the day <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/bojs-takata-says-japan-is-near-2-target-backs-further-gradual-rate-hikes-20260226/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">here</a>. Adding to the commentary from earlier was BOJ governor Ueda who <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/bojs-ueda-flags-march-april-hike-chance-says-wage-gains-could-hasten-2-target-20260225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">hinted</a> that the March and April meetings will be live. That is despite prime minister Takaichi's reported reservations and reluctance in wanting the BOJ to get on with the next rate hike so soon.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In terms of market pricing though, traders are not seeing any potential for a policy change on 19 March next month. The odds of there being no change to the policy rate are at ~87% currently. The following meeting on 28 April will be more interesting, with traders pricing in ~54% odds of a 25 bps rate hike.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">It's all going to ride on the spring wage negotiations and then seeing if Ueda &amp; co. will have the appetite to deliver on another rate hike before Takaichi's choice of replacement board members step in.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As a reminder, we will be seeing Asahi Noguchi and Junko Nakagawa depart from the central bank at the end of March and June respectively. They will be replaced by Toichiro Asada and Ayano Sato, both of whom are likely to shift the internal debate at the central bank and stall further rate hikes.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">For some context, Noguchi - while being a dovish member - still sided with the last two rate hikes while Nakagawa is more of a consensus voter in keeping the peace. With Asada and Sato, one can expect both to reflect a more \"reformed\" dovish approach in aligning more with the government's goal</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">The bar was already set incredibly high for Nvidia going into this week's earnings call, as it has been for many quarters now. And once again, the chip giant defies concerns to the AI trade with a strong <em>triple beat</em> so to speak. All three of revenue, earnings, and guidance hit their market and then some. And that is keeping optimism on the AI trade in general, although the early market reaction has been more mixed.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Nvidia shares rose over 3% in after-hours trading before settling down a fair bit. And US futures in general are also following suit to keep more muted on the day. S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.1% with Nasdaq futures down 0.3% currently. So, what gives?</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The early market reaction hints that with the bar already set so high for Nvidia, clearing that is \"expected\" and fits within the norm these days. While Nvidia still has to do a lot of heavy lifting in keeping market sentiment up, they are often times viewed as the poster boy for the AI rally. As such, \"perfection\" can be seen as the bare minimum in some sense.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">However, adding to the more reserved market response so far today is continued geopolitical and trade uncertainty. The US-Iran conflict remains in focus and could yet evolve into military escalation. Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs are still being met with all sorts of uncertainty with the latest being that perhaps not all countries will be hit with 15% levies - only some. Geez.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">And on the latter, there's also the thought of what is going to happen next once the 150 days are up on Section 122. In all likelihood, it won't be extended and so it remains to be seen what Trump will have up his sleeves next.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Circling back to the AI agenda, there's also some concerns on how the hyperscalers i.e. Google, Meta, Microsoft can keep up on capex spending to support the outlook portrayed by Nvidia. And adding to that, there's still the whole hardware versus software debate. While the former continues to outperform, the latter is suffering from the continued AI disruption that Nvidia is powering.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">So while there is optimism on the big names, there is once again perhaps a change to \"the rest of the market\" problem for investors. Just something to keep in mind.</p>",

Takata argued that medium- and long-term inflation expectations are rising and second-round price effects are becoming more evident.</p><p data-start=\"1845\" data-end=\"2081\">AUD and NZD were broadly steady.

The Bank of Korea’s updated dot plot reinforced a 2.50% hold bias, with only a small minority signalling scope for a cut.

            "description": "<p>Economists upgrade Singapore’s 2026 growth outlook and are increasingly split on whether the MAS will tighten policy at its April 2026 review.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li data-start=\"22\" data-end=\"186\"><p data-start=\"24\" data-end=\"186\">Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Q1 survey (released 25 February 2026) shows economists lift 2026 GDP growth forecast to 3.6% (prev. 2.3%).</p></li><li data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"305\"><p data-start=\"189\" data-end=\"305\">Nearly 47.4% now expect a policy tightening at the April 2026 MAS review, up sharply from 5.6% previously.</p></li><li data-start=\"306\" data-end=\"423\"><p data-start=\"308\" data-end=\"423\">Median core inflation forecast rises to 1.5% (from 1.3%); headline inflation seen steady at 1.5%.</p></li><li data-start=\"424\" data-end=\"500\"><p data-start=\"426\" data-end=\"500\">Government growth range sits at 2–4% (raised in February from 1–3%).</p></li><li data-start=\"501\" data-end=\"614\"><p data-start=\"503\" data-end=\"614\">Top downside risks: geopolitical tensions, AI bubble burst; upside risk: sustained AI-led tech cycle.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"1822\" data-end=\"2118\">The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, released on 25 February 2026, showed a notably stronger outlook for the economy this year, with economists raising their median forecast for 2026 GDP growth to 3.6%, up from 2.3% in the previous survey.</p><p data-start=\"2120\" data-end=\"2361\">The poll, sent to 25 economists on February 10 with 22 responses received, does not represent the official views of the MAS but provides a useful gauge of market expectations ahead of the central bank’s April 2026 monetary policy review.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2699\">The upgraded growth projection compares with the government’s official forecast range of 2% to 4%, which itself was revised higher in February from 1% to 3%. The stronger outlook reflects resilience in Singapore’s externally oriented sectors and expectations of continued support from technology and advanced manufacturing activity.</p><p data-start=\"2701\" data-end=\"3168\">Monetary policy expectations have shifted materially. The survey showed 47.4% of economists now anticipate a tightening move in April, specifically through an increase in the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band. That marks a sharp rise from just 5.6% expecting tightening three months ago, underscoring how sentiment has turned as growth forecasts improved. The remainder expect policy settings to be left unchanged.</p><p data-start=\"3170\" data-end=\"3544\">On inflation, economists see modest upward pressure but within manageable bounds. The median forecast for core inflation, MAS’s preferred gauge, increased to 1.5% from 1.3%, while headline inflation is projected to remain at 1.5%. Both measures sit comfortably within the MAS’s official 1%–2% forecast range, suggesting policymakers retain flexibility.</p><p data-start=\"3546\" data-end=\"3781\">Respondents flagged geopolitical tensions and the risk of a bursting artificial intelligence investment bubble as key downside threats. Conversely, a sustained AI-driven technology upcycle remains the primary upside risk to growth.</p><p data-start=\"3783\" data-end=\"4002\">With growth expectations strengthening but inflation contained, the April MAS decision is shaping up as a close call, with currency policy settings likely to remain the central transmission mechanism for any adjustment.</p>",

            "description": "<p>China’s Two Sessions (4–11 March) is shaping up as a “targets + 15th plan signalling” event, more about direction and policy bias than a single mega-stimulus headline.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li data-start=\"23\" data-end=\"276\"><p data-start=\"25\" data-end=\"276\">China’s “Two Sessions” will open in Beijing on 4 March (CPPCC) and 5 March 2026 (NPC), with the headline policy statement coming via the Government Work Report by Premier Li Qiang on 5 March. </p></li><li data-start=\"277\" data-end=\"489\"><p data-start=\"279\" data-end=\"489\">2026 is a key “bridge year” into the 15th five-year plan (2026–2030), with authorities preparing plan-related documents for March deliberations and public signalling. </p></li><li data-start=\"490\" data-end=\"737\"><p data-start=\"492\" data-end=\"737\">Market focus is on whether Beijing marks down the GDP target from “around 5%” to ~4.5%–5%, which would formalise the shift toward “quality/security” framing and lower the bar for big-bang stimulus. </p></li><li data-start=\"738\" data-end=\"1010\"><p data-start=\"740\" data-end=\"1010\">A fiscal deficit ratio around ~4% of GDP is widely discussed as the “base case”, with support potentially pushed via special bond issuance / quasi-fiscal channels and targeted spending rather than a headline-deficit surge. </p></li><li data-start=\"1011\" data-end=\"1281\"><p data-start=\"1013\" data-end=\"1281\">Domestic-demand support (trade-ins/vouchers, services consumption, welfare) is expected to feature, but the policy tone is likely to keep emphasising industrial upgrading, innovation and security amid US–China tech friction. </p></li><li data-start=\"1282\" data-end=\"1508\"><p data-start=\"1284\" data-end=\"1508\">Watch for language on the property downturn, local-government finances, and “financial sector serving the real economy” as Beijing tries to lift confidence without reigniting leverage.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3108\" data-end=\"3591\">China’s annual “Two Sessions” will convene in Beijing in early March, with the advisory CPPCC opening on 4 March and the national legislature, the NPC, beginning on 5 March. The focal point for markets is the Government Work Report, delivered by Premier Li Qiang on the NPC’s opening day, which typically sets the year’s headline targets and policy tasks and provides the clearest public read of Beijing’s macro stance. </p><p data-start=\"3593\" data-end=\"4091\">This year matters more than usual because it also serves as the on-ramp to the 15th five-year plan (2026–2030). While the plan’s full detail is built through Party and state processes, officials have already been workshopping plan-related and work-report drafts ahead of March, meaning investors should expect heavier-than-normal signalling on medium-term priorities, especially around industrial upgrading, technology self-reliance and economic security. </p><p data-start=\"4093\" data-end=\"4434\">On the near-term macro call, a key debate is whether Beijing trims the 2026 GDP growth target from “around 5%” to a range closer to 4.5%–5%. A formal step-down would underline the shift toward “high-quality growth” and reduce the political pressure for a large, broad-based stimulus package. </p><p data-start=\"4436\" data-end=\"5069\">Fiscal messaging is likely to balance support and discipline. Analysts broadly look for a headline deficit ratio around recent levels (often discussed near ~4% of GDP), with incremental support delivered through targeted programs and government-linked financing channels rather than a single dramatic deficit expansion. Alongside that, watch for any refreshed language on boosting domestic demand and improving social support, and for cues on how forcefully Beijing wants finance to channel credit into priority “future industries” while containing property and local-debt risks.</p>",
