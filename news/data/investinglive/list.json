The biggest challenge for China since the property market crash has been trying to revive domestic demand conditions. And until today, that remains one of the government's biggest hurdles in trying to get the local economy to prosper again.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The outline of needing to pursue more proactive fiscal policy and \"moderately loose\" monetary policy reaffirms the overall dual policy direction that Beijing has been sticking to in recent years. So, there's no changes there as we look to 2026.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Besides that, China is also making it clear that they also focused on market developments - especially when it comes to the yuan currency and the dollar. We've already seen a glimpse of that earlier in the day <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/pboc-cuts-fx-risk-reserve-ratio-to-0-slowing-yuan-appreciation-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">here</a> but they might have to do more if the greenback continues to weaken this year.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As a reminder, a weaker Chinese yuan was <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/news/is-this-beijings-first-line-of-defense-against-trump-20241203/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">China's first line of buffer</a> against Trump and his tariffs. As such, an even weaker dollar pretty much neutralises the playing field. A struggling dollar in that respect maximises the pain from tariffs and hurts competition from other countries more.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">German inflation remains one of, if not the key sticking point for the ECB in trying to sort out monetary policy setting. Price pressures in Europe's largest economy hasn't dropped off enough to allow for the central bank to take more steps in lowering interest rates further. And late last year, there were still stagflation concerns for the most part.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">On that final point, a lot of the fears have been allayed in the past two months at least. The German economy has held up well with a notable recovery in the manufacturing sector especially. Adding to that, we are seeing price pressures ease back slightly as well. That being said, German core annual inflation continues to keep well above the 2% threshold.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The January reading saw core prices stick at 2.5%, with services inflation once again staying rather stubborn. Service prices were seen up 3.2% compared to the same month a year ago, rising at an above-average rate still. As such, that's keeping policymakers on their toes and alongside a somewhat similar picture in Spain is putting the central bank on the sidelines currently.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Looking to the February estimates, German headline inflation is expected to keep thereabouts again as in January. Headline annual inflation is estimated at 2.0%, marginally lower from the 2.1% reading last month. The EU-harmonised estimate is expected to be the same at 2.1%.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">But again, all eyes will be on the core annual inflation estimate. And that will be the one that will matter most when viewing the report today.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Besides that, just be wary of the monthly figures with it expected to show another increase of 0.5% in January. If realised, that will mark the biggest monthly jump in headline prices since April 2024.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Here's the agenda for today:</p><ul class=\"text-align-start vertical-align-baseline\"><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - North Rhine Westphalia</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Hesse</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Bavaria</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Baden Wuerttemberg</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">0900 GMT - Saxony</strong></li><li class=\"vertical-align-baseline\"><strong class=\"vertical-align-baseline\">1300 GMT - Germany national preliminary figures</strong></li></ul><p class=\"vertical-align-baseline text-align-justify\">Do note that the releases don't exactly follow the schedule at times and may be released a little earlier or later.</p>",

The People’s Bank of China cut the FX risk reserve ratio to 0%, reversing a tool previously used to support the currency. Raising the ratio makes it more expensive to short the RMB via forwards, while today’s move removes some of that support at the margin. By lowering hedging costs, the decision may encourage greater forward activity and modestly trim appreciation pressure, prompting the yuan to ease. In another move the Bank set the refernce rate more than 800 points away from the modelled estimate, a record wide gap. </p><p data-start=\"1188\" data-end=\"1637\">In corporate news, Block announced it will cut more than 4,000 roles, reducing headcount from over 10,000 to just under 6,000.

The comments underscore officials’ sensitivity to yen weakness as a cost-of-living issue, particularly via import prices, at a time when politics, fiscal policy and central-bank messaging are pulling in different directions.</p><p data-start=\"1553\" data-end=\"2058\">The political backdrop is doing the yen no favours. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, fresh off a strong election mandate, has pitched a shift away from fiscal austerity, including multi-year investment plans and tax-relief proposals aimed at lifting growth. While framed as pro-growth, the agenda has revived concerns about Japan’s already heavy debt load, and, by extension, higher term premia and a weaker currency if investors demand more compensation to hold JGBs. </p><p data-start=\"2060\" data-end=\"2418\">Monetary policy has become the other flashpoint. <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/forex/the-japanese-yen-sinks-as-pm-takaichi-signals-opposition-to-further-boj-rate-hikes-20260224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">Takaichi has been reported as wary of additional BOJ rate hikes</a>, and her government’s nomination of two likely dovish-leaning academics to the BOJ policy board was read by markets as an attempt to tilt the debate toward a slower normalisation path. The yen weakened on the news. </p><p data-start=\"2420\" data-end=\"3046\">Yet the BOJ’s internal messaging remains split rather than uniformly dovish. Board member Hajime Takata, widely seen as one of the most hawkish voices, reiterated that policymakers should stay alert to inflation overshoot risks and continue gradual hikes.  Meanwhile, Tokyo’s February inflation data delivered a mixed signal: core inflation (ex fresh food) slipped to 1.8% but the “core-core” gauge (ex fresh food and energy) ticked up to 2.5%, broadly consistent with the BOJ’s view that any slowdown is temporary due to subsidies and base effects. </p><p data-start=\"3048\" data-end=\"3411\">The upshot for markets is a familiar tension: officials talk tougher on FX as the yen weakens, while domestic politics leans toward easier financial conditions and the BOJ debates how quickly to tighten. That combination keeps intervention rhetoric alive, but also keeps the yen sensitive to swings in US yields and shifting expectations around the next BOJ move.</p>",

The measure reverses a September 2022 tightening that was originally introduced to stem sharp yuan depreciation and capital outflows.</p><p data-start=\"956\" data-end=\"1402\">By removing the reserve requirement, effectively a “speed bump” on forward dollar purchases, the PBOC has<a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/usdcny-usdcnh-jump-as-pboc-cuts-fx-rrr-to-zero-cooling-yuan-gains-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\"> lowered the cost of shorting the yuan</a> and buying dollars via forwards. While officials framed the decision as supporting enterprises in managing exchange-rate risks, the timing suggests policymakers are also keen to temper one-way appreciation pressure after the currency recently climbed to near three-year highs against a softer dollar.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1672\">In a further signal, the <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/pboc-sets-usd-cny-reference-rate-for-today-at-69228-vs-estimate-at-68428-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">PBOC held the daily USD/CNY midpoint at 6.922</a>8, resisting expectations for another fresh 33-month low. The steady fix, combined with stronger USD-positive damping, is seen as establishing a near-term floor around Thursday’s trough near 6.8310.</p><p data-start=\"1674\" data-end=\"1952\">The immediate market response saw USD/CNH rebound, with traders trimming crowded yuan-long bets. Analysts expect USD/CNY to rise moderately before stabilising in a 6.9000–6.9500 range, reflecting a policy stance aimed at smoothing gains rather than reversing direction outright.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2298\">Chart signals also point to fading downside momentum in USD/CNY. A long-tailed doji formation suggested exhaustion in the recent decline, while a break above the 6.8868 Bollinger channel ceiling would reinforce the case for a corrective bounce toward the 21-day moving average near 6.9235 and potentially toward the upper channel around 6.9560.</p><p data-start=\"2300\" data-end=\"2569\">Over the past decade, the PBOC has repeatedly adjusted the FX risk reserve ratio to manage two-way currency pressures. The latest move fits that pattern: not an attempt to weaken the yuan materially, but a calibrated step to curb excessive strength and damp volatility. </p>",

Officials have maintained they will keep raising rates if economic and price forecasts materialise.</p><p data-start=\"2159\" data-end=\"2479\">Separately, factory output rose 2.2% in January, its first increase in three months, driven by double-digit car production gains. However, the rebound undershot the median forecast for a 5.3% rise, and manufacturers expect output to fall again in February and March,  underscoring fragility in the industrial sector.</p><p data-start=\"2481\" data-end=\"2685\">For now, Tokyo’s data reinforces the BOJ’s narrative: inflation is softening temporarily due to policy and base effects, but underlying price pressures remain consistent with gradual policy normalisation.</p>",

By scrapping the requirement, the PBOC effectively lowers the cost for financial institutions to purchase foreign exchange via forward contracts — making it cheaper to buy U.S. dollars and hedge currency exposure.</p><p data-start=\"1152\" data-end=\"1501\">The move comes against a markedly different backdrop from 2022. The yuan posted its strongest annual gain against the dollar since 2020 last year, breaking back through the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level, with momentum carrying into early 2026. Recent sessions saw both onshore (CNY) and offshore (CNH) yuan touch fresh 33-month highs.</p><p data-start=\"1503\" data-end=\"1901\">By cutting the FX risk reserve ratio to zero, the PBOC is removing a previous deterrent to forward-based RMB short positioning. Higher ratios raise the cost of selling the yuan via forwards, supporting the currency by increasing hedging friction. Today’s move reduces that friction, and is widely interpreted as an attempt to temper yuan appreciation rather than to stimulate depreciation outright.</p><p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2367\">The market reaction was swift. Offshore USD/CNH jumped, up around 0.3% on the session, before easing slightly. Traders viewed the change as a signal that authorities are comfortable allowing some retracement after the currency’s strong run. Notably, the PBOC kept the USD/CNY midpoint broadly unchanged from Thursday at 6.9228, with a massive <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/pboc-sets-usd-cny-reference-rate-for-today-at-69228-vs-estimate-at-68428-20260227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">800+ difference from the model estimate, a record gap. </a></p><p data-start=\"2369\" data-end=\"2776\">Analysts said the move serves a dual purpose: improving hedging efficiency and forward-market liquidity, while also acting as a calibrated measure to cool excessive one-way appreciation pressure. By making dollar buying less expensive, policymakers are subtly rebalancing expectations without abandoning their broader commitment to keeping the renminbi “basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level.”</p><p data-start=\"2369\" data-end=\"2776\">Pan Gongsheng, People's Bank of China governor, has had enough of you buying so much yuan. </p>",

The PBOC said it will continue encouraging financial institutions to strengthen hedging services while maintaining the renminbi broadly stable at a reasonable and balanced level.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"0\" id=\"p-rc_c4ff7db073f4f380-19\">Typically, you use a 20% \"penalty\" ratio to stop the currency from falling (by making it expensive to bet against it). Removing it when the Yuan is already strong seems counterintuitive at first, but there are four strategic reasons why the PBOC would do this:</p><p class=\"source-inline-chip-container ng-star-inserted\">1. Slowing Down \"Too Much\" Appreciation</p><p data-path-to-node=\"2\">A currency that is <em data-path-to-node=\"2\" data-index-in-node=\"19\">too</em> strong is a double-edged sword. While it shows economic strength, it makes Chinese exports more expensive for the rest of the world.</p><ul data-path-to-node=\"3\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"3,0,0\">By cutting the ratio to 0%, the PBOC makes it cheaper for companies to buy US Dollars (forward sales).</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"3,1,0\">This increase in demand for Dollars acts as a natural \"brake\" on the Yuan’s rise without the PBOC having to intervene directly in the markets.</p></li></ul><p>2. Punishing \"One-Way Bets\"</p><p data-path-to-node=\"5\" id=\"p-rc_c4ff7db073f4f380-20\">The PBOC hates \"herd behavior.\" If everyone believes the Yuan will only go up, speculators pile in, creating a bubble.</p><ul data-path-to-node=\"6\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"6,0,0\" id=\"p-rc_c4ff7db073f4f380-21\">When the ratio was 20%, it was expensive to bet on a weaker Yuan.</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"6,0,0\" id=\"p-rc_c4ff7db073f4f380-21\">By moving to 0%, the PBOC is \"leveling the playing field.\" They are making it easier for market participants to take the opposite side of the trade, which creates two-way volatility and prevents a speculative runaway in the Yuan's value.</p></li></ul><p>3. Normalizing Policy (The \"Exit\" Strategy)</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">The 20% ratio is considered a \"counter-cyclical\" tool—it’s an emergency measure.</p><ul data-path-to-node=\"9\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"9,0,0\">Keeping an emergency measure active when the currency is strong sends a confusing signal to global markets.</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"9,1,0\">Moving to 0% signals that the PBOC believes the market has returned to a \"healthy\" state and no longer needs \"training wheels\" or artificial barriers. It is a sign of confidence that the Yuan can stand on its own without restrictive rules.</p></li></ul><p>4. Reducing the \"Cost of Doing Business\"</p><p data-path-to-node=\"11\">For a Chinese importer who needs to buy Dollars six months from now, that 20% reserve was essentially a dead-weight cost passed down from their bank.</p><ul data-path-to-node=\"12\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"12,0,0\">Even if the Yuan is strong, these companies still need to hedge to ensure their profit margins.</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"12,1,0\">Removing the ratio lowers their operational costs, effectively acting as a targeted stimulus for companies involved in international trade.</p></li></ul><p>---</p><p>Watch for the PBOC's next move. If the Yuan continues to rocket upward despite this change, they may use \"window guidance\" (calling bank executives to suggest they buy more Dollars) or even raise the Foreign Exchange Reserve Requirement Ratio (FX RRR), which forces banks to hold more actual USD in vaults, taking it out of circulation.</p>",

The current trading band permits the currency to move plus or minus 2% from the official midpoint during onshore trading hours. </p><p>Each morning, the PBOC determines the midpoint based on a range of inputs. These include the previous day’s closing price, movements in major currencies, particularly the US dollar, broader international FX conditions, and domestic economic considerations such as capital flows, growth momentum and financial stability objectives. The midpoint is not a purely mechanical calculation, allowing policymakers discretion to guide market expectations. </p><p>Once the midpoint is announced, onshore USD/CNY is free to trade within the allowable band. If market pressures push the yuan toward either edge of that range, the central bank may step in to smooth volatility. Intervention can take the form of direct buying or selling of yuan, adjustments to liquidity conditions, or guidance through state-owned banks. </p><p>As a result, the daily fixing is often interpreted as a policy signal rather than just a technical reference point. A stronger-than-expected CNY midpoint is typically read as a sign the PBOC is leaning against depreciation pressure, while a weaker fixing for the CNY can indicate tolerance for a softer currency, often in response to dollar strength or domestic economic headwinds.</p><p>In periods of heightened global volatility, such as shifts in US rate expectations, trade tensions or capital flow pressures, the fixing takes on added significance. For investors, it provides insight into Beijing’s currency priorities, balancing competitiveness, capital stability and financial market confidence.</p>",

The drop was driven primarily by weaker perceptions of personal finances, with rising unemployment weighing on household sentiment.</p><p data-start=\"1057\" data-end=\"1334\">Official figures last week showed the UK jobless rate climbed to 5.2% in the final quarter of 2025, its highest level since the three months to January 2021. GfK’s Neil Bellamy said concerns about job security are intensifying as unemployment reaches a near five-year high.</p><p data-start=\"1336\" data-end=\"1703\">The deterioration in sentiment comes despite some tentative signs of resilience elsewhere. Business activity and retail sales data have shown improvement at the start of the year following a weak end to 2025. Meanwhile, Britain’s household savings rate remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms, a potential cushion for consumption should confidence stabilise.</p><p data-start=\"1705\" data-end=\"1956\">On the industrial side, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed UK car production fell 8.2% year-on-year to 65,249 units in January, as exports dropped 10.1% to 51,396 units amid softer demand in key overseas markets.</p><p data-start=\"1958\" data-end=\"2178\">Overall vehicle output, including commercial vehicles, declined 13.6% to 67,415 units. Commercial vehicle production slumped 68.6%, marking a tenth consecutive monthly decline following major plant restructuring.</p><p data-start=\"2180\" data-end=\"2512\">SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said the figures underscore the need for a forward-looking trade agenda that preserves preferential access to major markets, notably the European Union, amid rising protectionist rhetoric, including “Made in Europe” proposals. The EU, U.S. and China remain among the UK’s largest export destinations for autos.</p><p data-start=\"2514\" data-end=\"2727\">Despite the weak start to 2026, industry forecasts still project total UK car production could recover to around 790,000 units in 2026, suggesting January’s decline may not yet represent a structural downturn.</p><p data-start=\"2729\" data-end=\"3074\">Taken together, the data paints a mixed macro picture: softer household confidence and rising unemployment on one side, tentative activity stabilisation and hopes of an industrial rebound on the other.

The market response was immediate: Block shares surged around 25% in after-hours trade after the announcement landed alongside its fourth-quarter earnings. </p><p data-start=\"1983\" data-end=\"2564\">The reason this reads as a potential “floodgates” moment is the framing. Block’s CFO Amrita Ahuja said the company is deliberately shifting how it operates “at a time when our business is accelerating,” using smaller, highly talented teams and AI to automate more work.  Dorsey went further, arguing “intelligence tools” are changing what it means to build and run a company,  and that within the next year, most companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. </p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2852\">That’s the signal investors appeared to price: not just a one-off cost cut, but a blueprint for margin expansion and faster execution if AI genuinely substitutes for a chunk of internal labour. In other words, a CEO explicitly saying the quiet part out loud, and being rewarded for it.</p><p data-start=\"2854\" data-end=\"3237\">The financial backdrop helped. Block reported adjusted EPS of 65 cents on $6.25 billion in revenue for Q4, and gross profit rose 24% to $2.87 billion.  For 2026, the company guided adjusted EPS of $3.66, ahead of the $3.22 analysts were looking for (per LSEG as cited by Reuters). </p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3726\">The trade-off is the near-term bill: Block expects $450 million to $500 million in restructuring charges, mostly in the first quarter, primarily severance/benefits plus non-cash costs tied to share vesting.  But the after-hours move suggests investors are focused on the longer-term operating model — and that’s why this could be “first of many” across tech and fintech if boards decide the market will pay up for decisive, AI-led restructures.</p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3726\">---</p><p data-start=\"1442\" data-end=\"2039\">The bigger macro read-through is that Block <s>may</s>, lets be real here, WILL be an early, unusually candid signal of a broader labour-market transition, and one markets might actively incentivise. If a high-profile company can explicitly frame layoffs as “AI replaces work” and get a +20%-plus repricing, the boardroom lesson is simple: move fast, reset the cost base, and capture operating leverage before competitors do. That dynamic risks opening the floodgates, particularly across tech, fintech, advertising, software, consulting and corporate back offices, where tasks are modular and AI tools can be deployed quickly.</p><p data-start=\"2041\" data-end=\"2567\">At the economy level, this could look like a productivity boom paired with a white-collar employment shock. Over time, higher productivity is a positive. But the transition matters: mass job losses can depress wage growth, weaken household spending and lift political pressure, especially if displaced workers struggle to move into new roles at similar pay. The near-term inflation impulse may actually be disinflationary (lower labour costs, weaker demand), even as it concentrates pain in certain industries and geographies.</p><p data-start=\"2569\" data-end=\"3032\">For policymakers, the challenge is sequencing. Central banks could face a world where inflation falls faster than expected, but growth becomes more fragile and the unemployment rate rises, complicating any “higher for longer” stance. For markets, the reflex is already visible: reward decisive AI-enabled restructuring as a path to margins and cash flow. If that continues, “AI-led layoffs” may become a recurring feature of earnings season, not a one-off shock.</p>",

The move follows what was already a strong quarterly update that underscored NVIDIA’s dominance in data centre accelerators and AI infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"1045\" data-end=\"1503\">UBS was similarly constructive. Analysts said it was “hard to see” why the stock has remained relatively flat given what they described as exceptional fundamentals. UBS pointed to stronger-than-expected revenue guidance, sustained hyperscaler demand and an order backlog that stretches into 2027. UBS also highlighted the potential for quarterly revenue to eventually approach the $100 billion mark if current AI infrastructure build-outs persist.</p><p data-start=\"1505\" data-end=\"2018\">The renewed support builds on the earnings result we covered yesterday, where NVIDIA again <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/nvidia-q4-crushes-q1-guide-tops-street-as-ai-engine-roars-20260225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">surprised to the upside</a> on both revenue and forward guidance. Data centre revenue remained the core engine, driven by accelerating deployment of next-generation AI chips and full-stack systems. <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/nvidias-huang-says-markets-misjudge-ai-threat-as-revenue-and-guidance-smash-forecasts-20260226/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">Management flagged continued strength</a> from cloud providers, enterprise AI adoption and sovereign AI investment, reinforcing the theme that AI infrastructure spending remains in a structural upcycle rather than a short-term boom.</p><p data-start=\"2020\" data-end=\"2282\">While valuation remains a point of debate, bulls argue earnings growth continues to outpace expectations. Both JPMorgan and UBS see scope for growth to re-accelerate as production constraints ease and next-generation platforms scale further into 2026 and beyond.</p><p data-start=\"2284\" data-end=\"2493\">In short, the message from the Street is clear: fundamentals remain strong, visibility is unusually long, and AI demand has yet to peak — even if the share price has paused after its outsized multi-year rally.</p>",
