            "description": "<p>Nvidia put its best foot forward with a big earnings beat but it isn't enough for the market. Shares were up around 1% in the pre-market but opened lower and are now down almost 5%. The drop is spreading beyond the company and the Nasdaq is down 1.7% and it's now even hitting FX with AUD/USD quickly falling 20 pips to the lows of the day.</p><p>Shares of NVDA were trying to break above the current range but have been pulled back in and are now likely to test the lower end of the range.</p><p>Other chipmakers are also getting hit today with Broadcom down 6.7%, Micron down 5.7% and Intel down 5.2%. Other high-flying AI related trades are also seeing profit taking.</p><p>On the whole though, advancers lead decliners in the S&amp;P 500 despite a 1.1% decline including some of the beaten up software names like FICO +6% and INTU +4.8%.</p><p>The price action suggests the market is pivoting away from AI trades in general and back to real economy bets. There is also an element of short-covering, which might suggest de-grossing in general.</p><p>I would also highlight the bond market, where US 10-year yields are testing 4% again. I don't know if a bear market in stock alone is enough to generate real flows into bonds or if we need a real weakening of the economy.</p><p>Then again, a drop in equities is often enough to cause a recession in a hyper-financialized economy like the USA. </p><p>Today's price action in NVDA makes it tough for me to believe that the AI narrative alone (despite how amazing the products are) is enough to sustain the market. Without that, it's a market that has things like Walmart trading at 44x earnings.

            "description": "<h2>Sector Overview: Mixed Movements Across Key Sectors</h2>\n<p>Today's stock market heatmap reveals a mixed picture across sectors, with distinct movements shaping the day's trading landscape. The technology sector demonstrates resilience, while semiconductors experience notable declines. Let’s delve into the details.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>📈 Technology Sector: A Bright Spot</strong><br>The technology sector shines brightly today. <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> gains 0.86% and <strong>Oracle (ORCL)</strong> increases by 0.75%, reflecting robust investor confidence. This upward trend suggests strengthening fundamentals and positive market sentiment towards tech infrastructure stocks.</li>\n\n<li><strong>📉 Semiconductor Setback</strong><br>In contrast, semiconductors encounter challenges. <strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> slides by 2.15% and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> drops by 1.31%, painting a picture of investor caution within this crucial tech sub-sector. Industry-specific pressures and global supply chain issues may be influencing these declines.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🏦 Financial Firmness</strong><br>The financial sector holds firm, with <strong>JPMorgan Chase (JPM)</strong> up by 0.89% and <strong>Visa (V)</strong> rising 0.52%. This stability may be attributed to positive economic outlooks and a resilient banking infrastructure supporting investor sentiments.</li>\n\n<li><strong>🚗 From Consumer Cyclical to Defensives</strong><br>The consumer cyclical landscape offers mixed signals; while <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> is marginally down by 0.09%, consumer defensive giants such as <strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> enjoy a 0.59% increase, hinting at a strategic shift towards safer, defensive investments amid market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Market Mood and Trends: Navigating the Mixed Signals</h2>\n<p>The market sentiment today is marked by sector-specific dynamics. While tech infrastructure stocks reflect positive trends driven by innovation and robust earnings, semiconductors face headwinds likely due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain worries.</p>\n<p>Investors appear cautious but hopeful, pivoting towards defensives as a hedge against market uncertainties. This suggests a strategic shift to mitigate potential risks in historically volatile sectors.</p>\n\n<h2>Strategic Recommendations: Navigating the Patchwork</h2>\n<p>Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to encompass a balanced mix of technology infrastructure and defensive sectors. Given the current pulse of the semiconductor market, staying vigilant on global news and sector reports will be prudent.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider increasing exposure in technology infrastructure stocks like MSFT and ORCL.</li>\n<li>Cautiously evaluate semiconductor investments until clearer signals emerge.</li>\n<li>Explore defensive stocks for portfolio stability, especially in consumer goods like WMT and PG.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Stay informed with real-time data and analyses at <a href=\"https://www.investinglive.com\">InvestingLive.com</a> to guide your investment strategies in such a dynamic market environment.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">NVIDIA delivered a monster Q4, posting record revenue of $68.1 billion — comfortably ahead of the $66.2 billion consensus estimate — with earnings of $1.62 per share (non-GAAP). Revenue surged 73% year-over-year, driven almost entirely by the data center juggernaut, which pulled in $62.3 billion and now accounts for 91% of total sales.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But the real headline was guidance. NVIDIA expects Q1 revenue of $78 billion (±2%), blowing past the $72.6 billion consensus and marking what would be the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Jensen Huang talked up the \"agentic AI inflection point\" and touted Blackwell as delivering an order-of-magnitude lower cost per token for inference workloads.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Yet the stock is up barely 1% in pre-market. That tells you everything about where the market's head is at right now — and looming large is what happened last quarter. After NVIDIA's Q3 report in November, shares spiked 4% in the initial after-hours reaction on another beat-and-raise, only to reverse and finish the following session 2% lower. Traders got burned chasing that move, and the memory of it is keeping a lid on enthusiasm this time around.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The broader debate has moved past whether NVIDIA can hit its numbers — it clearly can — and toward whether the hyperscaler capex cycle is sustainable. The big cloud players have seen more than $1 trillion wiped from their market caps since early February on exactly those fears. AMD got punished 17% despite beating expectations.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The question is whether NVDA's customers can turn their huge investments into chips into revenues and profits (and free cash flow) of their own, and whether the market is willing to wait years for that to unfold.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On the face of it though, the numbers are astonishing: Full-year revenue hit $215.9 billion, up 65%. Gross margins held up at 75% for the quarter. NVIDIA returned $41.1 billion to shareholders in FY26 (though much of that was eaten up by share-based comp).</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The numbers are pristine. The question is whether the market is ready to pay up for them when the macro AI narrative is under pressure — and whether this time, the post-earnings fade finally breaks.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In terms of the chart, it looks good to me as it tries to break out of the recent consolidation ahead of a fresh test of $212. One thing that lingers is a recent Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/stocks/mega-cap-tech-most-under-owned-in-17-years-says-morgan-stanley-20260219/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">report </a>saying that Nvidia is the most under-owned large-cap tech stock among institutional investors. Now could be the moment they pile in.</p>",

            "title": "BOJ up against the clock in delivering the next rate hike?",
            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">BOJ governor Ueda came out today with a bold statement, at least by his standards, in saying that their upcoming policy meetings in March and April will be <em>live</em>. The timing of that remark says a lot as it comes after his meeting with prime minister Takaichi, as well as the report yesterday that Takaichi voiced her concerns and reluctance towards the BOJ hiking rates again.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In terms of what might trigger the BOJ to act, it is all on the spring wage negotiations. The expected wage benchmark should see the 5% level hit again, which might compel the central bank to take action. But if they are not careful enough, they might just miss their timing to do so. That as we are about to see a reshuffle in policymakers making up the BOJ board.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Current policymakers Asahi Noguchi and Junko Nakagawa will be seeing their respective term end on 31 March and 29 June respectively. And prime minister Takaichi already has lined up her candidates of choice in replacing them.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">For some background, Noguchi is a dovish member but did pivot to support the last two rate hikes to bring the policy rate to 0.75%. As such, markets will be watching closely to see if he will deliver a \"parting gift\" in March to support one more rate hike before leaving.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for Nakagawa, she is more of a consensus voter at the central bank. In other words, she tends to stick with the general leanings of the majority of the board at the time. So, losing her is basically losing a <em>swing vote</em> so to speak in supporting the majority leanings of the BOJ board. But for now, at least she will stay on until the June meeting.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">So, who are the ones replacing them?</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Takaichi has lined up Toichiro Asada and Ayano Sato as the replacements to both Noguchi and Nakagawa respectively.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The idea is to put Asada and Sato in place to act as block and counterweight to the more hawkish leanings that the central bank wants to pursue.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">While on paper they do look like dove-for-dove replacements to Noguchi and Nakagawa, they are more reflationist in nature and that could provide some pushback against the BOJ's plans to hike rates moving forward.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Of note, Asada ascribes to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and argues that that debt doesn't matter as much as growth. In other words, the emphasis of his core principle is the necessity for coordinated fiscal and monetary policy to stabilise the economy.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for Sato, she is more from a legal background. And while her policy leanings aren't as clear, it is more than likely that she will favour a more institutional perspective in aligning with the government's goal of ensuring that monetary normalisation does not stifle economic growth.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">With all that in consideration, the BOJ might just be up against the clock in being able to deliver their next rate hike. If not careful, they could just miss that timing window.</p>",

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p>The S&amp;P 500 rebounded\nfrom the monthly lows as risk sentiment improved. There was no real catalyst\nfor the move as the market continues to trade in a range amid uncertainty on\nthe macro and geopolitical fronts. </p><p>The short-term uncertainty\ncaused by the US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs might have weighed on the\nmarket, but in the bigger picture it didn’t change much as Trump quickly\nreimposed new tariffs using different laws. The new levies reduce the effective\naverage tariff rate, which could be a positive at the margin. </p><p>In terms of Fed interest\nrates path, the market is still pricing 54 bps of easing by year-end which\ncould be at risk of a hawkish repricing on further improvement in the US labour\nmarket data. In fact, Fed’s Waller mentioned that he might want to hold rates\nsteady if we see a repeat of the strong January’s NFP report. Therefore, next\nFriday is going to be key as good data could weigh on the market in the\nshort-term on a hawkish repricing. </p><p>Lastly, we have the US-Iran\nmilitary escalation risk. This is one of the biggest risks because if a\nmilitary conflict were to break out, we would see oil prices skyrocket. This\nwould be a negative shock for the global economy and lead to stagflation risks.\nThe first reaction in the markets would be strong risk aversion. We would\nhighly likely see a selloff in the stock market as future growth expectations\nwould turn negative.</p><p>To sum up, there are lots\nof downside risks at the moment with little reasons for a rally into new\nall-time highs. Nonetheless, the macro backdrop remains positive given the\neasing inflation and improving labour market, but that could change quickly, so\ntraders will need to be careful.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe daily chart, we can see that\nthe S&amp;P 500 rebounded from the monthly\nlows and it’s approaching the all-time highs. If the price gets there, we can\nexpect the sellers to step in with a defined risk above the record highs, to\nposition for a drop back into the 6,760 support. The buyers, on the other hand,\nwill want to see the price breaking higher to increase the bullish bets into\nnew record highs.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On\nthe 4 hour chart, we have a\nstrong support zone around the 6,930 level. If we get a pullback, we can expect\nthe buyers to step in around the support with a defined risk below it to keep\npushing into new highs. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nlower to pile back in and target the 6,760 support. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">S&amp;P 500 TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup\naround the support, while the sellers will need a break lower to open the door\nfor a drop into the 6,760 support.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">The big story in the equities market came after the close yesterday, with Nvidia delivering a major beat in their earnings report across the board. That saw shares of the tech giant rose by over 3% for a brief period in after-hours trading before settling with more modest gains. In turn, broader market sentiment also retreated and that's making for a more tepid mood seen in Asia and early European morning trade thus far.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.1% currently, with Nasdaq futures also down 0.1% on the day. As we look to the open later, Nvidia shares are now seen up only 0.6% in pre-market. Even with a triple beat on revenue, earnings, and guidance, it's not quite doing enough to drag the ship up as we gear up towards the Wall Street open in a few hours.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">And the market saying is that <em>when something can't go up on good news, it surely means that there is danger up ahead</em>.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">That being said, it would be remiss of me not to point out that investors tend to put Nvidia up on an extremely high pedestal when it comes to earnings releases. And this time is no exception to that.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">When perfection is the bare minimum, Nvidia's latest earnings beat is pretty much what investors would really want to see with the poster boy of the AI rally. So when perfection is very much expected, the exemplary tends to become ordinary. And one can argue that is what we're seeing here.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">All that being said, the more tepid mood belies the fact that the S&amp;P 500 is still just 0.8% away from reaching fresh record highs. And the Nasdaq is also bucking the technical downside break earlier this month to climb back up to its 100-day moving average - hitting a two-week high.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">There are definitely still macro concerns with regards to geopolitics and trade, alongside software stocks still being hounded by the AI disruption. All of that is certainly going to make for more cautious steps in the short-term. But if you go by the charts alone, it certainly doesn't feel like equities are in any sense of danger.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Yet, there's still that lingering feeling that the AI disruption and Nvidia having to shoulder such a heavy weight can only go so far before a correction is due. There are growing concerns on how the hyperscalers i.e. Google, Meta, Microsoft can keep up on capex spending to support the outlook portrayed by Nvidia. And that adds to the prevailing narrative that software stocks are being heavily pushed down now by the same very AI disruption that Nvidia is powering.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Can big tech prove to be enough to do the heavy lifting if the rest of the market struggles? That might be the key juncture we're at when viewing the latest developments.</p>",

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oil prices stabilized after last week’s sharp surge, which was driven by\nfears of a possible military escalation over the weekend. Attention is now\nturning to the third round of US–Iran nuclear talks taking place in Geneva\ntoday. Based on the developments so far, the prospects for an\nagreement appear slim. In fact, the signals we are getting are actually concerning.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US has reportedly built up a significant military presence in the\nMiddle East, the largest deployment in the region since the 2003 invasion of\nIraq. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has prepared a contingency plan to\nboost short-term oil production and exports if a potential US strike on Iran\nwere to disrupt crude flows from the region. At the same time, reports suggest\nthat Iran is close to finalizing a deal to purchase supersonic anti-ship\nmissiles from China, although any deployment would not be immediate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a military conflict were to break out, oil prices would likely spike\nsharply, particularly due to the risk of disruption in the Strait of Hormuz, a\ncritical chokepoint for global energy supplies. Conversely, a clear sign of US\nmilitary de-escalation or a breakthrough in negotiations between Washington and\nTehran would likely be needed for prices to retreat toward the $60 level.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, elevated geopolitical tensions are expected to keep the oil market supported.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">CRUDE OIL\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that crude oil stabilised around the 66.43 level as traders turned their\nfocus to the third round of US-Iran nuclear talks before picking a direction. We\ncan expect the sellers to continue to step in around the 66.43 resistance with\na defined risk above it to target a drop back into the 62.36 support. The\nbuyers, on the other hand, will look for a break higher to increase the bullish\nbets into the 70.50 level next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 4 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 4 hour chart, we\nhave also a mid-range support around the 64.14 level where aggressive\ndip-buyers could step in. The sellers, on the other hand, will look for a break\nbelow that level to increase the bearish bets into the 62.36 support next.</p><h2>CRUDE OIL TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, we\nhave a minor downward trendline defining the bearish momentum on this timeframe.\nThe sellers will likely continue to lean on the trendline with a defined risk\nabove it to keep pushing into new lows, while the buyers will look for a break\nhigher to pile in for a rally into new highs.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">It's nice to wrap up the trading week with it being the final day of the month. And interestingly enough, did you realise that the March calendar is a repeat of February (only with the additional 3 days). In February trading, the dollar has been rather resilient after struggling towards the end of last year. However, the mood has been a bit shaky in the second half of the month.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Geopolitical uncertainty and trade policy uncertainty are two big issues that are plaguing the greenback. No thanks to the erratic policy handling by the US administration of course. And that's keeping precious metals underpinned amid the continued currency debasement narrative since last year.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">As for the dollar itself, that is putting the currency on the rocks as it looks vulnerable to a renewed drop heading into March. But in closing out February trading, Credit Agricole argues that the dollar could find support from month-end flows in at least holding its head above water in the final few days here.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>\"On the structural side, concerns about rebalancing out of the US remain a drag on the USD and support EUR/USD. The latest spike of US trade policy risks seems to support the bearish USD-view as FX investors shun the US policy and economic uncertainty. In addition, valuation concerns erode the appeal of USD assets.</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>That said, we also note that the more recent USD recovery has coincided with US stock market weakness. This may suggest that the USD is benefitting from the unwinding of short-USD hedges that foreign investors have put into place. <strong>Our month-end rebalancing model predicts that they will continue to buy USD this week</strong>.\"</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">Just something to take note of as we move into the closing stages of the week in the next two days. In particular, just be wary of any volatility bouts when we get to the London fix especially.</p>",

Bitcoin CME Futures are currently hovering right around <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"204\">$68,185, </strong>pulling back a bit by 1.91%, or roughly $1,330, on the day. If you're watching the charts today, the immediate range is pretty tight, you've got support holding near the daily low of <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"398\">$67,965</strong> and resistance capping things off around the session high of <strong data-path-to-node=\"0\" data-index-in-node=\"467\">$69,195</strong>.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">But to really understand the technical setup, you have to zoom out. Sure, we’re seeing a spark of short-term momentum with a <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"125\">3.11%</strong> pop over the last week, but that little victory is fighting against a brutal longer-term downtrend. We're still down <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"249\">23%</strong> year-to-date and nursing a painful nearly <strong>40</strong>% drop over the last six months (!). </p><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">When you compare this recent weekly bounce to those heavy multi-month losses, especially considering we're miles away from the 52-week high of $127,240, it becomes obvious just how critical these current price levels are. The big question now is whether this is just a fleeting relief rally, or the actual groundwork for a real, sustained reversal.</p><h3 data-path-to-node=\"0\">Ethereum's 20% Surge Activates a Major Bull Flag — Now the Real Test Begins</h3><p data-path-to-node=\"1\">Ethereum is stealing the spotlight right now, officially outpacing Bitcoin yesteraday after an explosive rally that sent prices soaring roughly 20% since Thursday morning. Looking at the 1-hour Ether Futures chart, the technical setup is incredibly compelling: the price successfully broke out of its lengthy descending channel, decisively activating a textbook bull flag. Currently trading around the <strong data-path-to-node=\"1\" data-index-in-node=\"392\">$2,061.0</strong> mark following a minor intraday pullback, the mission for buyers is crystal clear. Bulls absolutely must step up and defend the upper boundary of this previously broken flag, turning former resistance into new support. If they can successfully hold this line, the bullish technical narrative remains completely intact, paving the way for the market's next leg up. But bulls can not fully celebrate yet and I explain why below.</p><h2 data-start=\"557\" data-end=\"619\">The daily view: rebound energy is fading into consolidation</h2><h3 data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"672\">Bitcoin futures daily: rebound, then hesitation</h3><p data-start=\"673\" data-end=\"837\">On the daily timeframe, BTC looks like it successfully defended a downside extension, then ran into supply and began to stall. That usually means one of two things:</p><ol data-start=\"839\" data-end=\"976\"><li data-start=\"839\" data-end=\"892\"><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"892\">The market is building a base to continue higher</p></li><li data-start=\"893\" data-end=\"976\"><p data-start=\"896\" data-end=\"976\">The rebound was mostly short-covering and it will fade once buyers stop pressing</p></li></ol><p data-start=\"978\" data-end=\"1135\">The key daily takeaway is simple: the bounce happened, but the market still needs proof that it can reclaim and hold higher prices rather than just tag them.</p><h3 data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1200\">Ether futures daily: similar story, slightly weaker posture</h3><p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1547\">ETH is in the same “rebound then pause” regime, but with a slightly more fragile feel because it is repeatedly reacting around a psychologically important area near $2,000. When a market hovers around a major round number after a rebound, it tends to behave like a magnet. It pulls price in both directions until one side finally wins acceptance.</p><p data-start=\"1549\" data-end=\"1699\">Educational note: round numbers like $2,000 and $70,000 are not magic, but they attract liquidity. That liquidity can amplify fakeouts and fast moves.</p><h2 data-start=\"1706\" data-end=\"1767\">The 4H footprint view: what the market is saying right now</h2><p data-start=\"1769\" data-end=\"1872\">When you zoom into the 4H footprint sequence, you can see the “story of effort vs result” more clearly.</p><h3 data-start=\"1874\" data-end=\"1922\">BTC 4H: push, rejection, then low-delta chop</h3><p data-start=\"1923\" data-end=\"2110\">BTC printed a clean expansion higher, then got hit with a meaningful response sell bar. After that, the more recent bars show very small delta and smaller participation. That often means:</p><ul data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2280\"><li data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2176\"><p data-start=\"2114\" data-end=\"2176\">Sellers took a shot and did not immediately get follow-through</p></li><li data-start=\"2177\" data-end=\"2228\"><p data-start=\"2179\" data-end=\"2228\">Buyers are not aggressively lifting offers either</p></li><li data-start=\"2229\" data-end=\"2280\"><p data-start=\"2231\" data-end=\"2280\">The market is rotating into balance, not trending</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"2282\" data-end=\"2452\">Educational note: low delta during sideways price action is often a “wait state.” The next break can be sharp because liquidity builds up while participation looks quiet.</p><h3 data-start=\"2454\" data-end=\"2521\">ETH 4H: rejection had more teeth, stabilization attempt follows</h3><p data-start=\"2522\" data-end=\"2841\">ETH also had the impulse higher, but its rejection bar looks more forceful and the stabilization is less convincing. The good news for bulls is that sell pressure appears to cool after the rejection. The challenge is that ETH still needs to reclaim overhead zones to prove that the rebound is turning into continuation.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"3087\">Educational note: a strong rejection followed by shrinking negative delta is a common early stabilization pattern. It is not a reversal signal by itself. It is a “pressure is reducing” signal that still needs confirmation from price acceptance.</p><h2 data-start=\"3094\" data-end=\"3149\">Key zones traders keep reacting to (why they matter)</h2><p data-start=\"3151\" data-end=\"3304\">You can think of these as “acceptance tests.” The market often wicks into them, but what matters is whether price can hold and build above or below them.</p><h3 data-start=\"3306\" data-end=\"3325\">Bitcoin futures</h3><ul data-start=\"3326\" data-end=\"3458\"><li data-start=\"3326\" data-end=\"3373\"><p data-start=\"3328\" data-end=\"3373\">Overhead supply zone: roughly $68,750-$69,000</p></li><li data-start=\"3374\" data-end=\"3411\"><p data-start=\"3376\" data-end=\"3411\">First support area: roughly $67,750</p></li><li data-start=\"3412\" data-end=\"3458\"><p data-start=\"3414\" data-end=\"3458\">Deeper support area: roughly $67,200-$66,700</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3460\" data-end=\"3706\">Why it matters: BTC is currently doing business in a range where both sides are probing. Acceptance above the overhead supply zone shifts odds toward continuation. Acceptance below the deeper support zone shifts odds toward a fade of the rebound.</p><h3 data-start=\"3708\" data-end=\"3725\">Ether futures</h3><ul data-start=\"3726\" data-end=\"3850\"><li data-start=\"3726\" data-end=\"3771\"><p data-start=\"3728\" data-end=\"3771\">Overhead supply zone: roughly $2,075-$2,100</p></li><li data-start=\"3772\" data-end=\"3815\"><p data-start=\"3774\" data-end=\"3815\">First support area: roughly $2,055-$2,045</p></li><li data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"3850\"><p data-start=\"3818\" data-end=\"3850\">Major psychological line: $2,000</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3852\" data-end=\"4114\">Why it matters: $2,000 is a liquidity magnet. Markets often whip around these levels. A clean hold above the overhead zone improves the bull case. Sustained trade below $2,000 tends to change sentiment quickly because it signals that the rebound failed to stick.</p><h2 data-start=\"4121\" data-end=\"4184\">What “sustained acceptance” actually means </h2><p data-start=\"4185\" data-end=\"4261\">A lot of traders get chopped up because they treat one wick as confirmation.</p><p data-start=\"4263\" data-end=\"4293\">A more disciplined definition:</p><ul data-start=\"4294\" data-end=\"4436\"><li data-start=\"4294\" data-end=\"4333\"><p data-start=\"4296\" data-end=\"4333\">One spike through a level is a test</p></li><li data-start=\"4334\" data-end=\"4385\"><p data-start=\"4336\" data-end=\"4385\">Multiple closes holding the level is acceptance</p></li><li data-start=\"4386\" data-end=\"4436\"><p data-start=\"4388\" data-end=\"4436\">Acceptance plus follow-through is confirmation</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4438\" data-end=\"4530\">This matters because both BTC and ETH are currently in conditions where fakeouts are common.</p><h2 data-start=\"4537\" data-end=\"4585\">Practical takeaways for crypto traders and investors</h2><h3 data-start=\"4587\" data-end=\"4606\">For day traders</h3><ul data-start=\"4607\" data-end=\"4851\"><li data-start=\"4607\" data-end=\"4685\"><p data-start=\"4609\" data-end=\"4685\">Expect chop until the market proves acceptance above or below the key zones.</p></li><li data-start=\"4686\" data-end=\"4761\"><p data-start=\"4688\" data-end=\"4761\">In balance regimes, getting “married to direction” tends to be expensive.</p></li><li data-start=\"4762\" data-end=\"4851\"><p data-start=\"4764\" data-end=\"4851\">Focus on reaction quality: does price hold above the reclaim, or snap back immediately?</p></li></ul><h3 data-start=\"4853\" data-end=\"4888\">For swing traders and investors</h3><ul data-start=\"4889\" data-end=\"5202\"><li data-start=\"4889\" data-end=\"4977\"><p data-start=\"4891\" data-end=\"4977\">This is still a post-rebound digestion phase. That can resolve higher, or it can fade.</p></li><li data-start=\"4978\" data-end=\"5075\"><p data-start=\"4980\" data-end=\"5075\">You want to see the market build value higher over time, not just print one strong rebound day.</p></li><li data-start=\"5076\" data-end=\"5202\"><p data-start=\"5078\" data-end=\"5202\">If you are positioning longer-term, the best signal is usually not the first push, it is the ability to hold after the push.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"5209\" data-end=\"5223\">Crypto followers should now stay patient and watch the key price levels</h2><p data-start=\"5224\" data-end=\"5382\">Daily says: the rebound is real, but it is stalling under supply.<br data-start=\"5289\" data-end=\"5292\">\n4H says: BTC is stalling in balance, ETH is stalling with a slightly stronger rejection.</p><p data-start=\"5224\" data-end=\"5382\"><strong data-start=\"3185\" data-end=\"3243\">If 4H stays constructive while daily is still bearish:</strong> expect chop and sharp swings.

From a risk management\nperspective, the sellers will have a better risk to reward setup around the\n1.1927 level to position for a drop into the 1.16 handle next.

The buyers will likely step in around the 1.1807 support with\na defined risk below it to extend the rally into the 1.1850 resistance.
