BOJ Ueda said that there is no pre-set about timing of the next rate hike which assuaged the markets fear for higher rates sooner rather than later.  Ueda also said Japan’s economy is <strong data-start=\"52\" data-end=\"109\">recovering moderately but still showing some weakness</strong>, with <strong data-start=\"116\" data-end=\"167\">easy monetary policy expected to support growth</strong>. He noted that <strong data-start=\"183\" data-end=\"231\">economic expansion will likely remain modest</strong> due to trade-related slowdowns and weaker overseas demand but should improve as global economies stabilize. Ueda expects <strong data-start=\"353\" data-end=\"412\">next year’s wage hikes to align with this year’s levels</strong> and emphasized the importance of <strong data-start=\"446\" data-end=\"486\">closely monitoring wage negotiations</strong>, especially in the auto sector affected by tariffs.

On energy, Bessent said both nations are focused on <strong data-start=\"1192\" data-end=\"1221\">nuclear power development</strong>, with the U.S. still behind China but working to close the gap. He also warned that the <strong data-start=\"1310\" data-end=\"1338\">U.S. government shutdown</strong> is beginning to drag on the economy, costing an estimated <strong data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"1421\">$15 billion per week</strong>.</p><p>Finally, China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that Beijing and Washington agreed to extend certain tariff exemptions and pause several trade-related measures for one year. The U.S. will continue suspending its <strong data-start=\"200\" data-end=\"226\">24% reciprocal tariffs</strong> for another year, while China will <strong data-start=\"262\" data-end=\"303\">suspend shipbuilding-related measures</strong> against the U.S. for the same period. Both sides also reached a <strong data-start=\"368\" data-end=\"405\">consensus on fentanyl cooperation</strong> and on <strong data-start=\"413\" data-end=\"445\">expanding agricultural trade</strong>.

Trump as usual tried to play it up, calling the meeting \"amazing\" and rating it a \"12 out of 10\" meetup between the two leaders. But as the dust settles, it seems that all we're reverting to is back to the regular scheduled programming from before October.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">China pledged to hold off rare earth export controls, for now at least, while stepping up agricultural purchases - in particular soybeans. On the latter, it wouldn't be the first time that promise is made and broken, as we have seen dating all the way back to 2018. So, I wouldn't hold my breath on this being a change in China's game plan.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">It seems that the idea by Beijing is to ride out the Trump storm and they at least will get through a quarter of the way there by the end of this year.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">On the US side, they agreed to lower fentanyl tariffs by 10% and that brings China tariffs down to 47% from 57% before. And that's about it really.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The risk mood was more tentative as investors are not quite feeling all too bullish about the meeting aftermath. Of course, Wall Street might have other ideas later but Nvidia's Blackwell chips were completely ignored during the meeting so that's a bit of a setback.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">US futures didn't get up to much, hovering near unchanged levels and being marginally lower or higher during the session. Meanwhile, European indices are holding lower with month-end shenanigans also in play.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In the major currencies space, the Japanese yen is the big mover as it tumbled after BOJ governor Ueda's press conference. Ueda kept resorting to making excuses in not confirming any rate hike plans, pointing to US tariffs to wanting to wait for more data and also the spring wage negotiations next year to be more assured. That despite him denying that Takaichi's premiership is an influence to the central bank's thinking. Pfft.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">USD/JPY surged higher from 153.10 to break to its highest levels since February, climbing all the way past 154.00 now and up nearly 1% on the day.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The rise is also helped slightly by a firmer dollar, with the greenback keeping steadier across the board after the overnight gains on a less dovish Fed.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">In other markets, gold tried once again to climb above the $4,000 mark but is met by resistance from key near-term levels and that is keeping things in check for dip buyers on the day so far.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">It's on to the ECB next and also looking at how market players will take to the Trump-Xi meeting aftermath. But don't forget, month-end flows will also have the potential to make things a bit messy as we look to round off the week tomorrow. I'll be off on Friday but if you're attending TCGKL this weekend, you might be able to spot me there. Have a good one, everybody!</p>",

            "title": "The Importance Of Crypto Literacy In 2025",
            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrency has moved from the domain of coders to determining the future of retirement funds, corporate payments, and finance in general. Yet most people don’t know what a blockchain is or why scammers want your seed phrase. Fast forward to 2025, and the distinction between wallets and exchanges, an understanding of “tokenomics,” and regulatory awareness allow the average user to look out for their own interests and identify opportunities in a market driven by hype.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Role of Crypto Literacy Today</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto rails can open new opportunities for payments, remittances, and savings, particularly where traditional banking is costly or not offered at all. You no longer need a bank to send money home, save for the future, or start a business. You just need a smartphone. For millions of people, that’s a shift in thegame.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is still a hotbed for scams, be it phishing texts, false “support” accounts, or an all-of-the-sudden “rug pull” where a token disappears post social media pump. Private key compromises accounted for the largest share (43.8%) of stolen crypto. Literacy means recognizing the red flags before you lose your money.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Gone are the days when you could simply follow the latest trending coin. Today, it’s critical for everyone, rather than just day traders, to understand how trading fees function, what assets are being locked, and how to use a blockchain explorer. For example, when new tokens launch on major exchanges, some traders jump in without checking fundamentals, leading to potential losses. That’s why it’s important to consult reliable sources, such as these <a href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/new-binance-listings/\">best Binance new listings</a>, which provide verified information on newly listed tokens and their details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Major changes are underway in crypto regulation. The GENIUS Act now requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets, while the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is reshaping how the SEC and CFTC oversee digital assets. These developments highlight why crypto users must stay informed.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Policy and Corporate Adoption: More Choice, More Risk</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Retirement Policy:</strong><br>The White House signed an order on August 7, 2025, allowing 401K access to crypto and nontraditional assets. Proponents say it’s a boon for diversification, while detractors worry about increased fees, legal hassles, and dangerous volatility. Where both sides are correct: Americans need legitimate crypto education before changing their retirement plan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Market Moves:</strong><br>This month, policy tailwinds and regulatory headwinds have sent bitcoin prices soaring to new all-time highs, but there are reasons why the bull market shouldn’t result in a bulls-only mentality. Savers who do not understand the risks of volatility, liquidity traps, and custody quirks will chase returns and end in regret.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Corporate Adoption:</strong><br>Tesla is noted for its back-and-forth crypto policies. The company briefly accepted bitcoin as payment for cars before reversing this decision 49 days later. However, you can still <a href=\"https://cryptoprocessing.com/learn/who-accepts-dogecoin\">purchase Tesla merch using Dogecoin</a>. Companies change policies rapidly, and verifying and double-checking has become a necessary skill.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges That Raise the Stakes</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most fundamental problems regarding crypto is a lack of knowledge. Many users do not fully understand private keys, seed phrases, or even wallet security at a high level, and keep their funds on exchanges, ceding control and risking losing them if the company collapses. The regulatory environment is also fragmented as law depends on the state or country. The hype by these “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-025-00947-1\">crypto influencers</a>” is questionable and can mislead newcomers. Fact-checking and source-checking are critical. Those looking to venture into crypto need to have an understanding of volatility, fees, and custody prior to converting long-term savings into crypto or any other volatile assets.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Building Your Crypto Knowledge: The Essentials</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">1.      Wallets &amp; Keys: Know the difference between “hot” online wallets and “cold” hardware storage. Never share your seed phrase; not even with customer support.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2.      Exchanges: Learn how centralized exchanges handle withdrawals, charge fees, and what liquidity “depth” means for your order size.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3.      Tokenomics &amp; Events: Emissions, vesting schedules, governance votes, and major exchange listings can all change asset value overnight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4.      Security: Recognize common scams - phishing messages, fake websites, and malicious contract approvals. Revoke permissions when in doubt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5.      Regulatory Changes: Keep up with U.S. policy on retirement accounts, IRS rules, and make sure your broker provides plain-English disclosures.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6.      Begin with government publications, policies (rather than headlines or social media), and look for coverage in non-partisan, neutral news sources for any market-moving news.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Way Forward: Access With Education</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">New crypto alternatives should have resources and guides that clearly explain them. Concepts such as wallets, custody, and market structure should be taught in personal finance education. Resources should provide concise overviews of risks, fees, and custody, with disclosures matching the protections offered to experienced investors in traditional investments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is more mainstream, but having access is not enough. Literacy is what prevents investors from unnecessary losses. Only invest what you understand, be curious, learn the basics, and inquire. This is the appropriate kind of digital financial safeguard these days, overall responsible participation.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The ECB policy decision today is expected to be the most boring one out of all the central bank decisions we had this week. </p><h2>STATEMENT</h2><p>The ECB is expected to keep interest rates unchanged leaving the policy rate at 2.00%, which is right in the middle of their estimated neutral range (1.75%-2.25%). There shouldn't be any change in the statement and we won't get economic projections. </p><h2>PRESS CONFERENCE</h2><p>In the press conference, ECB President Lagarde is very unlikely to add anything new and reiterate that they are \"in a good place\", that they are \"not pre-committing to any particular rate path\" and that they will follow a \"data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach\".</p><h2>RECENT COMMUNICATION</h2><p>This has been repeated over and over again by many ECB members in the past weeks with the core message being that they are fine with the current policy setting and that they won't react to small or short-term deviations from their 2% inflation target. Some of them even added that the next move could be a rate cut or a rate hike, so they are really just monitoring the economic developments into 2026. </p><h2>RECENT DATA</h2><p>The economic data since the last meeting has been consistent with their projections. The core inflation rate ticked higher recently, while the unemployment rate held steady. We also got some very strong Eurozone PMIs last week. Therefore, the ECB should be happy in maintaining the status quo. The ECB has been certainly the most successful central bank in this cycle as they brought inflation back to target without an increase in the unemployment rate or a significant slowdown in the economy. </p><h2>MARKET PRICING</h2><ul><li>Today's cut: 1% probability</li><li>December cut: 5% probability</li><li>Total easing by the end of 2026: 12 bps (less than 50% probability)</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">Dip buyers tried for a run back above $4,000 yesterday only to fall short but in trading today, they are once again showing some appetite as we get into European trading. The difference now though is that we're seeing price action move up to test the 100-hour moving average (red line). That's the first real test of any of the key hourly moving averages since the heavy selling pressure from last Tuesday.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">It's a key near-term level to watch as the battlefield starts to heat up in gold. Keep below the 100-hour moving average and the near-term bias stays more bearish. But break above, and dip buyers are let back into the game in holding a more neutral near-term bias with room to roam. The 200-hour moving average (blue line) is only seen at $4,096 currently.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The meeting between Trump and Xi went well but at the end of the day, it seems to be a case of <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/news/trump-xi-meeting-just-about-covers-the-dots-but-was-it-really-amazing-20251030/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">much ado about nothing</a>. The major takeaway is that both sides are avoiding any further escalation in trade tensions but after all the noise, it's mostly just a reversion back to the status quo before October.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">The market optimism remains very much in check today with S&amp;P 500 futures down 0.1% for the time being.

            "title": "USDJPY Technical Analysis: Fed's Powell sounds hawkish while BoJ stays neutral",
            "description": "<h2><strong>Fundamental Overview</strong></h2><p>The USD strengthened across\nthe board yesterday following a hawkish comment from Fed Chair Powell. In fact,\nthe Fed decision was in line with expectations but the only thing that mattered\nis one line from Powell saying “a December cut is not a foregone conclusion –\nin fact, far from it”. </p><p>He repeated that a few\ntimes suggesting that there’s really a strong debate within the FOMC. Remember\nthat the neutral and hawkish members outnumber the dovish members easily. Of\ncourse, everything is conditional to the data, but Powell also added that in\ncase they don’t get the data, they might as well skip the December cut.</p><p>We saw bit of a hawkish\nrepricing in interest rate expectations with the December probability falling\nto 70% vs 90% before Powell’s speech. The total easing by the end of 2026 shows\n87 bps which is still too dovish compared to 50 bps expected by the Fed.</p><p>On the JPY side, the currency weakened across the board as the BoJ\nleft interest rates unchanged as expected with again two dissenters voting for\na hike. There were no surprises. BoJ governor Ueda offered limited forward\nguidance as he mostly repeated the same stuff highlighting trade uncertainty\nand focus on spring wage negotiations. The market pricing turned a little bit\nmore dovish as the probability for a December hike fell to just 26% with the next\nhike expected in March 2026 at the earliest. </p><h2><strong>USDJPY\nTechnical Analysis – Daily Timeframe</strong></h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that USDJPY is breaking above the resistance around the 153.25 level where\nwe have the confluence of the previous high and the top trendline. The buyers likely increased the bullish bets to target a move into the 154.80 level\nnext. The sellers, on the other hand, will want to see the price falling back\nbelow the resistance to step back in and position for a pullback into the\n151.00 support. </p><h2><strong>USDJPY Technical\nAnalysis – 4 hour Timeframe</strong></h2><p>On the 4 hour chart, we can\nsee more clearly the current breakout. There’s not much else we can add here as\nthe buyers piled in on the breakout to target the 154.80 level, while the sellers\nwill look for a fall back below the resistance to position for a pullback. </p><h2><strong>USDJPY Technical\nAnalysis – 1 hour Timeframe</strong></h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, we can\nsee that we have a couple of upward trendlines defining the bullish momentum.\nIf the price gets there, we can expect the buyers to lean on the trendlines\nwith a defined risk below them to position for a rally into new highs. The\nsellers, on the other hand, will look for downside breaks to increase the\nbearish bets into the 151.00 support.  The\nred lines define the <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/Education/trading-tip-know-the-average-daily-range-adr-20220207/\">average daily range</a> for today.</p><h2><strong>Upcoming\nCatalysts</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://investinglive.com/EconomicCalendar\">Tomorrow</a> we conclude the week with the Tokyo CPI.</p>",
