            "description": "<p data-path-to-node=\"3\">U.S. equity futures are under pressure this morning, with the Nasdaq (NQ) and S&amp;P 500 (ES) both down 0.9%, while the Russell 2000 (RTY) is lagging further with a 1.3% drop. While the \"Magnificent 7\" are seeing modest declines led by Microsoft (-2.5%), the real story is a violent resumption of selling in the software sector.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">Investors are increasingly wary of companies transitioning their business models toward AI, punishing any signs of slowing growth or margin compression in exchange for long-term AI positioning.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">On CNBC this morning, they ran a pair of comments from software markers highlighting how \"something changed\" in December with regards to the capability of models in replacing coders. One of those was Block, which is up 15% today after laying off 40% of staff. Everyone is taking that as a sign of what's to come.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">The software sector is seeing some of its sharpest single-day declines of the year, driven by a \"show-me\" attitude from investors regarding AI monetization.</p><ul data-path-to-node=\"8\"><li><p data-path-to-node=\"8,0,0\">Duolingo (DUOL) -27%: The language-learning giant is the morning's biggest casualty. Despite beating Q4 numbers, the stock is cratering on weak 2026 guidance. Management is pivoting toward a \"growth over profit\" strategy, investing heavily in free-user experience and AI features (like Video Call) to scale to 100 million DAUs. The market, however, is fixated on the projected EBITDA margin compression (from 29.5% to 25%) and slowing bookings growth.</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"8,1,0\">Zscaler (ZS) -13%: Even a \"beat and raise\" wasn't enough for the cybersecurity firm. While ZS topped estimates, investors were disappointed by the organic growth metrics. Much of the upside was attributed to the Red Canary acquisition rather than core organic acceleration, sparking fears of a \"growth ceiling\" in a crowded security market.</p></li><li><p data-path-to-node=\"8,2,0\">Intuit (INTU) -3.1%: The financial software leader posted a robust quarter with 17% revenue growth, but a disappointing outlook for the upcoming quarter has weighed on shares. Investors are cautious about the high debt load used to fund AI initiatives and the slower-than-expected return to double-digit growth for the Mailchimp segment.</p></li></ul><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">While \"SaaS\" (Software as a Service) is struggling, the \"Picks and Shovels\" of AI continue to show diverging paths based on their balance sheets. </p><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">Today's winner is Dell, up 11% on stellar Q4 results fueled by a massive backlog in AI servers. Dell remains a primary beneficiary of the hardware build-out.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">On the flip side, CoreWeave is down 11.5% on a wider than expected loss and $30 billion capex plan.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">Finally, NFLX shares are up 8.6% after bowing out of the race for Warner Brothers and taking a $2.8 billion break fee.</p>",

Monday’s high at <strong data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"977\">1.1834</strong> reinforces this resistance zone.

            "description": "<p class=\"text-align-justify\">While a lot of focus on the BOJ is turning to the outcome of the spring wage negotiations in the weeks ahead, ANZ is one to argue that the bigger picture outlook might be one that limits the scope for the central bank to stay on the tightening path. And the firm argues that it won't be from a shake up of the BOJ board nor pressure from the government. Instead, it is the very nature of inflation dynamics in Japan.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">ANZ forecasts that inflation pressures in Japan will begin to soften this year and are looking for core prices to ease back down towards the 2% level. As such, that will challenge the BOJ mandate of having to be able to \"sustain\" core inflation at that threshold. The firm notes that:</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>\"There is much to consider in Japan’s economic outlook. However, in coming months we expect domestic economic conditions will be consistent with gradual disinflation through 2026. Headline Consumer Price Index inflation was 1.5% y/y in January, and we forecast it will average 1.7% this year. We expect core inflation (2.4% y/y) will come down gradually, closer to 2.0%. We are of the view that the BOJ needs to proceed cautiously with respect to further tightening.</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\"><em>We forecast only one more 25 bps rate rise this year, as Japan gradually moves away from the zero lower bound, taking the policy rate to 1.00%.\"</em></p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">That's slightly on the conservative side as opposed to market pricing, with traders currently seeing ~46 bps of rate hikes from the BOJ by year-end.</p><p class=\"text-align-justify\">If there is really going to be just one more rate hike left by the BOJ, they might want to get a move on with <a href=\"https://investinglive.com/centralbank/boj-up-against-the-clock-in-delivering-the-next-rate-hike-20260226/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow\">the opportunity window likely to narrow further</a> once we get past March and even more so after June.</p>",

Regarding separate bi-lateral deals, he said there have\nalways been bilateral arrangements between the three countries. </p><p>The signals have been\nmixed, but overall, slightly positive. The market is pricing some chances of a\nrate cut by year-end but those remain low. The economic data has been\nsupportive of such stance with the labour market stabilising and core inflation\nhovering a bit above the 2.5% mid-point of the BoC 2-3% target range. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">USDCAD TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that USDCAD pulled all the way back to the monthly high around the 1.3725\nlevel and stalled as the market got stuck in a consolidation.

Later in the day, however, new\nheadlines indicated that the discussions had actually made significant progress\nand that another round was scheduled for next week. The prices pulled back on\nthe news but eventually rebounded as traders hedged into the weekend risk as\nyou never know with Trump. This kind of back-and-forth is keeping the market\nrangebound near the highs with a bullish skew.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a military conflict were to erupt, oil prices would likely spike\nsharply, particularly due to the risk of disruption in the Strait of Hormuz, a\ncritical chokepoint for global energy supplies. Conversely, a clear sign of US\nmilitary de-escalation or a breakthrough in negotiations between Washington and\nTehran would likely be needed for prices to retreat toward the $60 level. For now, elevated geopolitical tensions are expected to keep the oil market\nwell supported.</p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">CRUDE OIL\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that crude oil continues to consolidate around the highs as US-Iran tensions\npersist. We can expect the sellers to continue to step in around the 66.43\nresistance with a defined risk above it to target a drop back into the 62.36\nsupport.

            "description": "<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">FUNDAMENTAL\nOVERVIEW</h2><p>The Nasdaq sold off\nyesterday after early reports suggested the third round of US–Iran talks had\nbroken down, with Iran reportedly rejecting US demands. Later in the day,\nhowever, new headlines indicated that the discussions had actually made\nsignificant progress and that another round was scheduled for next week. This\nkind of back-and-forth on the macro and geopolitical front is keeping most\nmarkets rangebound.</p><p>Right now, the main risks\nfor the Nasdaq are a potential US–Iran military escalation and a hawkish\nrepricing of Fed interest rate expectations.</p><p>On the rates side, the\nmarket is still pricing in about 57 bps of easing by year-end. This outlook could\nbe at risk of a hawkish repricing on further improvement in the US labour\nmarket data. In fact, Fed Governor Waller said that he would consider holding\nrates steady if we see another strong NFP report like January’s. That makes\nnext Friday’s data especially important as solid numbers could weigh on\nequities in the short term as traders dial back expectations for rate cuts.</p><p>The bigger risk, though, is\ngeopolitical. If a military conflict between the US and Iran were to break out,\noil prices would likely surge. That would represent a negative shock to the\nglobal economy and raise stagflation concerns. The initial market reaction\nwould almost certainly be a sharp move toward risk aversion, with equities\nselling off hard as growth expectations deteriorate. </p><p>To sum up, there are lots\nof downside risks at the moment with little reasons for a rally into new\nall-time highs. The macro backdrop remains broadly supportive, with easing\ninflation and a resilient labour market, but that picture could shift quickly.

We now have an upward trendline defining\nthe bullish structure on this timeframe. The buyers will likely lean on the\ntrendline with a defined risk below the 24,700 support to keep pushing into new\nhighs, while the sellers will look for a break below the trendline and the\nsupport to increase the bearish bets into the 24,200 level next. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">NASDAQ TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – 1 HOUR TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the 1 hour chart, there’s\nnot much we can add here as the buyers will have a better risk to reward setup\naround the trendline and the 24,700 support, but another break above the 25,127\ncould see the buyers piling in for a move back into the 25,500 level.

Yesterday,\nit looked like the third round of US-Iran talks went bad as we got reports of\nIran rejecting US demands. The markets went into risk-off, eventually\nsupporting gold prices. </p><p>Later on, we got reports\nthat the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-iran-nuclear-talks-resume-geneva-against-backdrop-military-threat-2026-02-26/\">talks\nmade significant progress</a> and another round was scheduled for next week. This\npush and pull is keeping most market rangebound, including gold. </p><p>Overall, the market might\nremain supported in the short-term amid some uncertainty, but I don’t see\nmaterial changes to justify a rally back to all-time highs, at the moment. The\nreal risks remain a potential US-Iran military escalation which could take gold\nprices to new highs or a hawkish repricing on stronger US data which would have\na negative effect on the market. </p><p>Fed’s Waller mentioned that\nhe would change his dovish stance in case the strong January’s jobs data is\nrepeated in February, so next week’s NFP report is going to be a key risk event\nfor gold. </p><h2 class=\"MsoNormal\">GOLD TECHNICAL\nANALYSIS – DAILY TIMEFRAME</h2><p>On the daily chart, we can\nsee that gold is creeping higher, but the momentum remains weak with many\nconsolidations along the way.
