Economists said the outflows could tighten local liquidity and weaken the won, which has already been one of Asia’s poorest performers this year.</p><p data-start=\"666\" data-end=\"819\">Citigroup expects the currency to fall toward ₩1,450 per dollar over the next year as pension funds and corporates continue building U.S. exposure.</p><p data-start=\"821\" data-end=\"1103\">Still, markets welcomed the deal’s clarity: the Kospi hit fresh record highs, led by gains in autos, shipbuilders, and chipmakers. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan said reduced tariff uncertainty could drive the index above 5,000 points over the coming year.</p>",

            "description": "<p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"88\">PIMCO: Fed pushes back on market rate-cut bets, stays data-dependent amid shutdown</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"622\"><a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/us/en/insights/fed-delivers-despite-data-drought?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=yq25q4-lmamer-cpmarket_outlook_insights-moawareness-isna&amp;utm_content=cnfed_update_2025_x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">PIMCO</a> said the Federal Reserve’s latest 25-basis-point rate cut to a 3.75%–4.00% target range was largely anticipated, but Chair Jerome Powell’s effort to rein in market expectations for another move in December was the real story of the October meeting. The bond manager said Powell’s message that further cuts are “not a foregone conclusion” successfully cooled overconfident rate-cut bets, with the market-implied probability of a December cut falling from more than 90% to about 70% following the press conference.</p><p data-start=\"624\" data-end=\"995\">The Fed’s policy statement itself was little changed, reflecting a cautious approach amid a lack of economic data caused by the U.S. government shutdown. PIMCO noted Powell’s reliance on alternative indicators such as state-level jobless claims and private job openings, which have remained stable, suggesting the labor market may be more resilient than feared.</p><p data-start=\"997\" data-end=\"1386\">At the same time, the Fed announced plans to end its quantitative tightening program on 1 December, citing evidence that banking system reserves are becoming scarce. The central bank will now reinvest Treasury and mortgage-backed security runoffs to keep its balance sheet size steady and reduce its weighted average maturity by shifting toward short-term Treasury bills.</p><p data-start=\"1388\" data-end=\"1766\">PIMCO said the September inflation data supported the latest cut, with underlying core CPI around 2.7% after adjusting for tariff effects, close to the Fed’s comfort zone. However, the firm added that Powell’s cautious tone reflects growing uncertainty over the next move, especially given limited visibility on labor conditions and potential tariff or fiscal shocks.</p><p data-start=\"1768\" data-end=\"2184\">Looking ahead, PIMCO expects one more cut in December, though with less conviction than before. Beyond that, the firm said easing will likely slow in 2026, with policymakers potentially pausing again if growth stabilises and inflation continues to drift lower. Tariff impacts and upcoming fiscal stimulus may complicate the Fed’s view of the neutral rate, reinforcing a meeting-by-meeting approach.</p><p data-start=\"2186\" data-end=\"2368\">“The Fed has bought itself time and optionality,” PIMCO wrote. “Powell’s message that a December cut isn’t guaranteed shows a central bank keen to stay flexible until data return.” </p><p data-start=\"2186\" data-end=\"2368\">---</p><p data-start=\"2186\" data-end=\"2368\">PIMCO (Pacific Investment Management Company) is one of the world’s largest and most influential investment managers. Best known for its expertise in fixed income, the firm manages more than US$2 trillion in assets across bonds, equities, real assets, and alternative strategies. A subsidiary of Germany’s Allianz SE since 2000, PIMCO serves institutional and retail investors globally, with its macroeconomic research and active management approach giving it outsized influence on market sentiment and policy discussions worldwide.</p>",

            "title": "The Importance Of Crypto Literacy In 2025",
            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptocurrency has moved from the domain of coders to determining the future of retirement funds, corporate payments, and finance in general. Yet most people don’t know what a blockchain is or why scammers want your seed phrase. Fast forward to 2025, and the distinction between wallets and exchanges, an understanding of “tokenomics,” and regulatory awareness allow the average user to look out for their own interests and identify opportunities in a market driven by hype.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Role of Crypto Literacy Today</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto rails can open new opportunities for payments, remittances, and savings, particularly where traditional banking is costly or not offered at all. You no longer need a bank to send money home, save for the future, or start a business. You just need a smartphone. For millions of people, that’s a shift in thegame.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is still a hotbed for scams, be it phishing texts, false “support” accounts, or an all-of-the-sudden “rug pull” where a token disappears post social media pump. Private key compromises accounted for the largest share (43.8%) of stolen crypto. Literacy means recognizing the red flags before you lose your money.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Gone are the days when you could simply follow the latest trending coin. Today, it’s critical for everyone, rather than just day traders, to understand how trading fees function, what assets are being locked, and how to use a blockchain explorer. For example, when new tokens launch on major exchanges, some traders jump in without checking fundamentals, leading to potential losses. That’s why it’s important to consult reliable sources, such as these <a href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/new-binance-listings/\">best Binance new listings</a>, which provide verified information on newly listed tokens and their details.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Major changes are underway in crypto regulation. The GENIUS Act now requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets, while the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is reshaping how the SEC and CFTC oversee digital assets. These developments highlight why crypto users must stay informed.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Policy and Corporate Adoption: More Choice, More Risk</h2><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Retirement Policy:</strong><br>The White House signed an order on August 7, 2025, allowing 401K access to crypto and nontraditional assets. Proponents say it’s a boon for diversification, while detractors worry about increased fees, legal hassles, and dangerous volatility. Where both sides are correct: Americans need legitimate crypto education before changing their retirement plan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Market Moves:</strong><br>This month, policy tailwinds and regulatory headwinds have sent bitcoin prices soaring to new all-time highs, but there are reasons why the bull market shouldn’t result in a bulls-only mentality. Savers who do not understand the risks of volatility, liquidity traps, and custody quirks will chase returns and end in regret.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Corporate Adoption:</strong><br>Tesla is noted for its back-and-forth crypto policies. The company briefly accepted bitcoin as payment for cars before reversing this decision 49 days later. However, you can still <a href=\"https://cryptoprocessing.com/learn/who-accepts-dogecoin\">purchase Tesla merch using Dogecoin</a>. Companies change policies rapidly, and verifying and double-checking has become a necessary skill.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges That Raise the Stakes</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most fundamental problems regarding crypto is a lack of knowledge. Many users do not fully understand private keys, seed phrases, or even wallet security at a high level, and keep their funds on exchanges, ceding control and risking losing them if the company collapses. The regulatory environment is also fragmented as law depends on the state or country. The hype by these “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-025-00947-1\">crypto influencers</a>” is questionable and can mislead newcomers. Fact-checking and source-checking are critical. Those looking to venture into crypto need to have an understanding of volatility, fees, and custody prior to converting long-term savings into crypto or any other volatile assets.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Building Your Crypto Knowledge: The Essentials</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">1.      Wallets &amp; Keys: Know the difference between “hot” online wallets and “cold” hardware storage. Never share your seed phrase; not even with customer support.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">2.      Exchanges: Learn how centralized exchanges handle withdrawals, charge fees, and what liquidity “depth” means for your order size.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">3.      Tokenomics &amp; Events: Emissions, vesting schedules, governance votes, and major exchange listings can all change asset value overnight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">4.      Security: Recognize common scams - phishing messages, fake websites, and malicious contract approvals. Revoke permissions when in doubt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">5.      Regulatory Changes: Keep up with U.S. policy on retirement accounts, IRS rules, and make sure your broker provides plain-English disclosures.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">6.      Begin with government publications, policies (rather than headlines or social media), and look for coverage in non-partisan, neutral news sources for any market-moving news.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Way Forward: Access With Education</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">New crypto alternatives should have resources and guides that clearly explain them. Concepts such as wallets, custody, and market structure should be taught in personal finance education. Resources should provide concise overviews of risks, fees, and custody, with disclosures matching the protections offered to experienced investors in traditional investments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Crypto is more mainstream, but having access is not enough. Literacy is what prevents investors from unnecessary losses. Only invest what you understand, be curious, learn the basics, and inquire. This is the appropriate kind of digital financial safeguard these days, overall responsible participation.</p>",

Ueda also said Japan’s economy is recovering moderately but still showing some weakness, with easy monetary policy expected to support growth. He noted that economic expansion will likely remain modest due to trade-related slowdowns and weaker overseas demand but should improve as global economies stabilize.</p><p data-start=\"1336\" data-end=\"1917\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The meeting with Trump and XI were described by Trump as being a \"12 out of 10\".

This is a theme that's been unfolding in the background for years and comes to prominence from time to time.</p><p>At the moment, it's particularly strong because the older/richer cohorts have benefited from house price inflation and equities while the non-home owning class doesn't own stocks and is paying higher rents. The wage hikes from the pandemic are now also in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Here is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said:</p><p>“On the K-shaped economy thing, I would say the same thing, or similar thing. We are — if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of, you know, big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there, and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products. But at the top people are spending, at the higher income and wealth — so, much, much anecdotal data on that. So, we think there is something there.”</p><p>Here are some telling (and differing quotes) from various executives this week:</p><p><strong>Scott Boatwright – CEO, Chipotle (CMG)</strong></p><p>“Earlier this year, as consumer sentiment declined sharply, we saw a broad-based pullback in frequency across all income cohorts… the gap has widened, with low- to middle-income guests further reducing frequency...
