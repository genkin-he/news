            "description": "<div class=\"post-content entry-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>Meta has turned a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/24/meta-amd-deal-chipmaker-ai-bubble-facebook\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$60 billion</a> sale of AI chips into a long-term stake in Advanced Micro Devices, thus boosting its artificial intelligence and guaranteeing a smoother scaling path.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Deal at a Glance  </h2>\n<p>Reportedly, Meta has negotiated to deliver up to $60 billion of moveable AI processors at AMD (an enterprise) in a five-year perspective. Under the agreement, AMD GPUs will cover about 6 gigawatts; and Meta will become one of the key purchasers of sixth-generation EPYC CPUs. </p>\n<p>Meta, in its turn, will be entitled to the warrants of up to <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/28/is-meta-platforms-a-buy-after-amd-deal/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">160 million</a> stock shares of AMD, which, under all conditions, would be approximately equal to 10 % of the packet in the semiconductor company. This type of stake essentially offers some form of significant discount on hardware spending by Meta and creates a high degree of leverage in the chain of suppliers of AI chips.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Does This Matter for Meta?</h2>\n<p>Meta has singled out <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/GOOGL/pressreleases/490229/is-meta-platforms-a-buy-after-amd-deal/#:~:text=Trading%20at%20a%20forward%20P,a%20top%20stock%20to%20own.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$115 billion to $135 billion</a> in capital spending by 2026, most of which will be on building out its AI data-center presence. Combined with the previous agreement it had with Nvidia to supply millions of GPUs and new Grace CPUs, the AMD relationship helps remove reliance on a supplier and helps as a hedge against the cost volatility as well as supply-chain hiccups. </p>\n<p>Such positioning, posit analysts believe, is a proactive move against a future bottleneck that is, availability of CPUs in an age of agentic AI, where unfulfilled server-side processing bottlenecks might affect performance improvements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stock View and Valuation  </h2>\n<p>The most recent valuation composite figures have Meta with a share price of about $648.51 at the end of February 2026, a market capitalization of approximately $1.6 trillion, and forward price-earnings ratio of about 21. The available trailing gross margin at the company is close to 82 %, highlighting strong profitability despite the high capital expenditures on AI. </p>\n<p>The combination of aggressive capital investments, high margins, and a forward P/E that is lower than the average in the peer group indicates that investors are raising expectations to the share price whilst leaving room to the possibility of a future rise that would be due to AI leverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future Outlook  </h2>\n<p>Just in case, Meta manages to scale to a multi-vendor AI silicon stack, it would drive down to unit prices, reduce risks, and accelerate model deployment all whilst maintaining its core advertising business growth within a mid-20 % variance range, as seen in its recent quarterly results. </p>\n<p>In the next few years, this combination of a significant AI investment level, strategic equities with vendors, and sustainable profit margins may make Meta one of the most sustainable compounders in the AI infrastructure story. </p>\n<p>This means that the AMD deal seems less of a speculative bet than a considered, analytics-based expansion of the functional engine of Meta to future computing cycles.</p>\n</div>",

At the same time, Ethereum was stable with fluctuations of about 5% around a value of 1,965 and was trading at 1.38 with a daily Ethereum volume of about 22billion.
