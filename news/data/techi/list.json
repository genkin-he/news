The cryptocurrency has fallen as low as possible at 67,788 by early trading, a decline of <a href=\"https://www.kucoin.com/news/insight/BTC/69a1245974202b00072f2caf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">nearly 1%</a> of the high it had hit, thus wiping out a short-term intra-week rise as risk aversion wanes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"image 103\" class=\"wp-image-199900\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"534\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-103.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-103.jpeg 800w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-103-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-103-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-103-400x267.jpeg 400w\" title=\"Bitcoin Crashes Below $68K: 5-Month Slide Deepens Amid Market Turmoil 1\" width=\"800\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Monthly Bloodbath Deepens</h2>\n<p>February has been one of the months of high turnover in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin alone dropped by 14% month over month, a 50% reduction on October when it was nearing 108000. Geopolitical pressures, turbulent American economic signs and the likelihood of an increase in trade tariffs have been an aggregate cause of investor flight of speculative exposures. </p>\n<p>Ether dropped 1.2%, to $2,038, which was heading to a 17% loss over a month, which was compounded by recent sales of over 10,000 ETH by Vitalik Buterin, worth about $20 million US dollars. XRP fell 2.3%, a <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-falls-back-below-68k-as-rebound-stalls-set-for-5th-straight-monthly-loss-4530480\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">15%</a> monthly loss, BNB has not changed much since but was still 20% off its previous high, Solana fell 17% and meme-based tokens like Dogecoin fell by 5.4%. In February, with the help of Coin Market Cap data, aggregate crypto market capitalization shrunk by approximately <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/bitcoin-slumps-with-key-70000-level-sight-2026-02-05/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$800</a> billion dollars, as per the data provided.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"image 104\" class=\"wp-image-199901\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-104.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-104.jpeg 800w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-104-600x360.jpeg 600w\" title=\"Bitcoin Crashes Below $68K: 5-Month Slide Deepens Amid Market Turmoil 2\" width=\"800\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Business Giants Are Not Acting As Saviors</h2>\n<p>Big business organizations have failed to offset the recession. Previously MicroStrategy Strategy Corp. showed no plan to continue its strategy of acquiring Bitcoin during the last quarter buying 5,000 BTC instead of 20,000 BTC in the previous quarter. This has decreased in speed, leading to alarm on possible liquidation of holdings as the debt increases.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin price news: BTC hits $68,500; ETH, DOGE, SOL lead amid crypto short  squeeze\" class=\"wp-image-199904\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"672\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-1200x672.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-1200x672.png 1200w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-600x336.png 600w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-400x225.png 400w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127.png 1600w\" title=\"Bitcoin Crashes Below $68K: 5-Month Slide Deepens Amid Market Turmoil 3\" width=\"1200\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">MARA’s AI Pivot Shines</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin mining companies, particularly, MARA Holdings, saw an after-hours growth of <a href=\"https://www.tradinggpt.pro/market/news/77539\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">19%</a> even after registering a loss of 1.7 billion in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter and falling short of revenue expectations.

Bitcoin has resistance of 200 days moving average broken at <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20260202/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">70,500</a> and the relative strength index (RSI) shows that it is over sold at 28. In turn, a further 10 to 15% decline to about $58,000 is realistic in case the trade tariffs worsen and the Federal Reserve rate-cut paths hit a dead end. </p>\n<p>However, ETF inflows have hit a high of <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/mara:us\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$2.5 billion</a> year-to-year implying that investors are still interested. Vested activities in the past post-half cycle show that there could be a recovery of up to <a href=\"https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/market-commentary/cathie-woods-2026-outlook\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">300%</a> in a year highlighting resilience. By observing what the Federal Reserve is prepared to do in terms of policy formation in March, it is possible to know whether a new boost of market energy will be created. Stakeholders should expect an increase in volatility in the meantime.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"post-content entry-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>The equity of Nvidia has improved at a considerable pace, escalating by about half in the past year, a trend that has been linked to its superiority in the emerging artificial-intelligence industry.</p>\n<p>In fiscal year 2026, fourth quarter, the firm had a revenue growth of <a href=\"https://ca.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-nvidia-q4-2026-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-4479400\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">US$68.1 billion</a>, an increase of 73% year to year, and an adjusted earnings per share of US1.62 as compared to the projected US1.52. The question is then what is going to stimulate the next multibillion-dollar growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Record Momentum Builds</h2>\n<p>It is not the first time Nvidia has developed it. The company has already achieved 11 times 50% profits in two months, which can be compared to major increments in 2016 and 2024.</p>\n<p>During the twelve months that followed, the revenue growth continued, where it stood at 65.2% and an average of 91.6% over the three years, which is supported by its free-cash-flow margin of 49% and price-to-earnings ratio of 48, which is a premium value as the online market dominates.</p>\n<p>NVIDIA has an effect that is not limited to the manufacture of hardware; it is the backbone of the artificial-intelligence economy, as the analyst team at Treis keeps track of the transformation that the company is going through: it is no longer about manufacturing game processors but rather a data-center powerhouse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three Catalysts That Change the Game</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><strong>1. First,</strong> sovereign artificial-intelligence projects are expanding rapidly: Nvidia is expected to secure over $30 billion in contracts by fiscal year 2026 with countries including Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. These projects broaden Nvidia’s revenue streams beyond cloud hyperscales.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Second</strong>, through ARM-based system-on-chip solutions, Nvidia will enter the consumer-AI personal-computer market by mid-2026; longtime Nvidia affiliates like Dell and Lenovo have already pre-cooked laptops that could tap an emerging multibillion-dollar opportunity and possibly eliminate reliance on data-center deployments.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Third,</strong> considerable strategic investments such as a rumored US30 billion investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of AI21 Labs support the aim of Nvidia taking control of things running in the ecosystem.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks Lurk in the Shadows  </h2>\n<p>The pitfalls should be disregarded. Signs of deteriorating working-capital balances would be evidence of channel-stuffing; the weakness of sales in China caused by regulatory limitations; and continued patent disputes would be dangerous to core technologies. The history of the 6% drop during the dot-com crash and that of the financial crisis of 85% are warning signs of possible declines.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Nvidia multi‑year candlestick chart with EMAs, MACD, Stochastics, volume, and sentiment‑based upside annotation\" class=\"wp-image-199804\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"561\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png 1200w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116-600x281.png 600w\" title=\"The Upcoming Multi-billion Dollar of Nvidia Stock Events Could Propel Will Significantly Higher?  1\" width=\"1200\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bright Horizon Ahead </h2>\n<p>Analysts look forward to an additional 30 -50% rally in case the said catalysts occur. As forecasts report that possible spending on artificial-intelligence infrastructure around the world is projected to grow to more than US$200 billion by year-end, according to the recent Gartner data dated February 23, 2026, the Nvidia competitive moat has been shown to be strong.</p>\n<p>Advanced investors see market declines as an acquisition point and place themselves to take advantage of the perceived artificial-intelligence wave in 2026.</p>\n</div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"post-content entry-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>The recent AI passion at Wall Street is less effective than it was a few days back, and now Wall Street is acting with apprehension and acting downwards on the software equities, and the concern has also offered the seasoned investors a rare chance to own stakes in both prominent companies. </p>\n<p>ServiceNow and Okta share a decrease in the environment of fears that AI would reduce the background functional value chains; however, recent statistics show that both businesses are still competitive in the AI-oriented market. ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) shares ended up 4.86%. Intraday on February 26, 2026, after a 34%. year-to-year decline, and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/okta-nasdaq-okta-q3-cy2025-214031228.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA)</a> was at <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/OKTA/chart/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">71.22,</a> up 3.06%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Tech Stock\" class=\"wp-image-199870\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-119.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-119.png 610w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-119-600x295.png 600w\" title=\"2 Tech Stocks Sold Off by AI Fears That Could Go Parabolic in 2026 1\" width=\"610\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ServiceNow Powers Ahead</h2>\n<p>ServiceNow is an automated workflow in the enterprise, and critics argue that its orchestration components will be replaced by artificial intelligence. The company, however, continuously integrated AI technologies into its platform over the last few years, as affirmed by CEO Bill McDermott in his statements, stating that AI does not eliminate enterprise orchestration; on the contrary, it is conditional upon it. </p>\n<p>This claim is supported by empirical data: 2025 revenue is projected to grow 21% to $13.3bn, net incomes are set to optimize at $1.7bn up <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2.6%,</a> and first-quarter <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/newsroom/press-releases/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial-results/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2026.</a> Subscription revenue is set to grow 22%, to 3.7bn. The gross margins have also not fallen and instead stand at 77.53 0, and the average number of shares that the firm traded in a day of 27 million shares against a benchmark of 16 million shares per day indicates increased investor interest.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"ServiceNow Stock\" class=\"wp-image-199872\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-121.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-121.png 610w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-121-600x295.png 600w\" title=\"2 Tech Stocks Sold Off by AI Fears That Could Go Parabolic in 2026 2\" width=\"610\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Okta Locks In Growth</h2>\n<p>The identity management system of Okta is resistant to intrusion into cyberspace and stands strong even when challenged by the intrusion services offered by other companies, like the AI-driven cracking of codes offered by Anthropic, which offers intrusion detection but does not offer credential authentication. The firm has learnt to distinguish between legitimate AI agents and malicious threats, and this ability is necessary at a time when automation is spreading. The fiscal third-party <a href=\"https://quartr.com/companies/servicenow-inc_5954\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a> revenue increased <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">13.9%</a> to reach $742 million dollars, net income doubled, and the gross margins were 77.08.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Okta Locks\" class=\"wp-image-199874\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png 720w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123-600x380.png 600w\" title=\"2 Tech Stocks Sold Off by AI Fears That Could Go Parabolic in 2026 3\" width=\"720\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Valuations Scream Buy</h2>\n<p>Forward price-to-earnings ratios are at all-time lows, almost half of peak levels, even as growth rates stay in double digits. Analyst Robert Izquierdo sees these valuation compressions as offering compelling entry points, now that AI-related market panic is subsiding.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, investors should expect huge rebounds. ServiceNow’s AI-coded platform and Okta’s cybersecurity moat both suggest the companies will experience over <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8560401/servicenow-now-projects-q1-subscription-revenue-growth\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">22%</a> annual growth until 2027. These results are projected to outpace the S&amp;P 500’s 2026 forecast. Therefore, directing capital to these equities seems wise.</p>\n</div>",
