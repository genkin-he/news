Bitcoin alone dropped by 14% month over month, a 50% reduction on October when it was nearing 108000. Geopolitical pressures, turbulent American economic signs and the likelihood of an increase in trade tariffs have been an aggregate cause of investor flight of speculative exposures. </p>\n<p>Ether dropped 1.2%, to $2,038, which was heading to a 17% loss over a month, which was compounded by recent sales of over 10,000 ETH by Vitalik Buterin, worth about $20 million US dollars.

Previously MicroStrategy Strategy Corp. showed no plan to continue its strategy of acquiring Bitcoin during the last quarter buying 5,000 BTC instead of 20,000 BTC in the previous quarter. This has decreased in speed, leading to alarm on possible liquidation of holdings as the debt increases.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin price news: BTC hits $68,500; ETH, DOGE, SOL lead amid crypto short  squeeze\" class=\"wp-image-199904\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"672\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-1200x672.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-1200x672.png 1200w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-600x336.png 600w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127-400x225.png 400w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-127.png 1600w\" title=\"Bitcoin Crashes Below $68K: 5-Month Slide Deepens Amid Market Turmoil 3\" width=\"1200\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">MARA’s AI Pivot Shines</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin mining companies, particularly, MARA Holdings, saw an after-hours growth of <a href=\"https://www.tradinggpt.pro/market/news/77539\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">19%</a> even after registering a loss of 1.7 billion in the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter and falling short of revenue expectations.

By observing what the Federal Reserve is prepared to do in terms of policy formation in March, it is possible to know whether a new boost of market energy will be created. Stakeholders should expect an increase in volatility in the meantime.</p>\n</div>",

The operating income of Amazon, however, in the entire year of <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/amazon-stock-reaches-alltime-high-at-25554-usd-93CH-4327608\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a> was not more than eighty billion dollars, which makes the viability of returns questionable, considering the fact that the usefulness of GPUs is only a matter of six years before they become obsolete. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-announces-fourth-quarter-210100904.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">4<sup>TH</sup> quarter</a> revenues grew by <a href=\"https://www.industrialinfo.com/news/article/amazon-boosts-2026-capex-to-200-billion-amid-data-center-surge--353118\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">14%</a> to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-q4-cy2025-212600289.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$213.4 billion</a>, and its AWS revenue grew by 2.1% to $35.58 billion, but the news of the capex plan led to a one-day decline of the share price by 11%. This distribution of funds could lead critics to believe that it is coming at the expense of share buybacks or dividend disbursement, which might result in sustained depreciation in case of a decline in enthusiasm toward AI, as has happened with other similar ventures, like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Amazon Spark\" class=\"wp-image-199772\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-114.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-114.png 610w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-114-600x295.png 600w\" title=\"Amazon's $200B AI Bet: Is AMZN Stock a Millionaire Maker or a Money Pit?

The competitive edge of AWS, as compared to its competitors like Microsoft, puts Amazon in a favorable position to claim the AI market in the future, as it has its footprint in e-commerce and the ability of cloud quality. Although the price fluctuations in the short run can be expected, more advanced investors can see the current downwards pattern as a good investment opportunity that can yield great profits as AI finds broader use.

            "description": "<div class=\"post-content entry-content\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<p>The equity of Nvidia has improved at a considerable pace, escalating by about half in the past year, a trend that has been linked to its superiority in the emerging artificial-intelligence industry.</p>\n<p>In fiscal year 2026, fourth quarter, the firm had a revenue growth of <a href=\"https://ca.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-nvidia-q4-2026-beats-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-4479400\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">US$68.1 billion</a>, an increase of 73% year to year, and an adjusted earnings per share of US1.62 as compared to the projected US1.52. The question is then what is going to stimulate the next multibillion-dollar growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Record Momentum Builds</h2>\n<p>It is not the first time Nvidia has developed it. The company has already achieved 11 times 50% profits in two months, which can be compared to major increments in 2016 and 2024.</p>\n<p>During the twelve months that followed, the revenue growth continued, where it stood at 65.2% and an average of 91.6% over the three years, which is supported by its free-cash-flow margin of 49% and price-to-earnings ratio of 48, which is a premium value as the online market dominates.</p>\n<p>NVIDIA has an effect that is not limited to the manufacture of hardware; it is the backbone of the artificial-intelligence economy, as the analyst team at Treis keeps track of the transformation that the company is going through: it is no longer about manufacturing game processors but rather a data-center powerhouse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three Catalysts That Change the Game</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><strong>1. First,</strong> sovereign artificial-intelligence projects are expanding rapidly: Nvidia is expected to secure over $30 billion in contracts by fiscal year 2026 with countries including Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. These projects broaden Nvidia’s revenue streams beyond cloud hyperscales.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Second</strong>, through ARM-based system-on-chip solutions, Nvidia will enter the consumer-AI personal-computer market by mid-2026; longtime Nvidia affiliates like Dell and Lenovo have already pre-cooked laptops that could tap an emerging multibillion-dollar opportunity and possibly eliminate reliance on data-center deployments.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Third,</strong> considerable strategic investments such as a rumored US30 billion investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of AI21 Labs support the aim of Nvidia taking control of things running in the ecosystem.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks Lurk in the Shadows  </h2>\n<p>The pitfalls should be disregarded. Signs of deteriorating working-capital balances would be evidence of channel-stuffing; the weakness of sales in China caused by regulatory limitations; and continued patent disputes would be dangerous to core technologies. The history of the 6% drop during the dot-com crash and that of the financial crisis of 85% are warning signs of possible declines.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Nvidia multi‑year candlestick chart with EMAs, MACD, Stochastics, volume, and sentiment‑based upside annotation\" class=\"wp-image-199804\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"561\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png 1200w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116-600x281.png 600w\" title=\"The Upcoming Multi-billion Dollar of Nvidia Stock Events Could Propel Will Significantly Higher?  1\" width=\"1200\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bright Horizon Ahead </h2>\n<p>Analysts look forward to an additional 30 -50% rally in case the said catalysts occur. As forecasts report that possible spending on artificial-intelligence infrastructure around the world is projected to grow to more than US$200 billion by year-end, according to the recent Gartner data dated February 23, 2026, the Nvidia competitive moat has been shown to be strong.</p>\n<p>Advanced investors see market declines as an acquisition point and place themselves to take advantage of the perceived artificial-intelligence wave in 2026.</p>\n</div>",
