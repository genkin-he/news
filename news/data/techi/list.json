This caused the security to fall by the recent highs to a price of US $223.35 by 24 February 2026, and hence wiped away nearly US $31billion of market value overnight.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Trigger  </h2>\n<p>The most important stimulus to accelerate sell-off was the introduction of the Claude Code programming AI tool created by Anthropic. Shareholders were worried that the new product goes directly head-to-head with the core consulting units and hybrid-cloud delivery lines of the company, which are both dependent today on human-centered AI deployment.</p>\n<p>Respondent investor fears were further heightened by the recent quarterly earnings statement of IBM which showed a slowdown in growth in these segments and also by indicating lower revenues than expected by analysts.</p>\n<p>This has seen the share price decrease by 28.6% in a 27-day period with the price dropping by US $312.95 on 2 February, to the current intra-day low making the company vulnerable to its worst monthly performance since 1968.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Financial quality‑metrics table showing revenue growth, operating cash flow margin, and leverage checks\" class=\"wp-image-199593\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"293\" sizes=\"(max-width: 957px) 100vw, 957px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXcqFM3nAYkzlR3S0tPr3llpCesJQfLPdmmRKzejvRNGqH9FHn88eP3FTvy44-YBk0XF7rj5maI3b3vQpVLCkuZWy_mp4W7gdPgThWGmgx9G8Mgys01s13iYXAivnZWpVVU-B_ylYlHxdMYNisGFNg.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXcqFM3nAYkzlR3S0tPr3llpCesJQfLPdmmRKzejvRNGqH9FHn88eP3FTvy44-YBk0XF7rj5maI3b3vQpVLCkuZWy_mp4W7gdPgThWGmgx9G8Mgys01s13iYXAivnZWpVVU-B_ylYlHxdMYNisGFNg.png 957w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXcqFM3nAYkzlR3S0tPr3llpCesJQfLPdmmRKzejvRNGqH9FHn88eP3FTvy44-YBk0XF7rj5maI3b3vQpVLCkuZWy_mp4W7gdPgThWGmgx9G8Mgys01s13iYXAivnZWpVVU-B_ylYlHxdMYNisGFNg-600x184.png 600w\" title=\"IBM STOCK: BUY THE DIP? 1\" width=\"957\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Historical Pattern  </h2>\n<p>Past experience has indicated that IBM has been able to recover after experiencing precipitous declines.

Basic financial metrics still confirm the structural strength of IBM, such as the stable growth of revenue, constant profitability, the stability of the cash-generation, and balance sheet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expert Take  </h2>\n<p>According to a Trefis Team analyst, IBM meets the criteria of quality rebounds, but the risks of implementation are high in an era of acceleration of the development of AI.</p>\n<p>Given that organizations want to see faster payoff on AI investment, the WatsonX platform, provided by IBM, will have to value itself better than agile rivals like Anthropic.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Table comparing IBM’s 30‑day dip versus SPY and IBM’s subsequent 1‑year return, peak return, max drop, and days to peak\" class=\"wp-image-199594\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"202\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXczXE-Rq5oAovuoe4lFrpU_SnJ5sTHSPAPb-53R-CmDsQVIsrXcQ3Mvz6oWIHLvHZlaFngUeuUpVuESNtBC2T_FoHb4NoRhBOs0K-NtqniI72DjaAvWnkZFoquRFXqzIt6GiUJ16Tw0uUYXpaGAvyw.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXczXE-Rq5oAovuoe4lFrpU_SnJ5sTHSPAPb-53R-CmDsQVIsrXcQ3Mvz6oWIHLvHZlaFngUeuUpVuESNtBC2T_FoHb4NoRhBOs0K-NtqniI72DjaAvWnkZFoquRFXqzIt6GiUJ16Tw0uUYXpaGAvyw.png 955w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AD_4nXczXE-Rq5oAovuoe4lFrpU_SnJ5sTHSPAPb-53R-CmDsQVIsrXcQ3Mvz6oWIHLvHZlaFngUeuUpVuESNtBC2T_FoHb4NoRhBOs0K-NtqniI72DjaAvWnkZFoquRFXqzIt6GiUJ16Tw0uUYXpaGAvyw-600x127.png 600w\" title=\"IBM STOCK: BUY THE DIP? 2\" width=\"955\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buy the Dip?  </h2>\n<p>The short-term volatility in the market persists, as the rotation goes towards the quantum-technology startups and fixed-income securities.

However, the lack of revenue guidance adjustment indicates a possible disequilibrium which is further tightened by the off balance sheet lease obligations worth <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-248-billion-ai-bet-195143106.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$248 billion</a> that squeeze profit margins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outlook: High Stakes Bet</h2>\n<p>The expansion of AI at Oracle is an issue of dilution; but the anticipated cloud revenues of the company of over <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-orcl-growth-juggernaut-expanding-035651281.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$25 billion</a> by FY2026 can justify the investments.</p>\n<p>Finally, the future of the company will be to turn the recurring-payment commitment into liquid capital ahead of any credit downgrades; this will take effective practice instead of the gambling spirit in the 2026 AI market.</p>\n</div>",

Snap announced today that its subscriber base increased 71 % year on year in Q4 2025.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rocky Road, Bright Horizon  </h2>\n<p>The apparent dip in the DAU is found partly due to the decreased expenditure on marketing and the prohibitions in the Russian and Australian markets, which alters the beholders of advertisers with the aim of reaching the masses. </p>\n<p>Analysts theorize that the prospects of augmented reality, and subscription momentum of Snap can have long-term benefits, but state that the number of users need to be stable to be successful over time. </p>\n<p>In the case of 2026, analysts are optimistic of the potentially unstable phase, but synergy between smart advertisement solutions and subscriptions has Snap in a position of earning something should DAUs make a comeback. Future long-term investors should start the positions on a low scale.</p>\n</div>",
