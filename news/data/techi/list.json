The company, however, continuously integrated AI technologies into its platform over the last few years, as affirmed by CEO Bill McDermott in his statements, stating that AI does not eliminate enterprise orchestration; on the contrary, it is conditional upon it. </p>\n<p>This claim is supported by empirical data: 2025 revenue is projected to grow 21% to $13.3bn, net incomes are set to optimize at $1.7bn up <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2.6%,</a> and first-quarter <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/newsroom/press-releases/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial-results/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2026.</a> Subscription revenue is set to grow 22%, to 3.7bn.

The firm has learnt to distinguish between legitimate AI agents and malicious threats, and this ability is necessary at a time when automation is spreading. The fiscal third-party <a href=\"https://quartr.com/companies/servicenow-inc_5954\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a> revenue increased <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">13.9%</a> to reach $742 million dollars, net income doubled, and the gross margins were 77.08.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Okta Locks\" class=\"wp-image-199874\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png 720w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123-600x380.png 600w\" title=\"2 Tech Stocks Sold Off by AI Fears That Could Go Parabolic in 2026 3\" width=\"720\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Valuations Scream Buy</h2>\n<p>Forward price-to-earnings ratios are at all-time lows, almost half of peak levels, even as growth rates stay in double digits. Analyst Robert Izquierdo sees these valuation compressions as offering compelling entry points, now that AI-related market panic is subsiding.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, investors should expect huge rebounds. ServiceNow’s AI-coded platform and Okta’s cybersecurity moat both suggest the companies will experience over <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8560401/servicenow-now-projects-q1-subscription-revenue-growth\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">22%</a> annual growth until 2027.

Due to significant contracted demand from AI-related partnerships, remaining performance obligations (RPO) increased to $523 billion. </p>\n<p>Shares were volatile despite exceeding projections, and high capital expenditures and financing announcements continued to put pressure on them. However, the lack of revenue guidance adjustment indicates a possible disequilibrium which is further tightened by the off balance sheet lease obligations worth <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-248-billion-ai-bet-195143106.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$248 billion</a> that squeeze profit margins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outlook: High Stakes Bet</h2>\n<p>The expansion of AI at Oracle is an issue of dilution; but the anticipated cloud revenues of the company of over <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-orcl-growth-juggernaut-expanding-035651281.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$25 billion</a> by FY2026 can justify the investments.</p>\n<p>Finally, the future of the company will be to turn the recurring-payment commitment into liquid capital ahead of any credit downgrades; this will take effective practice instead of the gambling spirit in the 2026 AI market.</p>\n</div>",

The question is then what is going to stimulate the next multibillion-dollar growth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Record Momentum Builds</h2>\n<p>It is not the first time Nvidia has developed it. The company has already achieved 11 times 50% profits in two months, which can be compared to major increments in 2016 and 2024.</p>\n<p>During the twelve months that followed, the revenue growth continued, where it stood at 65.2% and an average of 91.6% over the three years, which is supported by its free-cash-flow margin of 49% and price-to-earnings ratio of 48, which is a premium value as the online market dominates.</p>\n<p>NVIDIA has an effect that is not limited to the manufacture of hardware; it is the backbone of the artificial-intelligence economy, as the analyst team at Treis keeps track of the transformation that the company is going through: it is no longer about manufacturing game processors but rather a data-center powerhouse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three Catalysts That Change the Game</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><strong>1. First,</strong> sovereign artificial-intelligence projects are expanding rapidly: Nvidia is expected to secure over $30 billion in contracts by fiscal year 2026 with countries including Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. These projects broaden Nvidia’s revenue streams beyond cloud hyperscales.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Second</strong>, through ARM-based system-on-chip solutions, Nvidia will enter the consumer-AI personal-computer market by mid-2026; longtime Nvidia affiliates like Dell and Lenovo have already pre-cooked laptops that could tap an emerging multibillion-dollar opportunity and possibly eliminate reliance on data-center deployments.</td></tr><tr><td><br/><strong>Third,</strong> considerable strategic investments such as a rumored US30 billion investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of AI21 Labs support the aim of Nvidia taking control of things running in the ecosystem.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Risks Lurk in the Shadows  </h2>\n<p>The pitfalls should be disregarded. Signs of deteriorating working-capital balances would be evidence of channel-stuffing; the weakness of sales in China caused by regulatory limitations; and continued patent disputes would be dangerous to core technologies. The history of the 6% drop during the dot-com crash and that of the financial crisis of 85% are warning signs of possible declines.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Nvidia multi‑year candlestick chart with EMAs, MACD, Stochastics, volume, and sentiment‑based upside annotation\" class=\"wp-image-199804\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"561\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116.png 1200w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-116-600x281.png 600w\" title=\"The Upcoming Multi-billion Dollar of Nvidia Stock Events Could Propel Will Significantly Higher?  1\" width=\"1200\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bright Horizon Ahead </h2>\n<p>Analysts look forward to an additional 30 -50% rally in case the said catalysts occur.

The business will probably perform better than anticipated.</p>\n<p>Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO, President &amp; Chairman, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/17/micron-mu-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“an outstanding start to fiscal 2026, delivering fiscal Q1 revenue, gross margin and EPS well above the high end of our guidance.” Mehrotra stated that Micron has “completed agreements on price and volume for our entire calendar 2026 HBM supply including Micron’s industry-leading HBM4,” and forecasted an HBM total addressable market (TAM) CAGR of approximately 40% through calendar 2028 from $35 billion in 2025 to around $100 billion in 2028.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prognosis: High Stakes, High Reward.  </h2>\n<p>The demand on the Micron solutions based on memory is still dependent on the projected spending on AI hyperscalers in 2026, but the success of the company depends on the long-term investment in infrastructure. </p>\n<p>In case these macro-economic forces remain in place, Micron may outpace the S&amp;P 500 mark within a period of five years but, on the contrary, a downturn in demand could be a big drawback. </p>\n<p>Micron is an interesting investment target to risk-taking investors who are willing to take the long-term prospect of AI applications.</p>\n</div>",
