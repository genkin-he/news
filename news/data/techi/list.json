The company, however, continuously integrated AI technologies into its platform over the last few years, as affirmed by CEO Bill McDermott in his statements, stating that AI does not eliminate enterprise orchestration; on the contrary, it is conditional upon it. </p>\n<p>This claim is supported by empirical data: 2025 revenue is projected to grow 21% to $13.3bn, net incomes are set to optimize at $1.7bn up <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2.6%,</a> and first-quarter <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/newsroom/press-releases/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2026-financial-results/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2026.</a> Subscription revenue is set to grow 22%, to 3.7bn.

The firm has learnt to distinguish between legitimate AI agents and malicious threats, and this ability is necessary at a time when automation is spreading. The fiscal third-party <a href=\"https://quartr.com/companies/servicenow-inc_5954\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a> revenue increased <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/okta-2-6-rise-bounce-reset-priced-fears-2602/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">13.9%</a> to reach $742 million dollars, net income doubled, and the gross margins were 77.08.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Okta Locks\" class=\"wp-image-199874\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123.png 720w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-123-600x380.png 600w\" title=\"2 Tech Stocks Sold Off by AI Fears That Could Go Parabolic in 2026 3\" width=\"720\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Valuations Scream Buy</h2>\n<p>Forward price-to-earnings ratios are at all-time lows, almost half of peak levels, even as growth rates stay in double digits. Analyst Robert Izquierdo sees these valuation compressions as offering compelling entry points, now that AI-related market panic is subsiding.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, investors should expect huge rebounds. ServiceNow’s AI-coded platform and Okta’s cybersecurity moat both suggest the companies will experience over <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8560401/servicenow-now-projects-q1-subscription-revenue-growth\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">22%</a> annual growth until 2027.
