Due to significant contracted demand from AI-related partnerships, remaining performance obligations (RPO) increased to $523 billion. </p>\n<p>Shares were volatile despite exceeding projections, and high capital expenditures and financing announcements continued to put pressure on them. However, the lack of revenue guidance adjustment indicates a possible disequilibrium which is further tightened by the off balance sheet lease obligations worth <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracles-248-billion-ai-bet-195143106.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$248 billion</a> that squeeze profit margins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outlook: High Stakes Bet</h2>\n<p>The expansion of AI at Oracle is an issue of dilution; but the anticipated cloud revenues of the company of over <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-orcl-growth-juggernaut-expanding-035651281.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$25 billion</a> by FY2026 can justify the investments.</p>\n<p>Finally, the future of the company will be to turn the recurring-payment commitment into liquid capital ahead of any credit downgrades; this will take effective practice instead of the gambling spirit in the 2026 AI market.</p>\n</div>",

The AI semiconductor conglomerate beat expectations with adjusted earnings per share of 172 instead of 153 predicted, and gave guidance of 785 billion in the first quarter, but futures dropped 0.2% on inventory concerns. </p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency markets tend to reflect the U.S. technology markets, and the sentiment did not drop, although the Fear-and-Greed Index was at an extreme-fear range of 11/100.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Altcoin Participation</h2>\n<p>The increase in momentum was absorbed by secondary cryptocurrencies; Ether climbed 9% to $2 056, XRP rose 5% to $1 43, and Solana grew <a href=\"https://businessabc.net/nvidia-reports-record-financial-results-for-q4-and-fiscal-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">27%</a> to $87.  BNB, Dogecoin, and Cardano achieved returns between <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-drops-lowest-price-since-204114003.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">7</a> and 15.  One such meme token, $TRUMP, was gaining by 3.5%, but most were very much negative in the past few months.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Hits Lowest Since 2024 US Election\" class=\"wp-image-199791\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"559\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" src=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-95.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-95.jpeg 960w, https://www.techi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-95-600x349.jpeg 600w\" title=\"Bitcoin Hits $68K as Short-Squeeze Triggers 6% Surge | Market News 3\" width=\"960\"/></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future Prospect Breakout Consolidation</h2>\n<p>Analysts predict a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-vs-ethereum-vs-solana-163359080.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">59%</a> probability that Bitcoin could reach $98,000 if it breaks its current wedge pattern. This probability is based on previous gains in February. Philip Gradwell, a leading Chain lysis researcher, notes that a short squeeze may indicate capitulation. If bargain buying occurs and the macroeconomic situation normalizes, Bitcoin could rise to $100,000. However, persistent negative sentiment, high volatility <a href=\"https://intellectia.ai/news/stock/nvidias-q4-fy2026-eps-expected-to-rise-71\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">71%</a> per month in ETF, and China-related risks connected to Nvidia could temper this optimism. Monitoring ETF inflows and U.S. policy helps in projecting the future trend. Recovery is possible, but it may remain below bear market levels, under $64,000.</p>\n</div>",
