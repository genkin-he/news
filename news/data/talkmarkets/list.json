This compares to earnings of $1.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +6.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of +10.56%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.</p><p>Apple, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $102.47 billion for the quarter ended September 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.25%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $94.93 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Apple shares have added about 7.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.2%.</p><h2><br/>What's Next for Apple?</h2><p>While Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this <a href=\"https://www.zacks.com/stock/research/AAPL/earnings-calendar\">earnings release</a>, the estimate revisions trend for Apple was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.44 on $130.27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.87 on $436.7 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the top 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/does-unitedhealth-stock-have-more-upside-after-q3-earnings?post=531641\">Does UnitedHealth Stock Have More Upside After Q3 Earnings?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/2-intriguing-stocks-to-watch-after-exceeding-quarterly-expectations-agys-w?post=531301\">2 Intriguing Stocks To Watch After Exceeding Quarterly Expectations: AGYS, W</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/buy-the-mag-7-laggards-as-earnings-approach-amzn-aapl?post=531182\">Buy The Mag 7 Laggards As Earnings Approach?: AMZN, AAPL</a><br/></div>",

Not groceries. Not utilities. The discretionary spending that evaporates instantly.</p><p>DoorDash <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/dash\">DASH</a>, Affirm <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/afrm\">AFRM</a>, and Draft Kings <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/dkng\">DKNG</a> are all flashing the same warning signals Blake watches for economic weakness. These aren't random picks. These are companies with fundamental cracks that widen the moment consumer spending slows.</p><p>Here's what makes these setups compelling:</p><ul><li><strong>DoorDash:</strong> Negative 40 fixed charge coverage ratio. That means they're losing money and carrying 40 times their earnings in debt. Revenue and net income both sliding. When consumers tighten belts, paying $10-15 delivery fees for McDonald's disappears first.</li><li><strong>Affirm:</strong> The buy-now-pay-later model works until defaults hit. They're already losing money on lending before any serious economic stress. Fixed charge coverage at negative 12. Their three-year and five-year averages on net income? All negative.</li><li><strong>Draft Kings:</strong> Just hit 52-week lows on closing prices. Negative fixed charge coverage. Downtrending revenues. Blake's targeting a 20% drop from current levels. Sports betting is pure discretionary spending that vanishes when budgets tighten.</li></ul><p>Blake's not just shorting weakness. He's structuring diagonal spreads that turn positive on time decay from day one. The setup lets you collect premium monthly while positioning for significant downside moves.</p><p>The beauty of his approach is the reward-risk ratios. On DraftKings alone, Blake's diagonal could deliver an 8-to-1 reward-risk by March if the stock simply stays flat. If it drops to his targets, the returns multiply.</p><p>These are the sectors that break first when economic pressure builds. Blake's getting positioned now before the obvious signals appear in headline data.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>Video Length: 00:13:29</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mm9iP8ALNNw?si=GaaV-Ct_9IS5IRCw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-fed-cut-rates-bonds-collapsed-instead?post=531537\">The Fed Cut Rates.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Man, Computer, Stock Trading, Iphone, Hands, Finance\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/11/27/16/59/man-5782411_960_720.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/photos/man-computer-stock-trading-iphone-5782411/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></em></p><p><br/>We have been noting that the <a href=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/traders-insight/securities/macro/death-taxes-dip-buying/\">“half-life” of dips</a> has been steadily shrinking. It was once normal for major indices to take occasional days-long breathers even during the most powerful bull runs. Recent events indicate that the relentless urge to buy every dip, no matter how fleeting, has shrunk the length of those respites to mere minutes. The activity of the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/SPX\">SPX</a>) in yesterday afternoon’s and this morning’s sessions offer excellent evidence to bolster that assertion.</p><p>The first example occurred after Chair Powell dropped the following bombshell during the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20251029.pdf\">start of his press conference</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a forgone [sic] conclusion—far from it.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>Clearly this was not welcome news for those traders who had been expecting a third cut before the end of the year. <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">CME futures</a> were pricing in at least a 92% chance of a December cut to follow the near 100% probability of yesterday’s cut. Those slipped to below 70% after Powell’s comment. The pricing on <a href=\"https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader/#/market-details?id=658663572%7C20251210%7C3.625%7CDecember%2010,%202025&amp;detail=contract_details\">IBKR ForecastTrader</a> was not quite as extreme, pricing in no less than a 15% chance of a December rate target above 3.625%, but the views now roughly match those shown by the CME.</p><h3><br/><strong>Will the US Fed Funds Target Rate be set above 3.625% at the FOMC meeting ending December 10, 2025?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/image-81-1100x542.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: IBKR ForecastTrader</em></p><p><br/>The reaction in stocks and bonds was swift and sudden. Rates across the Treasury yield curve rose by about 10 basis points and SPX fell by nearly 1% almost immediately. The difference is that bond prices held their losses while stocks quickly recovered from theirs after churning at the lows for just a few minutes. By the end of the day, SPX was almost exactly unchanged.</p><h3><br/><strong>SPX 2-Days, 2-Minute Candles</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/image-82-1100x681.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Source: Interactive Brokers</em></p><p><br/>This was a near exact repeat of the activity at during the September FOMC press conference.We noted that day’s 1% drop and bounce back to near-unchanged levels. The plunge occurred later in that press conference, but the rebound was even more swift.</p><p>To be fair, it is not unreasonable to expect air pockets during events like discussions from the Fed Chair. Any comments from a key central banker have the potential to move markets, and thus traders know to be a bit wary while they are occurring. Market makers become more defensive, widening bid/ask spreads and reducing the size of their quotes. That in turn means that a wave of buying or selling has the potential to move markets more than they otherwise might. Hence the big drops and rebounds that occur.</p><p>But we also saw something similar just after this morning’s open even as no fresh news was breaking.Investors had no shortage of meaningful data to digest since yesterday’s close.Alphabet’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOG\">GOOG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GOOGL\">GOOGL</a>) well-received earnings, Microsoft’s (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>) modest disappointment, and the shock of Meta Platforms’ (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>) outsize tax bill were being discussed since yesterday afternoon, and overnight we learned that President Trump and Premier Xi reached a deal framework that more or less returned us to the status quo that prevailed before the last escalation of trade and tariff threats.On balance, it was understandable why we might have seen some early profit-taking.But once again, the buyers stepped in quickly and we traded at only modestly lower levels throughout the morning.</p><p>This takes us to an extreme question: might we reach a point where the desire to buy every dip erases dips altogether? That sounds ridiculous, but if the half-life of dips continues to shrink, might it reach such a short time interval that any dips are too short to capture? Or alternatively, if dip buying is so foolproof, might some traders and investors take the mindset that why bother selling if you’re going to be proven wrong almost immediately? That sounds downright scary. If everyone is fully invested, who would be left to buy if some investors indeed decided to change course? We’re not at that point – at least not yet – and perish the thought that we actually get there!</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/relative-complacency-rules?post=531152\">Relative Complacency Rules</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/big-week-and-full-steam-ahead?post=530797\">Big Week (And Full Steam) Ahead</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/all-clear-from-cpi?post=530353\">All Clear From CPI</a><br/></div>",

With sentiment turning darker in the market throughout the day, these two companies may be critical to restore the upward momentum or else it could get ugly.</p><p>With that in mind, Amazon appears to be doing what it can to buck the downbeat mood by reporting results which the market clearly is impressed with. Here is what the world's largest retailer just reported:</p><ul><li>EPS $1.95 vs. $1.68 q/q, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $1.58</li><li>Net sales $180.17 billion, +13% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $177.82 billion \t<ul><li>Online stores net sales $67.41 billion, +9.8% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $66.93 billion</li><li>Physical Stores net sales $5.58 billion, +6.7% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $5.56 billion</li><li>Third-Party Seller Services net sales $42.49 billion, +12% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $42.05 billion</li><li>Subscription Services net sales $12.57 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $12.49 billion</li></ul></li><li>Third-party seller services net sales excluding F/X +11% vs. +10% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate +10.8%</li><li>Subscription services net sales excluding F/X +10% vs. +11% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +10.7%</li></ul><p>Geographically the results were strong all around: </p><ul><li>North America net sales $106.27 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>beating</strong></em> estimate $104.96 billion</li><li>International net sales $40.90 billion, +14% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $40.77 billion</li></ul><p>So far so good, with every line time beating. But what the market was especially focused on was the high margin AWS data, and here numbers also beat solidly: </p><ul><li>AWS net sales $33.01 billion, +20% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate $32.39 billion</li><li>Amazon Web Services net sales excluding F/X +20% vs. +19% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimate +17.9%</li></ul><p>Turning to operating profits, here the results were rather mixed: </p><ul><li>Operating income $17.42 billion vs. $17.41 billion y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate $19.72 billion\t<ul><li>Operating margin 9.7% vs. 11% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate 11.1%</li><li>North America operating margin +4.5% vs. +5.9% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +6.98%</li><li>International operating margin 2.9% vs. 3.6% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate 4.02%</li></ul></li></ul><p>As for fulfillment expenses, these came in slightly above estimates, as did the seller unit mix. These may deteriorate iftariffs rise: </p><ul><li>Fulfillment expense $27.68 billion, +12% y/y, estimate $27.49 billion</li><li>Seller unit mix 62% vs. 60% y/y, estimate 60.7%</li></ul><p>Of the above, the most notable highlight was AWS which grew revenue by 19.7% (stronger than the 19% year ago) to $33.0BN, above the sellside estimate of $32.39BN. That said, despite the latest quarterly beat, the growth rate is clearly slowing but not enough for the market to care right now:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/bfm360D.jpg?itok=6z2wrpMO\" width=\"600\"/></p><p><br/>While AWS sales growth was solid, just as impressive was the the <strong>margin for the segment also increased from 32.9% in Q2 to 34.6%, beating the median Wall Street estimate of 33.95%, </strong>if below the recent average from the past two years.

Its first fiscal quarter earnings report began with a deluge of news that shareholders had to digest. The most important one was that the company was forfeiting a small chunk of its original 32.5% stake in OpenAI. It settled on 27%. In exchange, OpenAI has agreed to buy an incremental $250 billion of Azure services.</p><p>I see this as a positive. Microsoft’s entire stake in OpenAI is worth $130 billion. Plus, the company is boosting its AI capacity by 80% this year, promising to double its total data center footprint in the next two years.</p><h2><br/><strong>Why I’d buy MSFT stock hand over fist today</strong></h2><p>Microsoft now plans to spend even more on AI infrastructure. Capacity will still remain short of demand, and this build-out could potentially lead to Azure overtaking AWS. The cloud business grew 40%.</p><p>When you combine that with the OpenAI stake, its own in-house AI development, and the extremely profitable Office software stack, MSFT stock becomes very attractive. It even has an active quantum computing program. Its Majorana 1 quantum chip “...can be easily deployed inside Azure datacenters.” It’s too early, and likely too expensive to do that just yet. But that’s another feather that a competitor like Meta lacks in its hat. Furthermore, cash from software remains far more reliable than cash from ads.</p><p>MSFT stock is currently trading just below its 20-day moving average, near $520. I’d expect the stock to snap back to new highs as the market digests these earnings. The breakneck growth of Azure can take it above $600 by mid-2026.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://moneymorning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/10/MSFT-3.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/broadcom-both-benefits-and-suffers-from-the-ai-surge?post=531984\">Broadcom Both Benefits And Suffers From The AI Surge</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-investors-are-turning-bearish-on-meta?post=531943\">Why Investors Are Turning Bearish On META</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/what-can-investors-expect-from-archer-aviation-earnings-next-week?post=531528\">What Can Investors Expect From Archer Aviation Earnings Next Week? </a></p></div>",

And Beijing promised to buy “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, said Trump.</p><p>While the detente provides relief to both sides, it does little to address the fundamental divergence between two superpowers whose economies are decoupling in many sectors and who are racing for supremacy in areas such as artificial intelligence.  </p><p>In comments to reporters on his way back to the U.S. from South Korea, Trump was effusive about the meeting.</p><p>“Overall, I guess on the scale of from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,” he said.</p><p>The actual numbers the two agreed on were more modest. </p><p>The U.S. also agreed to put on hold for one year a September move to apply export restrictions to certain subsidiaries of already blacklisted entities, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said. And both sides placed a one-year pause on reciprocal port fees on each other’s vessels, which comes on the heels of South Korea agreeing to invest $150 billion in American shipbuilding.</p><p>Speaking on Air Force One, Trump said he thinks the U.S. and China will be able to sign a trade deal “pretty soon,” and that they didn’t have too many stumbling blocks left.</p><p>Some trade analysts were skeptical. Describing Thursday’s agreements as marginal, William Bratton, an analyst at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote that they don’t “represent a ‘grand bargain’ or a large-scale reset of the relationship.”</p><p>Xi appeared to come out of the meeting with a strong hand, analysts said, particularly on rare earths.  </p><p>China began implementing strict export controls on rare earths in April. In October, Beijing angered the Trump administration by further enhancing restrictions on the export of the minerals, including increasing the number of controlled rare-earth elements.</p><p>While the newer rare-earth export rules are likely to be delayed, many industry watchers noted that China appears set to maintain the export-control procedures it introduced in the spring.</p><p>That would preserve Beijing’s ability to punish the U.S. economy by denying export licenses to a swath of American companies that rely on rare earths. </p><p>On fentanyl, much will depend on the actions China takes next. The U.S. has pressed China for years to do more to control the export of chemicals used to make the drug, a synthetic opioid blamed for hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the U.S.</p><p>More-stringent regulation of the chemicals likely won’t be enough to solve the crisis because Chinese producers are adept at slightly altering the chemistry of precursors to get around the rules.</p><p>Trump and Xi last met in person in 2019, when they held an 80-minute lunch on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, and agreed to a cease-fire in trade hostilities. </p><p>A “Phase One” trade deal signed in early 2020 addressed neither of those points, instead obligating China to buy more soybeans from American farmers—something Beijing largely failed to fulfill. A Phase Two never materialized.</p></blockquote><p><br/><strong>Precisely as Expected</strong></p><p>On October 28, I made what I consider to be the easiest call of the month: <strong><a href=\"https://mishtalk.com/economics/trumps-big-china-deal-looks-more-like-an-uneasy-truce/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump’s Big China Deal Looks More Like an Uneasy Truce</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Both sides will announce a win. But no key issues will be resolved.</p><p><strong>Now What?</strong></p><p>Hooray, China will buy more soybeans, loosen export restrictions on rare earths, and pledge to do more about fentanyl.</p><p>In return, Trump will not do 100 Percent tariffs and will roll back some of the so-called fentanyl tariffs.</p><p>Since April, there have been about seven major tit-for-tat Trump escalations with China, soon followed by Trump Tacos when China retaliated.</p><p>If the above outline holds, congratulations! Things will be back to where they roughly were in March.</p><p>Q: Since both Trump and Xi are liars, what do we really have?<br/>A: The answer is an uneasy truce.</p><p>There may be other agreements but will Xi honor them? Trump?</p><p>No key items will be addressed but China will buy more soybeans, at least for a while, so Trump will brag. He will fail to recall that it was his actions that caused China to stop buying soybeans.</p><p>This is a win-win from where we were a week ago, but a big pile of nothing compared to where we were earlier this year.</p></blockquote><p><br/>This is indeed a win-win.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"macro photography of black circuit board\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518770660439-4636190af475?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/FO7JIlwjOtU\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></em></p><p><br/>Quantum computing represents one of the most significant long-term threats to modern cryptography. While classical computers operate on \"bits\" (a 1 or a 0), quantum computers use \"qubits,\" which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This allows them to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than any classical machine. This paradigm shift holds immense promise for science but also poses an existential risk to the security infrastructure underpinning global finance, communication, and the entire blockchain ecosystem. The race is on to develop quantum-resistant technologies before a sufficiently powerful \"cryptographically relevant quantum computer\" (CRQC), capable of breaking today's encryption, becomes a reality.</p><p>The timeline for such a machine remains a subject of intense debate, but most experts place its arrival anywhere from five to fifteen years away. These computers do not use traditional silicon chips; instead, their processors are built from highly specialized qubits. The leading designs include superconducting qubits, favored by Google and IBM, and trapped-ion qubits. Both of these designs are incredibly delicate and must operate in heavily shielded, near-absolute-zero environments to maintain their quantum state. The primary threat to cryptocurrency comes from <strong>Shor's algorithm</strong>, a quantum algorithm that can efficiently find the prime factors of large numbers. Current blockchain encryption, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, relies on the fact that this factoring problem is practically impossible for classical computers to solve. A CRQC running Shor's algorithm could take a public key (which becomes visible on the network after a transaction) and use it to derive the user's private key in minutes, giving the attacker full control of the wallet.</p><p>If a quantum computer were to \"solve\" a blockchain, the scenario would be catastrophic. An attacker could monitor the network and, the moment a public key is revealed, calculate the corresponding private key and sign a new transaction to drain the wallet before the user's legitimate transaction even confirms. This vulnerability would shatter the public's trust, causing a total and likely irreversible collapse of the market. The majority of cryptocurrencies currently lie on the <strong>vulnerable</strong> end of the spectrum, as their core cryptographic signatures are not quantum-resistant. This threat is not just theoretical; major nation-states and the world's largest tech corporations are the primary leaders in the race to build a CRQC, whether for scientific discovery or national security.</p><p>In the face of this future threat and today's pressing privacy-shortfalls, new cryptographic methods are emerging as the future of on-chain security. <strong>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs</strong> are at the forefront of this shift. As noted by industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, ZK-proofs are a fundamental breakthrough in computer science that allows for verification without revelation. This technology enables a party to prove that a statement is true (e.g., \"I have sufficient funds for this transaction\") without revealing any of the underlying data (e.g., \"my total balance is X\"). This provides a powerful solution for on-chain privacy. While Armstrong and others primarily champion ZK-proofs today for their scaling benefits (in the form of ZK-rollups), their ability to ensure privacy is their other killer feature, paving the way for a more secure, private, and scalable blockchain future.</p><p>This privacy model also offers a powerful defense against quantum attacks. The primary quantum vulnerability for blockchains like Bitcoin is that a user's <strong>public key is exposed</strong> on-chain when they make a transaction, giving Shor's algorithm the target it needs to derive the private key. ZK-proofs can be used to create <strong>\"shielded wallets\"</strong> or \"shielded transactions,\" a system where transactions are validated on the network without ever revealing the sender's address, the receiver's address, or the amount. By hiding this key identifying information, the public key is never broadcast, effectively starving a quantum attacker of the one piece of data it needs to initiate the attack. This is a move toward a \"never trust, never reveal\" architecture. This strategy appears to be central to Brian Armstrong's vision; recent reports confirm Coinbase acquired the ZK-privacy team from Iron Fish to build private transactions directly into its Layer-2 network, Base. This move strongly suggests a strategic direction that leverages ZK-privacy not only for user confidentiality but as a foundational layer for a more resilient and quantum-resistant blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>A second, more immediate threat is mass surveillance by AI, which is why \"auditable privacy\" has become a crucial missing piece for crypto's adoption. This is a system that keeps transactions private from the public by default, but gives users the choice to share their financial history with trusted parties (like an auditor) using a special \"view key.\" This concept explains <em>why</em> the ZK-proof solution is the only viable path forward and clarifies the precise strategy Brian Armstrong and Coinbase are pursuing. <strong>The Problem </strong>is that transparent blockchains are a goldmine for AI. As Iron Fish states, \"Every on-chain action, who you pay, when, and how often, creates patterns AI can analyze.\" This allows centralized entities with massive compute power to \"reconstruct your financial identity and behavior,\" reducing users to \"exploitable data points.\" Both the quantum threat and the AI threat are enabled by the same core weakness: <strong>a public, transparent ledger</strong>.</p><p>For a <strong>quantum attack </strong>it needs the <em>public key</em> (revealed during a transaction) to derive the private key. For an <strong>AI Attack </strong>it Needs the <em>public transaction graph</em> (the full history of \"who, what, when\") to build surveillance models. Pure, absolute anonymity (like Monero or the original vision for ZCash) is a non-starter for the mainstream financial world due to strict regulations (Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering). This is the central conflict in crypto: how to get the benefits of privacy without enabling illicit activity?</p><p>Sandy Peng, Co-Founder of Scroll, directly tackles this in her report, 'The Privacy Layer,' arguing that auditable privacy is especially crucial for stablecoins. She reasons that stablecoins are rapidly becoming the foundation for onchain finance and digital money, but their current public nature prevents widespread adoption by institutions and mainstream users who require confidentiality <em>and</em> regulatory compliance. Peng posits that integrating auditable privacy into stablecoins is the key to unlocking their potential as the next generation of trusted digital money. This concept then unifies all the topics: the quantum threat, the AI threat, her core thesis, and Brian Armstrong's strategy.</p><p>In short, you are witnessing the convergence of a single strategy: The ZK-proofs that protect from future quantum computers are the <em>same</em> ZK-proofs that protect from today's AI surveillance, and the 'auditable privacy' layer built on top is what makes it possible for regulated companies like Coinbase to deploy solutions like private, compliant stablecoins at scale.</p><hr/><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1952427668135178664\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1952427668135178664</a></li><li><a href=\"https://usethebitcoin.com/news/base-network-to-get-private-stablecoin-transactions/\" target=\"_blank\">https://usethebitcoin.com/news/base-network-to-get-private-stablecoin-tr...</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/23/the-future-of-crypto-depends-on-auditable-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/23/the-future-of-cry...</a></li></ul><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/time-to-get-tactically-defensive?post=530554\">Time To Get Tactically Defensive </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/america-at-a-crossroads-build-like-china-or-fall-behind?post=530453\">America At A Crossroads: Build Like China Or Fall Behind </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/this-week-in-markets-earnings-inflation-and-geopolitical-shifts?post=530362\">This Week In Markets: Earnings, Inflation, And Geopolitical Shifts </a></p></div>",

This market is projected to reach USD 584.9 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.7%.<sup>2</sup> Global electricity demand from data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, with U.S. data centers anticipated to account for nearly half of the growth in electricity demand, contributing over 20% to the overall growth.<sup>3</sup></p><p>To meet the growing energy demands of data centers and other technology-driven applications,<sup>4</sup> U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase by 25% by 2030 and by 78% by 2050, compared to 2023 levels.<sup>5</sup> This growth could have significant implications for the reliability and affordability of electricity, highlighting the urgency of building a robust power system. Research indicates that investments in U.S. power infrastructure are expected to total USD 1 trillion from 2025 through 2029.<sup>6</sup></p><p>The substantial capital flowing into these infrastructure segments has attracted market attention, as their utilization rate will likely be an early sign of the fortunes of AI and its impact on the global economy. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices aligns with this trend by offering two indices that track these areas: the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-data-center-tower-reit-and-communications-equipment-index\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-us-power-infrastructure-select-index\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P U.S. Power Infrastructure Select Index</a>.</p><h3><br/><strong>S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</strong></h3><p>The S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index measures the performance of developed market-domiciled, U.S.-listed organizations involved in the ownership and management of data centers, telecommunication towers and related equipment.</p><p>This index employs FactSet’s Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) Focus data to select relevant companies, which are organized into two tiers: Data Center and Tower REITs, accounting for approximately 53% of the index, and Communication Equipment, comprising about 47% as of Sept. 20, 2025.</p><p>The index includes 25 constituents, with a substantial 94% weight attributed to U.S.-domiciled companies (see Exhibit 1).

At writing, Comcast stock is up nearly 200% versus its April low.</p><h2><br/>What Trump might have against a Comcast-WBD deal</h2><p>Experts aren’t entirely convinced that a potential Comcast-WBD merger will succeed in securing regulatory approval under the Trump administration.</p><p>Why? Because the President’s disdain for the company and its co-chief executive, Brian Roberts, is well-documented.</p><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/trump-slams-msnbc-comcast-ceo-155801595.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump called Roberts a “lowlife”</a> and denounced Comcast as “ a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting” on Truth Social – animosity that analysts suspect could translate into regulatory resistance.  </p><p>Blair Levin of New Street Research, for example, told clients in his latest research note that “it is almost certain that the Trump DOJ would not allow CMCSA to buy WBD and the result would be decided in court.”</p><p>Trump’s criticism appears rooted in his perception that Comcast’s media properties – particularly MSNBC and CNN – are left-leaning or hostile to his administration.</p><h2><br/>Does it mean CMCSA wouldn’t bid for WBD?</h2><p>Not necessarily. Comcast executives reportedly believe the aforementioned regulatory risks are actually overstated or premature.</p><p>In fact, according to anonymous sources, the company is weighing its options. One potential workaround could involve excluding CNN from the deal or divesting it post-acquisition.</p><p>Comcast’s donation to Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom initiative via the Trust for the National Mall may also be a strategic gesture to build goodwill.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-listed firm is already spinning off MSNBC into Versant – a move that may further help mitigate concerns.</p><p>Given the strategic value of WBD assets, Comcast’s leadership may also bet that President Trump’s reputation as a dealmaker will ultimately override his public grievances.</p><h2><br/>Is Comcast stock worth buying without WBD?</h2><p>Investors should note, however, that Comcast shares remain worth owning heading into 2026 – even without WBD – given the company’s fundamentals remain compelling.</p><p>On Thursday, the mass media and entertainment conglomerate reported market-beating financials for its third quarter, with a 45% year-on-year increase in free cash flow to $4.9 billion.</p><p>CMCSA stock is currently going for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 7 which makes it all the more attractive for long-term investors.</p><p>A lucrative <a href=\"https://invezz.com/stocks/best/top-dividend-stocks/\">dividend</a> yield of 4.87% makes up for another great reason to invest in Comcast today.</p><p>Wall Street also currently has a consensus “overweight” rating on CMCSA with a mean target of about $39, indicating potential upside of nearly 50% from here.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/msft-meta-stock-sink-on-ai-spending-plans-analyst-view-only-one-as-buy?post=531979\">MSFT, META Stock Sink On AI Spending Plans: Analyst View Only One As Buy </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/snap-ceo-downplays-metas-smart-glasses-our-ar-glasses-will-be-infinitely-more-capable?post=531650\">Snap CEO Downplays Meta’s Smart Glasses: ‘Our AR Glasses Will Be Infinitely More Capable’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-vs-microsoft-stock-as-both-hit-40-trillion-market-cap?post=531145\">Apple Vs Microsoft Stock As Both Hit $4.0 Trillion Market Cap </a></p></div>",

The year-over-year growth rate in the CPI has now increased for six months in a row.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20sept%2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This suggests there is significant upward pressure on prices. </p><p>This is echoed by the so-called “core” CPI which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core CPI was up in September, month over month, by 0.22 percent. Core CPI growth has not gone down, month over month, in 64 months.</p><p>Measured year-over year, September’s core CPI was up by 3.0 percent, and has been above three percent for three months. Indeed, core CPI year-over-year inflation has only dipped below 2 percent during three months of the past 53 months. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20core%20sept.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Although the Federal Reserve claims to have a target CPI inflation rate of 2 percent, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Fed isn’t actually trying very hard to hit the target rate. </p><p>After all, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure measure, also shows that price inflation hasn’t fallen to two percent or below two percent since February of 2021.  The August PCE measure (the most recent available number) was up 2.7 percent, year over year, while the core PCE increase for August was 2.9 percent. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/PCE.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The Fed, of course, has had to provide excuses for why it is so bad at getting price inflation back down to its target. After all, aren’t we told that the Fed is filled with the world’s best analysts and economists? The explanation given nowadays is that tariffs are pushing prices up, and so it’s really the fault of the administration. This may be a savvy move politically, but it’s bad economics. Price inflation is caused by monetary inflation, and not by tariffs, “Putin’s price hike,” or by logistical problems. The Fed likes to blame price inflation on everything but the real cause, which is monetary inflation—an increasing money supply. Only an increasing money supply can create <em>general </em>price increases in the economy in which prices for rents, food, energy, services, etc rise in aggregate. It is only when the money supply rises that prices generally rise across the whole economy. </p><p>Yet, even by the federal government’s own CPI measure—which tends to downplay the real impact of price inflation—we see overall price increases. Yes, some prices fall here and there in the CPI report, as we now see in used cars and energy. But the index is up overall. This is possible because monetary inflation means that when prices rise in some areas, there is still extra money sloshing around that is available to keep bidding up prices across the board. </p><p>Without a rising money supply, on the other hand, prices could not rise across the economy <em>in general</em> because rising prices in some areas would reduce the money available for spending in other areas. That is, price deflation in some areas would fully offset price inflation in other areas, and we would not see any significant general price inflation.</p><p>If price increases were merely the result of tariffs, we would indeed see price increased in goods that rely on imported parts, or which are imported as finished goods. However, if the money supply were stable, increased spending on imports would lead to<em> less</em> spending—and falling prices— in other areas. </p><p>That’s not happening. Rather, we continue to see significant increases in prices across the economy, in general, so we can’t blame this on tariffs, or oil prices, or any foreign war. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-national-debt-soars-past-38-trillion?post=531166\">The National Debt Soars Past $38 Trillion</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/no-tariffs-did-not-cause-septembers-budget-surplus?post=530804\">No, Tariffs Did Not Cause September’s Budget Surplus</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-federal-reserve-cut-rates-so-the-rich-get-richer?post=523742\">The Federal Reserve Cut Rates So The Rich Get Richer </a></p></div>",

General Motors rose to a high of $70.2, up by 70% from its lowest level in April when Donald Trump launched his trade war. This recovery has brought its market capitalization to over $64 billion.</p><h2><br/>Stable revenue growth and pivot from the EV business </h2><p>General Motors stock price has done well after publishing its financial results last week.</p><p>The company, which is the parent company of brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac, is doing well in a difficult market environment.</p><p>Its revenue came in at $48.5 billion in the last quarter, largely flat from what it made in the same period last year. This happened as the company achieved the highest third-quarter market share in the US and returned its Chinese business to profitability.</p><p>Its profitability was affected by the ongoing external issues such as tariffs that Donald Trump implemented on imports. As a result, its net income margin plunged to 2.7% from the previous 6.3%, while the automotive operating cash flow fell to $6 billion.</p><p>The main reason why the GM stock surged is that the company admitted that it will not be the next Tesla. It now expects to fully focus on the ICE business, which is doing well and which it has a leading market share in the US. The CEO <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/static-files/51db67b7-798b-4ae3-9486-1a2228bdfc66\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s clear that ICE volumes will remain higher for longer. We lead the industry today, and we are increasingly well-positioned to meet strong, sustained demand.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>GM, like other traditional companies, were quick to pivot to the electric vehicle industry after witnessing Tesla’s robust growth. It launched EVZ brands of its top vehicles, including the Hammer, Bolt, Buick, and Cadillac.

Only Cadillac EVs are doing relatively well, but it is unclear whether the growth will continue.</p><p>Play Video -</p><p>GM stock price has jumped because of the latest talks between the US and China, which have yielded some major breakthroughs. For example, the company can now operate without worrying substantially about rare earth materials and magnets.</p><p>Also, the company may benefit from an improved US-China relationship as it still has a large presence there.</p><p>Analysts expect the GM’s revenue will stagnate in the next few years. The average estimate for this year’s revenue is $185.83 billion, down by 0.86% from last year. </p><p>Analysts expect that its revenue will remain at $185.82 billion next year.

The big reason that some of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsofts-cloud-surge-lifts-revenue-above-expectations-2025-10-29/\" target=\"_blank\">financial press was reporting</a> was that investors were concerned about overspending on capital expenditures, or AI.</p><p>The concern is that<strong> too much spending now could hurt short-term profitability</strong>, particularly in an environment where <strong>AI stocks could be in a bubble and the AI boom could fizzle</strong> due to uncertainty over the true ROI of AI investments.</p><p>While this may be true for many companies, it is <strong>probably not the case with Microsoft, the second largest cloud computing company</strong> behind Amazon. This is one <strong>area where AI spending is critical</strong> to meet the massive AI spending.</p><p>After the <strong>initial knee-jerk selloff</strong>, Microsoft stock started climbing back on what really was an excellent earnings report. As of 10 a.m. ET, Microsoft stock was only down about 2%. Wall Street analysts mostly recognized the strength of the results and tuned out the noise, as many of them raised Microsoft’s price target post-earnings.</p><h2><br/>It really was a good quarter for Microsoft</h2><p>Overall, Microsoft <strong>turned in a strong quarter</strong> in the fiscal first quarter that ended September 30. The Magnificent 7 firm posted strong gains and easily topped analysts’ expectations.</p><ul><li><strong>Revenue</strong>: $77.7B, up 17% year-over-year. This beat consensus estimates of $75.3B in revenue.</li><li><strong>Net income</strong>: $27.7B, up 12% year-over-year.</li><li><strong>Operating income</strong>: $38B, up 24% year-over-year.</li><li><strong>Earnings</strong>: $3.72 per share, up 13% year-over-year.</li><li><strong>Adjusted earnings</strong>: $4.13 per share, up 23% year-over-year. This beat estimates of $3.66 per share.</li></ul><p>“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,” Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said. <strong>“It’s why we continue to increase our investments in AI</strong> across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.”</p><p>The big driver for Microsoft was its cloud business, specifically its Azure cloud computing segment.</p><p>Overall, <strong>Microsoft Cloud generated $49.1 billion in revenue, up 26% year-over-year</strong>. In addition, the remaining performance obligation (RPO), or work under contract in the pipeline, increased 51% to $392 billion.</p><p>Within the overall cloud business, Intelligent Cloud, which is its AI cloud computing business, saw revenue increase by 28%. <strong>Azure, which is its major AI cloud computing platform, saw revenue climb 40% in the quarter</strong>.</p><p>Part of that pipeline is <strong>filled by OpenAI</strong>, which just signed a new contract with Microsoft to <strong>acquire $250 billion in Azure cloud </strong>computing services.</p><p>The concerns over AI spending stemmed from a <strong>record $34.9 billion in capital expenditures last quarter</strong>, which was higher than expected.</p><p>CFO Amy Hood said it was to meet growing demand, and it will be even higher this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year.</p><blockquote><p>With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we’re increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25,” Hood said.</p></blockquote><p><br/>Investors should tune out the short-term noise, as AI spending by one of the leading cloud computing companies with booming growth should not be a long-term concern. In fact, it is just the opposite.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/one-of-the-best-ai-stocks-just-got-better-after-blowout-earnings?post=531538\">One Of The Best AI Stocks Just Got Better After Blowout Earnings</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/ai-bubble-ark-invests-cathie-wood-weighs-in?post=531157\">AI Bubble?

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gray High Rise Buildings\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/936722/pexels-photo-936722.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/gray-high-rise-buildings-936722/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>The European Central Bank is moving forward with its digital euro plans, targeting a launch date of 2029. However, key decisions remain pending as lawmakers and officials continue to debate the legal and political groundwork needed to make the project viable across the Eurozone. With concerns about privacy, competition, and dependency on non-European payment systems, the ECB is accelerating its efforts despite ongoing political disagreements.</p><h2><br/>Legal Framework Still Pending as ECB Concludes Preparation Phase</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://x.com/kyledoops/status/1983798556998910168\">European Central Bank (ECB)</a> is expected to conclude its current preparation phase for the digital euro at the end of October 2025. According to sources cited by Bloomberg, officials will meet this week in Florence, Italy, to decide on the next steps.</p><p>Preparatory work for the digital euro started in late 2023, following earlier studies that began in 2020. ECB Board Member Piero Cipollone recently stated that mid-2029 is a likely launch window if legal approval is secured by 2026. Cipollone explained that a digital euro would give Europeans access to a stable digital payment method, especially in times of crisis such as war or cyberattacks.</p><h2><br/>Lawmakers Still Divided on Digital Euro Adoption</h2><p>Despite progress in technical planning, the digital euro still faces political resistance. Legislation has been under review in the <a href=\"https://x.com/coinbureau/status/1983509366515917278\">European</a> Parliament since 2023 but has seen delays, particularly around the 2024 elections.</p><p>Many lawmakers, member states, banks, and consumers have raised concerns about privacy and digital surveillance. The lack of agreement has slowed down formal approval. ECB officials hope lawmakers will finalize the legal framework within the next four years.</p><p>Last month, finance ministers from EU member states agreed on a roadmap for the digital euro, including setting limits on individual holdings. Cipollone called this agreement a “breakthrough,” as it addresses one of the key concerns surrounding the project.</p><h2><br/>Digital Currency Seen as Counter to Foreign Payment Dependence</h2><p>Policymakers are increasingly worried about Europe’s reliance on foreign payment firms such as Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal. The <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/russias-central-bank-allows-banks-to-engage-in-crypto-operations-with-limits/\">ECB’s digital euro</a> aims to reduce this dependency by providing a public digital alternative that is accessible to all EU residents.</p><p>Officials are also watching the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins, which some fear could weaken the Eurozone’s monetary sovereignty. The digital euro is being seen as one way to push back against the growing influence of private and foreign-controlled payment networks.</p><p>Some countries in the Eurozone are also pushing for faster adoption to catch up with global developments. However, without a legal mandate from the European Parliament, the ECB cannot move forward with full-scale implementation.</p><h2><br/>Global CBDC Development Still Limited, But Growing</h2><p>According to the Atlantic Council, only three countries have fully launched central bank digital currencies: Nigeria, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. An additional 49 countries are currently in the pilot phase.</p><p>The Human Rights Foundation also tracks <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/deutsche-bank-predicts-central-banks-may-hold-bitcoin-by-2030/\">CBDC</a> development and notes that digital currencies can improve payment systems and promote financial access. Still, critics warn that these currencies could reduce privacy and increase government oversight of personal finances.</p><p>The United States remains cautious in its approach. The Federal Reserve has not committed to a retail CBDC, citing the need for political backing and legislative approval. Instead, the U.S. has focused on regulating stablecoins, especially since the introduction of the GENIUS Act in July 2025.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/services/visa-expands-crypto-push-with-mysterious-blockchain-integration-plan?post=531522\">Visa Expands Crypto Push With Mysterious Blockchain Integration Plan</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/149m-inflows-into-bitcoin-etfs-amid-price-dip-will-the-trend-hold?post=531176\">$149M Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs Amid Price Dip: Will The Trend Hold?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nvidia-corporation-stock-gains-498-after-unveiling-nvqlink-quantum-supercomputing-platform?post=531153\">Nvidia Corporation Stock: Gains 4.98% After Unveiling NVQLink Quantum Supercomputing Platform</a><br/></div>",

This rebound comes as investors digest the latest earnings reports from domestic and international companies, alongside fresh regional economic data. Additionally, market participants are evaluating the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut and its guidance on future monetary policy. </p><p>Among the standout performers, Standard Chartered rose by 2.2% on the back of a stronger quarterly profit and an upgraded income and return outlook. The bank reported a profit of $1.03 billion attributable to ordinary shareholders, a 10% increase from $931 million in the same period last year. Basic earnings per share also climbed 7.7%, reaching 44.5 US cents compared to 36.8 US cents a year ago. Airtel Africa continued its upward momentum, gaining 3.2% after a strong performance in the previous session. Other companies, including Auto Trader Group, EasyJet, Sainsbury's, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Games Workshop, Tesco, and BP, posted gains ranging from 0.4% to 1%.</p><p>However, not all stocks fared well.WPP suffered a sharp 14% drop after cutting its growth forecasts. The advertising giant reported declining revenue for both Q3 and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, citing weaker performance across all regions and business segments. The company now expects like-for-like revenue growth, excluding pass-through costs, to shrink by 5.5% to 6%, compared to its earlier forecast of a 3% to 5% decline. In Q3, WPP's total group revenue fell to £3.26 billion, an 8.4% year-on-year decrease on a reported basis and a 3.5% drop on a like-for-like basis. The company has adjusted its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, reflecting ongoing challenges.</p><p>Shell PLC delivered strong Q3 results, reporting $5.3 billion in income attributable to shareholders—up from $3.6 billion in Q2 and $4.3 billion a year earlier. Adjusted earnings reached $5.4 billion, while adjusted EBITDA surged to $14.8 billion.Computacenter maintained its growth trajectory in Q3, driven by robust performance in North America, improvements in the UK, and a return to growth in Germany, solidifying its positive momentum. HALEON reaffirmed its 2025 organic revenue growth target of approximately 3.5%, slightly exceeding analyst expectations despite mixed Q3 results across various regions. Drax Group announced plans to acquire three battery energy storage projects for £157.2 million. The acquisition will add 260MW of storage capacity across Scotland and England, with payments staggered through 2028. Vodafone Group announced its acquisition of Skaylink GmbH, a specialist in cloud and digital transformation, for €175 million in a deal with Waterland-managed funds.

Trends in Minneapolis are not available.</p><p><br/><strong>RICE</strong></p><p>General Comments: Rice was about lower yesterday with selling coming from news that the US and many Southeast Asia countries including China have come to trade deals t that do not include Rice this week.  The recent selling has been to be relentless and appears tied to the weaker prices in Asia and especially India.  Trends are down in the market.  The harvest is wrapping up in Texas and southern Louisiana.  Harvest is now wrapping up in Mississippi and Arkansas.  California is also about done with its harvest.  Yields and quality are mixed, but quality appears better than a year ago.  The cash market has been slow with low bids from buyers in domestic markets and average or less export demand.</p><p>Chart Analysis: Trends are mixed.  Support is at 988, 974, and 962 November and resistance is at 1057, 1098, and 1126 November.</p><p><br/><strong>CORN AND OATS</strong></p><p>General Comments: Corn was mixed yesterday on news that the US government has made trade deals with many Southeast Asia nations including China.  Trends are sideways to up in the market.  Most USDA reports are cancelled as the government is still closed.  The harvest is active in all areas of the Midwest.  There are ideas that US production might not be super strong due to disease such as rust to offset the demand losses.  Yield reports are showing at or above APH yields in western areas, with very good crops reported in Minnesota.  Yields have been reported at or less than APH in areas east of the Mississippi River.  Temperatures should average near to above normal this week and there are forecasts for mostly dry conditions.  Most of the western Midwest has seen adequate or greater precipitation and production ideas are high.  Areas east of the Mississippi River have been very dry for the last month or more.  Demand for Corn in world markets remains moderate to strong.  Oats were lower.</p><p>Chart Analysis:  Trends in Corn are mixed to up.  Support is at 427, 425, and 419 December, and resistance is at 442, 450, and 456 December.  Trends in Oats are down.  Support is at 270, 267, and 264 December, and resistance is at 298, 304, and 310 December.</p><p><br/><strong>SOYBEANS</strong></p><p>General Comments: Soybeans and Soybean Meal were mostly a little lower yesterday on some long liquidation after President Trump met with Xi of China and cut a deal with the Chinese this week.  Soybean Oil was lower.  Wire reports yesterday indicated that China bought 3 cargoes of Soybeans in the last couple of days.  Trump says that China has agreed to buy 12 million tons of Soybeans this year and 25 million each year for the next three years, but this is hard to believe since China only has one or two months’ worth of Soybeans to buy for this year and prices are cheaper in South America.  The US has concluded trade deals with many Southeast Asian nations this week, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia.  Malaysia also cut aa deal on Cocoa trade with the US.  The US government has announced that it will support farmers with about 3.0 billion dollars even with the government closed but so far no money has been flowing.  Forecasts call for showers and rains to be seen in the Midwest this week.  Temperatures will average near normal.  Export demand remains less for US Soybeans as China has been taking almost all the export from South America due to the Trump tariff regime.  Ag Rural said that Brazil is now 36% planted for Soybeans.</p><p>Analysis:  Trends in Soybeans are up.  Support is at 1063, 1052, and 1045 November, and resistance is at 1100, 1112, and  1124 November.  Trends in Soybean Meal are up.  Support is at 300.00, 295.00, and 290.00 December, and resistance is at 313.00, 316.00, and 319.00 December.  Trends in Soybean Oil are mixed.  Support is at 4920, 4890, and 4770 December, with resistance at 5180, 5220, and 5390 December.</p><p><br/><strong>PALM OIL AND CANOLA</strong></p><p>General Comments: Palm Oil futures were a little lower last week in sympathy with the price action in Crude Oil and Soybean Oil.  Futures were lower today.  The market sentiment overall is turning bearish on ideas of increasing stocks to the market and on some concerns about Indian demand   Canola was a little higher again as Canada and China agreed to negotiate trade issues that have included a ban on imports of Canadian Canola by China.  Trends are mixed on the daily charts and on the weekly charts.</p><p>Chart Analysis: Trends in Canola are mixed.  Support is at 612.00, 608.00, and 597.00 November, with resistance at 630.00, 640.00, and 644.00 November.  Trends in Palm Oil are mixed to down.  Support is at 4240, 4210, and 4150 January, with resistance at 4410, 4490, and 4570 January.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/softs-report-wednesday-oct-29?post=531435\">Softs Report -

Here's what to watch for:</p><p><br/><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>During the company's last earnings call, Amazon said it saw Q3 revenue of $174B-$179.5B, with consensus at the time of $173.2B. \"This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $15.5B and $20.5B, compared with $17.4B in the third quarter 2024. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded,\" the company added.</p><p>Current consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Amazon's third quarter stand at $1.56 and $177.76B, respectively, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Amazon's full year 2025 stand at $6.65 and $708.84B, respectively.</p><p><br/><strong>BULLISH ON AMAZON: </strong>Last week, KeyBanc resumed coverage of Amazon.com with an Overweight rating and $300 price target. Advertising is fueling gains in the company's retail business, which provides a path forward for grocery becoming more material over the medium term, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Investors have also become too pessimistic on the Cloud business, and the firm sees potential for improving growth into 2026, KeyCorp added.</p><p><br/><strong>AWS GROWTH RATE: </strong>UBS raised the firm's price target on Amazon.com to $279 from $271, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares ahead of the Q3 earnings report on October 30. The firm expects some \"noise\" in the Q3 reported operating income, and its headline guidance for OI may be below consensus. That said, UBS believes focus will likely be on the reported AWS growth rate, and expectations are at 18% year over year with prospects for potentially greater acceleration shifting into Q4 2025 and 2026.</p><p>Stifel also raised the firm's price target on Buy-rated Amazon.com to $269 from $260 as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results in e-commerce. The management's commentary in Q2 that average sales prices had not risen materially remained the case in Q3, leaving the firm's estimates unchanged based on perceived stability in consumer spend, and the expansion of Same-Day grocery delivery for Prime members may leave some upside for 2026, the firm tells investors in a research note.</p><p><br/><strong>INCREMENTALLY BULLISH: </strong>Wells Fargo is incrementally bullish on Amazon following g update that Project Rainier is now live and doubling scale by year-end 2025. Estimate Project Rainier now contributes $8.2B vs $6.7B prior to 2026 AWS revenue, incremental 70bps year-over-year growth. Wells reiterates an Overweight rating on Amazon.</p><p><br/><strong>WORKFORCE:</strong> Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said in a memo to employees, \"I want to let you know that we're making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates. There will be communications from leaders to those teams and individuals today, but we also wanted to share the broader context about what's happening and why. Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams - explaining how we want to operate like the world's largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers. Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We're already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you've done. The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs. While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles. We're working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted, including offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and our recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon. For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.\"</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/heres-what-wall-st-experts-are-saying-about-these-media-names-ahead-of-results?post=531544\">Here's What Wall St. Experts Are Saying About These Media Names Ahead Of Results </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/heres-what-wall-st-experts-are-saying-about-meta-ahead-of-earnings?post=531529\">Here's What Wall St. Experts Are Saying About Meta Ahead Of Earnings </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/wall-street-more-bullish-on-alphabet-ahead-of-earnings?post=531429\">Wall Street More Bullish On Alphabet Ahead Of Earnings </a><br/></div>",

Washington agreed to cut tariffs on certain Chinese imports from 57% to 47%, while Beijing committed to resume purchases of US soybeans and to lift restrictions on rare-earth exports to the US. This diplomatic easing has supported the US Dollar (USD) and slightly weighed on Oil prices earlier in the day, before they recovered.</p><p>Meanwhile, US sanctions on Russian producer Rosneft have reignited tensions in Europe. In Germany, the government is considering nationalizing the company’s local subsidiary, which operates a key refinery supplying most of Berlin’s fuel. The US Treasury, however, granted a temporary exemption until April 2026, giving Berlin time to seek a foreign buyer.</p><p>On the monetary front, the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to a range of 3.75%-4.00% and announced that Quantitative Tightening (QT) will end on December 1. Nonetheless, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a more hawkish tone than expected, saying that another rate cut in December is “far from a foregone conclusion.” His remarks pushed US Treasury yields higher and strengthened the USD, limiting Crude Oil’s upside.</p><p>Finally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) are considering a modest output increase in December, continuing their gradual monthly hikes to regain market share. This <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast\">outlook</a>, combined with the firmer USD, keeps investors cautious and maintains Oil prices close to the $60 mark.</p><h2><br/>WTI Technical Analysis: Faces key test at $60.40 resistance amid fragile rebound</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"WTI price chart\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-screenshot%20(65)-1761841472024-1761841472025.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><small>WTI US Oil 4-hour chart.

The subsequent rebound is now attempting to break above a descending resistance line around $60.40 coming from the October 24 peak at $62.38, although a confirmed breakout is still needed before signaling stronger bullish momentum.</p><p>A decisive move above this resistance would likely reinforce the upward bias and pave the way for a test of the psychological $61.00 level. Sustained strength beyond that point could extend the recovery toward $62.00, with the next notable resistance at the October 24 high of $62.38.</p><p>On the downside, a clear break below the $59.50 support and the 100-period SMA at $59.37 would invalidate the current rebound and expose WTI to renewed downside pressure.

Microsoft saw big gains in its Azure and AI segment as it ironed out a new deal with OpenAI that has been a cause of concern among the two giants.</p><h3><br/><strong>Microsoft’s Financials</strong></h3><p>Microsoft’s first quarter revenues grew 18% to $77.67 billion, beating analyst estimates of $75.33 billion. EPS of $4.13 also exceeded analyst estimates of $3.67 per share.</p><p>Its Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, saw revenues grow 28% to $30.9 billion, ahead of the market’s estimate of $30.25 billion. Azure reported a growth of 38% during the quarter. Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered revenues of $33 billion compared with the estimate of $32.33 billion. The More Personal Computing unit saw revenues grow 4% to $13.8 billion, ahead of the $12.83 billion consensus.</p><p>Microsoft did not provide estimates. The market expects revenues of $79.73 billion and an EPS of $3.78 for the second quarter. For the current fiscal year, revenues are expected to be $321.25 billion with an EPS of $15.40.</p><h3><br/><strong>Microsoft’s OpenAI Partnership</strong></h3><p>During the year, Microsoft and OpenAI have had<a href=\"https://www.sramanamitra.com/2025/07/31/microsoft-and-openai-deal-with-partnership-issues/\"> partnership issues</a>, and some of those are likely to be resolved in the coming year. Earlier this week, OpenAI announced a restructuring that converted it to a for-profit business from an earlier nonprofit standing. OpenAI’s for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC. Under the new structure, Microsoft, which had invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, now holds 27% of the company valued at $135 billion.</p><p>Despite the change in structure, OpenAI will remain Microsoft’s frontier model partner and Microsoft will continue to have exclusive IP rights and Azure API exclusivity until Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). One of the key points of contention in the deal has been the trigger when OpenAI achieves AGI status. As per the new rules, once AGI is declared by OpenAI, the declaration will be verified by an independent expert panel.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft’s IP rights</a> for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now include models post-AGI. Microsoft’s IP rights to research will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030. Microsoft can also now independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with other third parties. In exchange, OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, but Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider. The deal now keeps the two firms working together until 2032 at least. Prior to the deal, OpenAI was constrained in its ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts. The requirement that OpenAI rely exclusively on Microsoft for computational resources was one of the big areas of concern for OpenAI.</p><p>Besides its OpenAI partnership, Microsoft remains committed to AI investment. For the three months ended September, Microsoft reported spending nearly $35 billion on new projects especially data centers. Currently, the demand for Microsoft’s cloud computing services far exceeds its available data centers, hence the rush for expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>My Take</strong></h3><p>Microsoft and OpenAI have concluded a deal until 2032. This tells me their AGI timeline is 3-8 years. Good to know. Governments better get UBI figured out in that timeframe or social unrest will destabilize society completely.</p><p>On the upside, medical and scientific research should explode and accelerate the cure for all diseases scenario. Personalized tutoring, mentoring, education and healthcare should also scale rapidly.</p><p>Its stock is currently trading at $541.55 with a market capitalization of $4.03 trillion. It hit a 52-week high of $555.45 yesterday after results. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $344.79 that it had fallen to in April this year.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-socks-analysis-of-ibms-cognitus-acquisition?post=530304\">Cloud Socks: Analysis Of IBM’s Cognitus Acquisition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-continues-to-monetize-beyond-streaming?post=529815\">Netflix Continues To Monetize Beyond Streaming </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-stocks-asml-rides-high-on-ai-boom?post=529128\">Cloud Stocks: ASML Rides High On AI Boom</a><br/></div>",

Indeed, Tuesday had the worst breadth for an up day of any day since 1990! What that means is that the strength in the mega caps outweighed weakness across the rest of the S&amp;P.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1790.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This weak market breadth places extra weight on the earnings reports of the Magnificent 7. In focus today is META which is currently down almost 9% in the premarket after guiding to a huge increase in expenses in 2026.</p><p>2025 expenses are forecast to come in between $116-$118 billion, representing a 22%-24% increase from 2024. And here’s what META said about 2026:</p><blockquote><p>We anticipate total expenses will grow at a <strong><em>significantly faster percentage rate</em></strong> in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, and add technical talent in priority areas</p></blockquote><p><br/>Let’s do some hypothetical calculations. If 2025 total expenses come in at $117 billion that would represent a 23% increase over total expenses of $95 billion in 2024. And 2026 total expenses will grow at a “significantly faster percentage rate” than the 23% in 2025. Let’s say that means 33% which would work out to $155 billion. Obviously that kind of increase in expenses is going to crush META’s margins and profitability. I’m all for investing for the long term but clearly these numbers are making Wall Street nervous.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sc-2025-10-30T050908.866-1024x609.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Last, I’ve been waiting to comment on the mini crash in gold and the gold miners. Personally, I used it as a buying opportunity for a couple of reasons. One, the <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GDX\">GDX</a> seems to be finding support at its 50 DMA which makes this look like a standard correction in an ongoing bull market.</p><p>Two, fundamentally the miners are essentially printing money with gold around $4000/oz. In its 3Q25 earnings report last week, Newmont (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NEM\">NEM</a>) reported an almost $2000 per ounce margin between its average realized gold price ($3539) and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. ($1566). As a result, Adjusted EBITDA increased 68% from 3Q24 to $3.3 billion. If they can maintain this, they’re looking at about $14 billion in Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis with an $87 billion market cap or a 6x multiple.</p><p>The same thing applies to Agnico Eagle (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AEM\">AEM</a>) which reported 3Q25 earnings Wednesday afternoon. AEM’s average realized gold price was $3476 and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. $1373. That resulted in a 67% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $2.1 billion. Once again, with a market cap of $79 billion, the valuation here remains very attractive.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-hold-onto-cat-despite-it-being-technically-overextended-and-fundamentally-overvalued?post=531493\">Why Hold Onto CAT Despite It Being Technically Overextended And Fundamentally Overvalued</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/bulls-back-in-charge-unh-continue-to-ride-with-uncle-warren-pypl-breakout-or-fakeout?post=531143\">Bulls Back In Charge, UNH: Continue To Ride With Uncle Warren, PYPL: Breakout Or Fakeout?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bonds/the-state-of-the-market-the-debate-over-interest-rates-gold-crash?post=529964\">The State Of The Market; The Debate Over Interest Rates; Gold Crash </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"The AI Arms Dealer: Nvidia’s Path to $5 Trillion and Beyond\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/93291902_m-646x360.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://123rf.com/\">123rf.com</a></em></p><p><br/>In late 2024, we posited that AI is not a bubble—centered on Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>)—given the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/nvidia-and-the-ai-bubble-is-it-real/\">concerted effort</a> to make AI happen. Namely, through unprecedented public-private partnerships (PPPs). Subsequent capital flows into energy and data centers have only strengthened that thesis.<br/><br/>For investors, this consolidation of influence and infrastructure flows directly through Nvidia, serving as the de facto arms dealer of the AI era, underpinning every AI model and data center needed to drive this transformation.<br/><br/>Now that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company on Wednesday, let’s examine if there is room for even more growth, or if this is an imminent prelude to bubble-popping.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Real Logic Behind AI Investing</strong></h3><p>Beyond AI’s commercial applications for content generation and productivity boosts, AI represents the holy grail of governance. Human-centric governance tends to be inconsistent, reactive, noisy, and to have a high overhead. In contrast, AI-centric governance has the potential to integrate vast data streams from economics, social behavior, and infrastructure in real time.</p><p>This comes hand in hand with policy simulation outcomes and continuous improvement enabled by machine learning. Most importantly, AI gives tiny groups multiplicative power, allowing them to exert their will on a scale otherwise impossible. This process is already underway, with <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/palantir-pltr-the-emerging-digital-nervous-system-of-u-s-government/\">tight coordination among OpenAI, Palantir, and Larry Ellison’s Oracle.</a></p><p>Such is the public-private level coordination revolving AI that Harvard economist Jason Furman <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284\" target=\"_blank\">calculated </a>that cutting the AI-related investments would’ve resulted in an annualized GDP growth of only 0.1% for the first half of 2025.</p><p>According to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI), corporate AI investments reached $252.3 billion in 2024, more than 8x the $31.2 billion in 2022, when the AI hype began. Yet, September’s Gartner research points to $1.5 trillion in worldwide AI spending in 2025, putting the last year to shame.</p><h3><br/><strong>Is Circular Financing a Concern?</strong></h3><p>Although the “AI is not a bubble” thesis has played out as expected so far, there is still a concern of overplaying the narrative itself. In other words, mistaking coordinated industrial policy for organic market demand, where rising valuations justify escalating capital commitments in a self-reinforcing loop.</p><p>This concern became more pressing when Nvidia pledged up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data centers on September 22nd. Nvidia’s rival, AMD, soon joined the OpenAI partnership with a $34 billion pledge on October 6th, contributing its MI300X and MI350X chip series.</p><p>Yet, this represents only a tiny portion of overall circular financing between Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, OpenAI, Coreweave, and data center leasing.</p><p>Wall Street analysts are already likening this circular capital flow to the dot-com bubble building up in the late 1990s, which burst in March 2020. In the most recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, the co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, noted that:</p><blockquote><p>“Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>However, just as investing in the internet turned out to be justified, the same is the case for AI commitments, according to Gates:</p><blockquote><p>“But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they’ll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>Nonetheless, despite the circular financing—an artifact of coordination to bring AI to fruition—Nvidia still has room for improvement.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Nvidia GPU and Energy Bottlenecks</strong></h3><p>On Tuesday, Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) announced it would cut around 14,000 middle managers, representing 4% of its workforce, potentially expanding to 30,000. Long-term, through 2033, Amazon plans to automate 500,000 jobs. As we explored recently, this boosts the company’s bottom line despite the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/why-the-aws-outage-was-good-for-amazons-stock-price/\">recent AWS-related outage</a>.</p><p>At a glance, Amazon’s layoffs fit into the AI narrative, but investors should not mistake them as mono-causal. Throughout 2024, Amazon reported a severe AI GPU shortage in its retail division, to the point that the company launched ‘Project Greenland’ to optimize the allocation of compute resources.</p><p>In Q2 2025, Amazon committed $31.4 billion to AI capital expenditures (capex). For shareholders, this is a bitter, margin-preserving pill to swallow, which has to be offset by cost-cutting—layoffs. In other words, this is likely the primary driver for Amazon’s layoffs, not the AI replacement of human work per se.</p><p>And the willingness to do layoffs points to an ongoing Nvidia GPU shortage across the Big Tech cluster. After all, if Amazon has this problem, the entire Big Tech cluster likely does as well. In turn, Nvidia is expected to continue seeing GPU sales surge.</p><p>Contributing to the $5 trillion market cap milestone, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hinted as much on Tuesday at the GTC conference, when he said he expects half a trillion dollars worth of AI GPU sales. This estimate combines the existing cutting-edge Blackwell chips and the 2026 launch of Rubin chips.</p><p>Previously at July’s CDNLive conference, Jensen also noted that “power generation is going to be a big deal” as existing “power grids aren’t going to be enough to sustain the growth of this industry.”</p><p>This fits into our bullish thesis on <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/nuclear-meets-ai-which-companies-will-reflect-gains-first/\">nuclear power stocks</a>, but it also points to an energy bottleneck. The implication for Nvidia shareholders is that the company’s next challenge is not outcompeting AMD or Intel on performance per watt, but ensuring its customers can obtain those watts in the first place.</p><p>At the same time, as every incremental data center expansion runs up against the physical limits of grid capacity, Nvidia’s bottom line is supported by future scarcity.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/roblox-stock-drops-as-q4-and-full-year-loss-forecasts-disappoint-investors?post=531972\">Roblox Stock Drops As Q4 And Full-Year Loss Forecasts Disappoint Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/eli-lilly-delivers-strong-q3-performance-raises-earnings-outlook?post=531895\">Eli Lilly Delivers Strong Q3 Performance, Raises Earnings Outlook</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

Specifically, the one print that appeared to weigh the heaviest on the tech-centric Nasdaq was <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>), which beat consensus revenue targets but fell short on earnings per share. The culprit? A one-time, tax-related charge, along with increased capital expenditures for this year and next due to artificial-intelligence-related investments.</p><p>META fell sharply during yesterday’s after-hours session, and the decline extended to the current session.</p><p>Obviously, AVGO stock represents an entirely different entity than META. However, the two share the same AI-related catalyst, which, in the case of Broadcom, has led to a robust return of over 61% year-to-date, inclusive of today’s volatility. Over the past 52 weeks, AVGO has gained nearly 112%, a beneficiary of the surge in AI-related spending.</p><p>During the midweek session, the security appeared to enjoy residual tailwinds from a partnership involving the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), and <strong>Oracle</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ORCL\">ORCL</a>). Under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-partnership-nvidia-and-oracle-build-largest-doe-ai\">landmark deal</a>, the partnership will deliver the DOE’s largest AI supercomputer and accelerate scientific discovery.</p><p>While Broadcom wasn’t mentioned in the press release, such large-scale catalysts may reasonably extend to other major AI players, thereby lifting AVGO stock. However, the disappointing response to Meta’s financial disclosure indicates that investors are leery about excessive exposure to AI.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/krishna-ahirao-iyer/user_content/ckimages/orig_avgo.webp\" width=\"750\"/></p><p><br/>In the quantitative arena, the baseline performance of AVGO stock since January 2019 indicates a strong upward bias. Notably, AVGO’s 10-week projected returns features a bullishly skewed distributional curve, with median price outcomes ranging from $370 to a little over $430. Price clustering is expected to be predominant at around $408.</p><p>Currently, though, AVGO stock is structured in a 6-4-U formation: six up weeks, four down weeks, with an overall upward slope. Under this condition, the range of outcomes is about the same as the baseline state. However, price clustering would be expected to occur at around $393.</p><p>That’s still bullish but there’s a 3.68% negative delta in expected price density dynamics relative to baseline. Keep that in mind if you’re considering an acquisition of the red ink.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-investors-are-turning-bearish-on-meta?post=531943\">Why Investors Are Turning Bearish On META</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/what-can-investors-expect-from-archer-aviation-earnings-next-week?post=531528\">What Can Investors Expect From Archer Aviation Earnings Next Week? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/how-nvidias-5-trillion-windfall-could-make-2-quantum-computing-stocks-go-even-more-parabolic?post=531508\">How Nvidia’s $5 Trillion Windfall Could Make 2 Quantum Computing Stocks Go Even More Parabolic</a><br/></div>",

Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this 'good place', the central bank's well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates.</p><p>The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><h3><br/><strong>Highlights from the press conference</strong></h3><p>We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde:</p><p>On the <strong>ECB’s risk assessment</strong>, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB's President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks.</p><p><strong>Supply chain disruptions.</strong> Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general.</p><p><strong>Risks to inflation</strong>. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high.</p><h3><br/><strong>Comfortably staying in its 'good place'</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance.</p><p>At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts.</p><p>On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference.</p><p>In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase.</p><p>More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President's scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/></div>",

He called the move a necessary step to maintain global parity.</p><p>Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday night: “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office.”</p><p>“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years,” Trump said. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” According to Fox News.</p><p> Talk of an oil glut is weighing om the market after Shell’s CEO said he saw an oversupply coming after reporting blow out earnings. Also people are still unsure if President Trump’s tough sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil will actually put a real dent in Russia’s oil exports. The market seems way more worried about a possible slowdown in global demand and the idea that we might be heading for an oil glut. But honestly, we’re just not seeing that reflected in the U.S. oil inventory reports.</p><p>For example, the latest numbers from the EIA show that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (not counting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) dropped by 6.9 million barrels from the previous week. Right now, we’re sitting at 416 million barrels, which is about 6% lower than the five-year average for this time of year. Gasoline inventories also fell—down 5.9 million barrels—and are 3% below the five-year average. Both finished gasoline and the stuff used to blend it saw declines. Distillate fuel inventories  that would most acutely be impacted of reduced Russian petroleum exports went down by 3.4 million barrels and are 8% under the five-year average.</p><p>On the flip side, propane and propylene inventories actually rose by 2.5 million barrels and are 14% above the usual levels for this time of year. Altogether, total commercial petroleum inventories dropped by a hefty 15.9 million barrels last week. Sure, sounds like an glut to me.</p><p>Demand also is at the highest level is years as the EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report showed that total product demand based on product supplied was approximately 20.3 million barrels per day (b/d) down marginally from late-summer highs but up year-over-year by about 1.5% due to higher distillate demand (e.g., diesel and heating oil). Gasoline demand fell to around 8.8 million b/d as driving season winds down, while distillate demand rose to 4.1 million b/d, reflecting early winter preparations.</p><p>The oil market is awaiting updates on the US-China trade deal, which appears to be progressing. President Trump has eased some sanctions on Russia while his administration negotiates agreements with South Korea.</p><p>This morning’s big story centers on the Trump administration’s ongoing push for “energy dominance,” which basically means ramping up U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), crude oil, and other fuels to major Asian allies. This strategy goes hand-in-hand with broader trade talks, like President Trump’s recent summit with China’s Xi Jinping and the steady connections with South Korea. For instance, Wright pointed out that the U.S. is in a strong position to boost natural gas and oil exports to South Korea, and he’s planning a trip to Asia soon to hammer out the final details. This follows the August 2025 summit between Trump and South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung, where both sides agreed to a massive $100 billion energy deal over four years.</p><p>Looking at the specifics, South Korea’s Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) has already locked in long-term contracts for 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG every year starting in 2028, mainly from places like Cheniere Energy’s Texas facilities.</p><p>Wright says this is a smart move for South Korea, helping them cut back on reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, especially with all the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. On the crude oil front, South Korea remains the top Asian buyer of U.S. crude, importing an impressive 84 million barrels in the first half of 2025 alone, worth about $6.4 billion.</p><p>The agreement also includes LPG, coal, and naphtha, and it’s expected that crude and LPG will make up around two-thirds of that $100 billion goal. Wright notes that U.S. light sweet grades like WTI Midland are especially appealing due to competitive pricing, such as the $2.10 per barrel spread compared to the UAE’s Murban benchmark as of late August.</p><p>On a bigger scale, there are ongoing discussions for a joint U.S.-South Korea venture on the Alaska LNG project, similar to what the U.S. is working on with Japan. Wright estimates that U.S. LNG exports could double in the next five years—reaching about 20 billion cubic feet per day—and possibly double again if Asian demand keeps climbing, fueled by the growth in AI data centers and manufacturing.</p><p>There’s also a new U.S.-South Korea trade agreement that includes those annual LNG purchases and $3 billion in investments over five years. Wright says this not only boosts South Korea’s energy security, since it imports all of its refinery feedstock, but also benefits American producers in Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska.</p><p>Switching gears to China, Wright mentioned that the U.S. is ready to step in if China starts buying less energy from Russia—a possibility given today’s announcement of a potential major U.S.-China energy deal focused on Alaskan oil and gas.</p><p>After Thursday’s Trump-Xi meeting, both countries agreed to explore a significant deal for Alaskan resources, and Wright, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, plans to meet with Chinese officials soon to hash out the details. Trump himself posted about this on Truth Social, rating the meeting a “12 out of 10” and highlighting lowered tariffs as part of the package.</p><p>China has been a major buyer of discounted Russian oil and gas since the Ukraine invasion, but U.S. sanctions—like those targeting Russian oil shipping and financial networks—are starting to squeeze those volumes. Wright had previously said in September that Russian gas sales to China wouldn’t hurt U.S. exporters, but now his comments suggest that if sanctions or politics push China to buy less from Russia, the U.S. could easily fill the gap. You can also get my daily trade levels by reaching out to me directly.</p><p>Speaking of filling the gap that’s exactly what natural gas futures did this morning and we could be very close to a seasonal bottom and natural gas what we would recommend is start looking and putting on those winter strategies right now as we believe that a colder than normal center which is being predicted by the fox weather channel could lead to a surprising rallying as we have said before the market has become complacent because we haven’t had a below average winter since 2018 if we indeed flipped the script this winter we could see natural gas make significant advances especially with the increasing US export picture as well as increasing domestic demand.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trying-to-get-that-feeling-again-the-energy-report?post=530032\">Trying To Get That Feeling Again - The Energy Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/hey-dude-wheres-my-surplus-the-energy-report?post=529808\">Hey Dude Where’s, My Surplus?

This followed a similar cut in September and was in line with expectations. The Fed cited the recent softening of the labor market, but after completely missing the 2020 inflation run up, some members remain cautious about current inflation rates (which remain near multiyear lows). One governor was in favor of a 50 bps cut, while another preferred no cut. The chart shows that credit spreads have lightened in recent months, but both long and intermediate-term treasury yields are leaning towards another cut in December.</p><p><br/><strong>South American Weather Pattern Update</strong></p><p>South American Climate Pattern Favorable into Mid-Nov; Soybean Seeding In Parana Normal:</p><p>The South American is void of threats into mid-Nov as heavier shower actively expands northward into Mato Grosso, Goias and fringe – but expanding – soy producing areas of north and northeast Brazil. Soaking totals of 2+” have fallen across the eastern half of Argentina and the southern third of Brazil. It remains that all of South America will be well watered on November 5<sup>th</sup>. Showers linger in southern Brazil for another 24-36 hours. Daily shower impact the northern half of Brazil’s ag Belt beginning Oct 31<sup>st</sup>, with 10-day accumulation in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias pegged at 1.50-4.50”. This is a typical Brazilian climate pattern. Also of note is that the principal forecasting models indicate moderate to heavy rain returns to central and northern Argentina Nov 2-5<sup>th</sup>. There is no evidence of extreme heat through mid-November. An early start to the growing season is favorable.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Market Searches for Guidance; Brazilian Prices Stagnate:</strong></p><p>Brazil’s cash corn market is stuck. Expanding corn-based ethanol production &amp; consumption provides a pillar of support, while the sheer size of production in 2025 keeps in place monthly exports of 6.5 MMT’s. Brazil’s corn ship lineup as of late October feature cumulative vessels worth 5.30 MMT’s, vs. 4.5 a year ago, and seasonal decline in weekly loadings has been less intense than last year. There’s enough for supply to meet ethanol and export demand. Note that Brazil’s daily cash corn price seasonal strength has been largely absent since August, and with interior prices in Mato Frosso still quoted below $3.80/Bu, vs. $3.95 a year ago in late Oct, ARC doubts any kind of rationing rally unfolds in Brazil through the balance of 2025. It’s the lack of movement in global cash corn markets that’s kept CBOT rallies challenged.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Comments &amp; Analysis</strong></p><p>Corn &amp; Ag Markets Await Details of Trump-Xi Visit; Rally Encourages Producer Selling Globally:</p><p>CBOT corn ended mixed, with calendar spreads narrowing. Price discovery over the next 24 hours will be centered on whatever details become available from Presidents Trump &amp; Xi talks overnight. Although, news of success that China would resume buying US ag products and loaded 3 US soybean cargoes just before the talks, the grain complex reaction to the successful news have been rather muted. The market must want more encouraging details as many traders priced in a positive outcome. Headline volatility persists through the balance of the week, and many analysts maintain that the fundamental spark to propel March CBOT above $4.50-$4.52 is absent today. The Midwest cash ethanol market has done little in October, and ethanol inventories will be building seasonally from now till April. A peak in ethanol grind occurs in November. Otherwise, weakness in South American &amp; Ukrainian FOB premiums indicates producers worldwide are rewarding the rally. The Argentine peso’s inability to sustain rallies keeps farmers there profitable. Most important overnight is the US and China’s ability to lower tariffs on one another. We must reiterate that China is unlikely to import sizable tonnages of corn/feed with their own large domestic supplies. Trade news rallies should be rewarded with the US lacking a demand driver thereafter. Corn should be nearing a seasonal peak without adverse South American weather. Dec corn has resistance above $4.36.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/keep-the-trade-deal-momentum-going-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531431\">Keep The Trade Deal Momentum Going - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/corn-fundamentals-remain-a-major-obstacle-for-bulls-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531123\">Corn Fundamentals Remain A Major Obstacle For Bulls.

Founded in 1995, it’s now a mature e-commerce platform focusing on categories like collectibles, refurbished goods, and AI tools for users.</p><p>Recently, eBay’s stock sold off despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, revenue hit about $2.82 B (vs. $2.73 B expected) and EPS was $1.36 (vs. $1.33 expected). The drop came after management issued weaker forward guidance, projecting slower GMV growth (4–6% for Q4) and ongoing margin pressures. Investors reacted negatively to signs of deceleration despite solid current results.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"ebayD\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/gregor-horvat/user_content/ckimages/orig_ebayd.webp\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>From an Elliott Wave perspective, eBay appears to be in a strong and extended fifth wave advancing from the April lows, with the impulsive structure still looking incomplete. The recent sell-off following earnings may represent a deeper, higher-degree <strong>ABC correction</strong> within <strong>wave IV</strong>, particularly considering the presence of a newly opened and unfilled price gap.</p><p>The <strong>ideal support zone</strong> lies between <strong>83–77</strong>, where the correction could potentially find a floor before resuming higher. We continue to anticipate a final push to new highs in <strong>wave V</strong>, likely extending <strong>beyond the 100 area</strong>. However, it’s important to note that once a five-wave sequence completes, markets often enter a slower, corrective phase, suggesting we may be approaching the <strong>late stages of the broader bullish cycle (red wave three)</strong> heading into year-end.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"basicbullishimpulse\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/gregor-horvat/user_content/ckimages/orig_ethbtcbasic_638974370953023378.webp\" width=\"401\"/></p><p>The Elliott Wave Principle is a form of technical analysis that identifies patterns in market movements. A bullish impulsive wave is one of the most important and common wave structures in an uptrend. It describes how prices typically move in the direction of the main trend. A bullish impulsive wave consists of five waves labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Basic Impulsive Bullish Pattern shows that eBay can be finishing wave 4 correction before a bullish continuation for wave 5.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/asml-is-unfolding-a-five-wave-impulse-into-all-time-highs?post=531110\">ASML Is Unfolding A Five-Wave Impulse Into All-Time Highs</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/zcash-remains-under-strong-bullish-pressure?post=530666\">Zcash Remains Under Strong Bullish Pressure </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-wave-4-consolidation-before-the-next-breakout?post=530176\">Netflix Wave 4: Consolidation Before The Next Breakout</a></p></div>",
