At writing, Comcast stock is up nearly 200% versus its April low.</p><h2><br/>What Trump might have against a Comcast-WBD deal</h2><p>Experts aren’t entirely convinced that a potential Comcast-WBD merger will succeed in securing regulatory approval under the Trump administration.</p><p>Why? Because the President’s disdain for the company and its co-chief executive, Brian Roberts, is well-documented.</p><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/trump-slams-msnbc-comcast-ceo-155801595.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump called Roberts a “lowlife”</a> and denounced Comcast as “ a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting” on Truth Social – animosity that analysts suspect could translate into regulatory resistance.  </p><p>Blair Levin of New Street Research, for example, told clients in his latest research note that “it is almost certain that the Trump DOJ would not allow CMCSA to buy WBD and the result would be decided in court.”</p><p>Trump’s criticism appears rooted in his perception that Comcast’s media properties – particularly MSNBC and CNN – are left-leaning or hostile to his administration.</p><h2><br/>Does it mean CMCSA wouldn’t bid for WBD?</h2><p>Not necessarily. Comcast executives reportedly believe the aforementioned regulatory risks are actually overstated or premature.</p><p>In fact, according to anonymous sources, the company is weighing its options. One potential workaround could involve excluding CNN from the deal or divesting it post-acquisition.</p><p>Comcast’s donation to Trump’s $300 million White House ballroom initiative via the Trust for the National Mall may also be a strategic gesture to build goodwill.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq-listed firm is already spinning off MSNBC into Versant – a move that may further help mitigate concerns.</p><p>Given the strategic value of WBD assets, Comcast’s leadership may also bet that President Trump’s reputation as a dealmaker will ultimately override his public grievances.</p><h2><br/>Is Comcast stock worth buying without WBD?</h2><p>Investors should note, however, that Comcast shares remain worth owning heading into 2026 – even without WBD – given the company’s fundamentals remain compelling.</p><p>On Thursday, the mass media and entertainment conglomerate reported market-beating financials for its third quarter, with a 45% year-on-year increase in free cash flow to $4.9 billion.</p><p>CMCSA stock is currently going for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 7 which makes it all the more attractive for long-term investors.</p><p>A lucrative <a href=\"https://invezz.com/stocks/best/top-dividend-stocks/\">dividend</a> yield of 4.87% makes up for another great reason to invest in Comcast today.</p><p>Wall Street also currently has a consensus “overweight” rating on CMCSA with a mean target of about $39, indicating potential upside of nearly 50% from here.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/msft-meta-stock-sink-on-ai-spending-plans-analyst-view-only-one-as-buy?post=531979\">MSFT, META Stock Sink On AI Spending Plans: Analyst View Only One As Buy </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/snap-ceo-downplays-metas-smart-glasses-our-ar-glasses-will-be-infinitely-more-capable?post=531650\">Snap CEO Downplays Meta’s Smart Glasses: ‘Our AR Glasses Will Be Infinitely More Capable’ </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-vs-microsoft-stock-as-both-hit-40-trillion-market-cap?post=531145\">Apple Vs Microsoft Stock As Both Hit $4.0 Trillion Market Cap </a></p></div>",

The year-over-year growth rate in the CPI has now increased for six months in a row.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20sept%2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This suggests there is significant upward pressure on prices. </p><p>This is echoed by the so-called “core” CPI which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core CPI was up in September, month over month, by 0.22 percent. Core CPI growth has not gone down, month over month, in 64 months.</p><p>Measured year-over year, September’s core CPI was up by 3.0 percent, and has been above three percent for three months. Indeed, core CPI year-over-year inflation has only dipped below 2 percent during three months of the past 53 months. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/cpi%20core%20sept.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Although the Federal Reserve claims to have a target CPI inflation rate of 2 percent, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Fed isn’t actually trying very hard to hit the target rate. </p><p>After all, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditure measure, also shows that price inflation hasn’t fallen to two percent or below two percent since February of 2021.  The August PCE measure (the most recent available number) was up 2.7 percent, year over year, while the core PCE increase for August was 2.9 percent. </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://cdn.mises.org/inline-images/PCE.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>The Fed, of course, has had to provide excuses for why it is so bad at getting price inflation back down to its target. After all, aren’t we told that the Fed is filled with the world’s best analysts and economists? The explanation given nowadays is that tariffs are pushing prices up, and so it’s really the fault of the administration. This may be a savvy move politically, but it’s bad economics. Price inflation is caused by monetary inflation, and not by tariffs, “Putin’s price hike,” or by logistical problems. The Fed likes to blame price inflation on everything but the real cause, which is monetary inflation—an increasing money supply. Only an increasing money supply can create <em>general </em>price increases in the economy in which prices for rents, food, energy, services, etc rise in aggregate. It is only when the money supply rises that prices generally rise across the whole economy. </p><p>Yet, even by the federal government’s own CPI measure—which tends to downplay the real impact of price inflation—we see overall price increases. Yes, some prices fall here and there in the CPI report, as we now see in used cars and energy. But the index is up overall. This is possible because monetary inflation means that when prices rise in some areas, there is still extra money sloshing around that is available to keep bidding up prices across the board. </p><p>Without a rising money supply, on the other hand, prices could not rise across the economy <em>in general</em> because rising prices in some areas would reduce the money available for spending in other areas. That is, price deflation in some areas would fully offset price inflation in other areas, and we would not see any significant general price inflation.</p><p>If price increases were merely the result of tariffs, we would indeed see price increased in goods that rely on imported parts, or which are imported as finished goods. However, if the money supply were stable, increased spending on imports would lead to<em> less</em> spending—and falling prices— in other areas. </p><p>That’s not happening. Rather, we continue to see significant increases in prices across the economy, in general, so we can’t blame this on tariffs, or oil prices, or any foreign war. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-national-debt-soars-past-38-trillion?post=531166\">The National Debt Soars Past $38 Trillion</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/no-tariffs-did-not-cause-septembers-budget-surplus?post=530804\">No, Tariffs Did Not Cause September’s Budget Surplus</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/the-federal-reserve-cut-rates-so-the-rich-get-richer?post=523742\">The Federal Reserve Cut Rates So The Rich Get Richer </a></p></div>",

General Motors rose to a high of $70.2, up by 70% from its lowest level in April when Donald Trump launched his trade war. This recovery has brought its market capitalization to over $64 billion.</p><h2><br/>Stable revenue growth and pivot from the EV business </h2><p>General Motors stock price has done well after publishing its financial results last week.</p><p>The company, which is the parent company of brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac, is doing well in a difficult market environment.</p><p>Its revenue came in at $48.5 billion in the last quarter, largely flat from what it made in the same period last year. This happened as the company achieved the highest third-quarter market share in the US and returned its Chinese business to profitability.</p><p>Its profitability was affected by the ongoing external issues such as tariffs that Donald Trump implemented on imports. As a result, its net income margin plunged to 2.7% from the previous 6.3%, while the automotive operating cash flow fell to $6 billion.</p><p>The main reason why the GM stock surged is that the company admitted that it will not be the next Tesla. It now expects to fully focus on the ICE business, which is doing well and which it has a leading market share in the US. The CEO <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/static-files/51db67b7-798b-4ae3-9486-1a2228bdfc66\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s clear that ICE volumes will remain higher for longer. We lead the industry today, and we are increasingly well-positioned to meet strong, sustained demand.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>GM, like other traditional companies, were quick to pivot to the electric vehicle industry after witnessing Tesla’s robust growth. It launched EVZ brands of its top vehicles, including the Hammer, Bolt, Buick, and Cadillac. It is <a href=\"https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/29/gm-to-lay-off-over-5500-workers-amid-slowing-ev-demand-and-tax-credits-end/\">now cutting over 5,500 jobs</a> in its EV division.</p><p>While sales were strong initially, the trend faded as concerns about these vehicles remained. Only Cadillac EVs are doing relatively well, but it is unclear whether the growth will continue.</p><p>Play Video -</p><p>GM stock price has jumped because of the latest talks between the US and China, which have yielded some major breakthroughs. For example, the company can now operate without worrying substantially about rare earth materials and magnets.</p><p>Also, the company may benefit from an improved US-China relationship as it still has a large presence there.</p><p>Analysts expect the GM’s revenue will stagnate in the next few years. The average estimate for this year’s revenue is $185.83 billion, down by 0.86% from last year. </p><p>Analysts expect that its revenue will remain at $185.82 billion next year. Its profitability will start improving as it focuses on its most profitable ICE business.</p><h2><br/>GM stock price technical analysis</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"GM stock price\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://invezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GM-stock-1024x584.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-GM/\" target=\"_blank\">GM</a> stock chart | Source: TradingView</p><p>The weekly timeframe chart shows that the GM stock price has done well in the past few months. It has jumped from a low of $25.70 in 2023 to a record high of $70.22. </p><p>GM recently moved above the important resistance level at $64.82, its highest point in January 2022. It also moved above the key resistance level at $60.45, invalidating the forming double-top pattern. </p><p>The stock has remained above the 50-week and 100-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued pointing upwards. </p><p>Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the GM stock price retreats and retests the support at $64.8. Such a move will be bullish as it will be a sign of a break-and-retest pattern, a common continuation sign. </p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/apple-stock-in-the-red-ahead-of-q4-earnings-what-to-expect?post=531977\">Apple Stock In The Red Ahead Of Q4 Earnings: What To Expect? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/forget-nvidia-stock-these-boring-ai-companies-are-leading-the-sp-500-index?post=531542\">Forget Nvidia Stock, These Boring AI Companies Are Leading The S&amp;P 500 Index </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/evening-digest-nvidias-5t-milestone-450b-us-south-korea-deal-14b-shutdown-drag?post=531526\">Evening Digest: Nvidia’s $5T Milestone, $450B U.S.-South Korea Deal, $14b Shutdown Drag </a><br/></div>",

The big reason that some of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsofts-cloud-surge-lifts-revenue-above-expectations-2025-10-29/\" target=\"_blank\">financial press was reporting</a> was that investors were concerned about overspending on capital expenditures, or AI.</p><p>The concern is that<strong> too much spending now could hurt short-term profitability</strong>, particularly in an environment where <strong>AI stocks could be in a bubble and the AI boom could fizzle</strong> due to uncertainty over the true ROI of AI investments.</p><p>While this may be true for many companies, it is <strong>probably not the case with Microsoft, the second largest cloud computing company</strong> behind Amazon. This is one <strong>area where AI spending is critical</strong> to meet the massive AI spending.</p><p>After the <strong>initial knee-jerk selloff</strong>, Microsoft stock started climbing back on what really was an excellent earnings report. As of 10 a.m. ET, Microsoft stock was only down about 2%. Wall Street analysts mostly recognized the strength of the results and tuned out the noise, as many of them raised Microsoft’s price target post-earnings.</p><h2><br/>It really was a good quarter for Microsoft</h2><p>Overall, Microsoft <strong>turned in a strong quarter</strong> in the fiscal first quarter that ended September 30. The Magnificent 7 firm posted strong gains and easily topped analysts’ expectations.</p><ul><li><strong>Revenue</strong>: $77.7B, up 17% year-over-year.

This beat estimates of $3.66 per share.</li></ul><p>“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,” Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said. <strong>“It’s why we continue to increase our investments in AI</strong> across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.”</p><p>The big driver for Microsoft was its cloud business, specifically its Azure cloud computing segment.</p><p>Overall, <strong>Microsoft Cloud generated $49.1 billion in revenue, up 26% year-over-year</strong>. In addition, the remaining performance obligation (RPO), or work under contract in the pipeline, increased 51% to $392 billion.</p><p>Within the overall cloud business, Intelligent Cloud, which is its AI cloud computing business, saw revenue increase by 28%. <strong>Azure, which is its major AI cloud computing platform, saw revenue climb 40% in the quarter</strong>.</p><p>Part of that pipeline is <strong>filled by OpenAI</strong>, which just signed a new contract with Microsoft to <strong>acquire $250 billion in Azure cloud </strong>computing services.</p><p>The concerns over AI spending stemmed from a <strong>record $34.9 billion in capital expenditures last quarter</strong>, which was higher than expected.</p><p>CFO Amy Hood said it was to meet growing demand, and it will be even higher this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year.</p><blockquote><p>With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we’re increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25,” Hood said.</p></blockquote><p><br/>Investors should tune out the short-term noise, as AI spending by one of the leading cloud computing companies with booming growth should not be a long-term concern.

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Gray High Rise Buildings\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/936722/pexels-photo-936722.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/gray-high-rise-buildings-936722/\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></em></p><p><br/>The European Central Bank is moving forward with its digital euro plans, targeting a launch date of 2029. However, key decisions remain pending as lawmakers and officials continue to debate the legal and political groundwork needed to make the project viable across the Eurozone. With concerns about privacy, competition, and dependency on non-European payment systems, the ECB is accelerating its efforts despite ongoing political disagreements.</p><h2><br/>Legal Framework Still Pending as ECB Concludes Preparation Phase</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://x.com/kyledoops/status/1983798556998910168\">European Central Bank (ECB)</a> is expected to conclude its current preparation phase for the digital euro at the end of October 2025. According to sources cited by Bloomberg, officials will meet this week in Florence, Italy, to decide on the next steps.</p><p>Preparatory work for the digital euro started in late 2023, following earlier studies that began in 2020. ECB Board Member Piero Cipollone recently stated that mid-2029 is a likely launch window if legal approval is secured by 2026. Cipollone explained that a digital euro would give Europeans access to a stable digital payment method, especially in times of crisis such as war or cyberattacks.</p><h2><br/>Lawmakers Still Divided on Digital Euro Adoption</h2><p>Despite progress in technical planning, the digital euro still faces political resistance. Legislation has been under review in the <a href=\"https://x.com/coinbureau/status/1983509366515917278\">European</a> Parliament since 2023 but has seen delays, particularly around the 2024 elections.</p><p>Many lawmakers, member states, banks, and consumers have raised concerns about privacy and digital surveillance. The lack of agreement has slowed down formal approval. ECB officials hope lawmakers will finalize the legal framework within the next four years.</p><p>Last month, finance ministers from EU member states agreed on a roadmap for the digital euro, including setting limits on individual holdings. Cipollone called this agreement a “breakthrough,” as it addresses one of the key concerns surrounding the project.</p><h2><br/>Digital Currency Seen as Counter to Foreign Payment Dependence</h2><p>Policymakers are increasingly worried about Europe’s reliance on foreign payment firms such as Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal. The <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/russias-central-bank-allows-banks-to-engage-in-crypto-operations-with-limits/\">ECB’s digital euro</a> aims to reduce this dependency by providing a public digital alternative that is accessible to all EU residents.</p><p>Officials are also watching the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins, which some fear could weaken the Eurozone’s monetary sovereignty. The digital euro is being seen as one way to push back against the growing influence of private and foreign-controlled payment networks.</p><p>Some countries in the Eurozone are also pushing for faster adoption to catch up with global developments. However, without a legal mandate from the European Parliament, the ECB cannot move forward with full-scale implementation.</p><h2><br/>Global CBDC Development Still Limited, But Growing</h2><p>According to the Atlantic Council, only three countries have fully launched central bank digital currencies: Nigeria, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. An additional 49 countries are currently in the pilot phase.</p><p>The Human Rights Foundation also tracks <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/deutsche-bank-predicts-central-banks-may-hold-bitcoin-by-2030/\">CBDC</a> development and notes that digital currencies can improve payment systems and promote financial access. Still, critics warn that these currencies could reduce privacy and increase government oversight of personal finances.</p><p>The United States remains cautious in its approach. The Federal Reserve has not committed to a retail CBDC, citing the need for political backing and legislative approval. Instead, the U.S. has focused on regulating stablecoins, especially since the introduction of the GENIUS Act in July 2025.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/services/visa-expands-crypto-push-with-mysterious-blockchain-integration-plan?post=531522\">Visa Expands Crypto Push With Mysterious Blockchain Integration Plan</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/149m-inflows-into-bitcoin-etfs-amid-price-dip-will-the-trend-hold?post=531176\">$149M Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs Amid Price Dip: Will The Trend Hold?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nvidia-corporation-stock-gains-498-after-unveiling-nvqlink-quantum-supercomputing-platform?post=531153\">Nvidia Corporation Stock: Gains 4.98% After Unveiling NVQLink Quantum Supercomputing Platform</a><br/></div>",

This rebound comes as investors digest the latest earnings reports from domestic and international companies, alongside fresh regional economic data. Additionally, market participants are evaluating the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut and its guidance on future monetary policy. </p><p>Among the standout performers, Standard Chartered rose by 2.2% on the back of a stronger quarterly profit and an upgraded income and return outlook. The bank reported a profit of $1.03 billion attributable to ordinary shareholders, a 10% increase from $931 million in the same period last year. Basic earnings per share also climbed 7.7%, reaching 44.5 US cents compared to 36.8 US cents a year ago. Airtel Africa continued its upward momentum, gaining 3.2% after a strong performance in the previous session. Other companies, including Auto Trader Group, EasyJet, Sainsbury's, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Games Workshop, Tesco, and BP, posted gains ranging from 0.4% to 1%.</p><p>However, not all stocks fared well.WPP suffered a sharp 14% drop after cutting its growth forecasts. The advertising giant reported declining revenue for both Q3 and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, citing weaker performance across all regions and business segments. The company now expects like-for-like revenue growth, excluding pass-through costs, to shrink by 5.5% to 6%, compared to its earlier forecast of a 3% to 5% decline. In Q3, WPP's total group revenue fell to £3.26 billion, an 8.4% year-on-year decrease on a reported basis and a 3.5% drop on a like-for-like basis. The company has adjusted its outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, reflecting ongoing challenges.</p><p>Shell PLC delivered strong Q3 results, reporting $5.3 billion in income attributable to shareholders—up from $3.6 billion in Q2 and $4.3 billion a year earlier. Adjusted earnings reached $5.4 billion, while adjusted EBITDA surged to $14.8 billion.Computacenter maintained its growth trajectory in Q3, driven by robust performance in North America, improvements in the UK, and a return to growth in Germany, solidifying its positive momentum. HALEON reaffirmed its 2025 organic revenue growth target of approximately 3.5%, slightly exceeding analyst expectations despite mixed Q3 results across various regions. Drax Group announced plans to acquire three battery energy storage projects for £157.2 million. The acquisition will add 260MW of storage capacity across Scotland and England, with payments staggered through 2028. Vodafone Group announced its acquisition of Skaylink GmbH, a specialist in cloud and digital transformation, for €175 million in a deal with Waterland-managed funds.

Here's what to watch for:</p><p><br/><strong>EXPECTATIONS: </strong>During the company's last earnings call, Amazon said it saw Q3 revenue of $174B-$179.5B, with consensus at the time of $173.2B. \"This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $15.5B and $20.5B, compared with $17.4B in the third quarter 2024. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded,\" the company added.</p><p>Current consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Amazon's third quarter stand at $1.56 and $177.76B, respectively, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The consensus EPS and revenue forecasts for Amazon's full year 2025 stand at $6.65 and $708.84B, respectively.</p><p><br/><strong>BULLISH ON AMAZON: </strong>Last week, KeyBanc resumed coverage of Amazon.com with an Overweight rating and $300 price target. Advertising is fueling gains in the company's retail business, which provides a path forward for grocery becoming more material over the medium term, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Investors have also become too pessimistic on the Cloud business, and the firm sees potential for improving growth into 2026, KeyCorp added.</p><p><br/><strong>AWS GROWTH RATE: </strong>UBS raised the firm's price target on Amazon.com to $279 from $271, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares ahead of the Q3 earnings report on October 30. The firm expects some \"noise\" in the Q3 reported operating income, and its headline guidance for OI may be below consensus. That said, UBS believes focus will likely be on the reported AWS growth rate, and expectations are at 18% year over year with prospects for potentially greater acceleration shifting into Q4 2025 and 2026.</p><p>Stifel also raised the firm's price target on Buy-rated Amazon.com to $269 from $260 as part of a broader research note previewing Q3 results in e-commerce. The management's commentary in Q2 that average sales prices had not risen materially remained the case in Q3, leaving the firm's estimates unchanged based on perceived stability in consumer spend, and the expansion of Same-Day grocery delivery for Prime members may leave some upside for 2026, the firm tells investors in a research note.</p><p><br/><strong>INCREMENTALLY BULLISH: </strong>Wells Fargo is incrementally bullish on Amazon following g update that Project Rainier is now live and doubling scale by year-end 2025. Estimate Project Rainier now contributes $8.2B vs $6.7B prior to 2026 AWS revenue, incremental 70bps year-over-year growth. Wells reiterates an Overweight rating on Amazon.</p><p><br/><strong>WORKFORCE:</strong> Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said in a memo to employees, \"I want to let you know that we're making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates. There will be communications from leaders to those teams and individuals today, but we also wanted to share the broader context about what's happening and why. Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams - explaining how we want to operate like the world's largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers. Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We're already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you've done. The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs. While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles. We're working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted, including offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and our recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon. For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.\"</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/heres-what-wall-st-experts-are-saying-about-these-media-names-ahead-of-results?post=531544\">Here's What Wall St. Experts Are Saying About These Media Names Ahead Of Results </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/heres-what-wall-st-experts-are-saying-about-meta-ahead-of-earnings?post=531529\">Here's What Wall St. Experts Are Saying About Meta Ahead Of Earnings </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/wall-street-more-bullish-on-alphabet-ahead-of-earnings?post=531429\">Wall Street More Bullish On Alphabet Ahead Of Earnings </a><br/></div>",

Washington agreed to cut tariffs on certain Chinese imports from 57% to 47%, while Beijing committed to resume purchases of US soybeans and to lift restrictions on rare-earth exports to the US. This diplomatic easing has supported the US Dollar (USD) and slightly weighed on Oil prices earlier in the day, before they recovered.</p><p>Meanwhile, US sanctions on Russian producer Rosneft have reignited tensions in Europe. In Germany, the government is considering nationalizing the company’s local subsidiary, which operates a key refinery supplying most of Berlin’s fuel. The US Treasury, however, granted a temporary exemption until April 2026, giving Berlin time to seek a foreign buyer.</p><p>On the monetary front, the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday to a range of 3.75%-4.00% and announced that Quantitative Tightening (QT) will end on December 1. Nonetheless, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a more hawkish tone than expected, saying that another rate cut in December is “far from a foregone conclusion.” His remarks pushed US Treasury yields higher and strengthened the USD, limiting Crude Oil’s upside.</p><p>Finally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) are considering a modest output increase in December, continuing their gradual monthly hikes to regain market share. This <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/forecast\">outlook</a>, combined with the firmer USD, keeps investors cautious and maintains Oil prices close to the $60 mark.</p><h2><br/>WTI Technical Analysis: Faces key test at $60.40 resistance amid fragile rebound</h2><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"WTI price chart\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-screenshot%20(65)-1761841472024-1761841472025.png&amp;w=1536&amp;q=95\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><small>WTI US Oil 4-hour chart. Source: FXStreet</small></em></p><p><br/>WTI finds solid support around $59.50, aligning with the 100-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, currently near $59.37. The subsequent rebound is now attempting to break above a descending resistance line around $60.40 coming from the October 24 peak at $62.38, although a confirmed breakout is still needed before signaling stronger bullish momentum.</p><p>A decisive move above this resistance would likely reinforce the upward bias and pave the way for a test of the psychological $61.00 level. Sustained strength beyond that point could extend the recovery toward $62.00, with the next notable resistance at the October 24 high of $62.38.</p><p>On the downside, a clear break below the $59.50 support and the 100-period SMA at $59.37 would invalidate the current rebound and expose WTI to renewed downside pressure. In such a case, the next key support is seen near the October 20 low at $55.97.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/gold-steadies-as-fed-caution-tempers-rate-cut-hopes-trump-xi-truce-lifts-sentiment?post=531896\">Gold Steadies As Fed Caution Tempers Rate-Cut Hopes, Trump-Xi Truce Lifts Sentiment </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/japanese-yen-remains-on-the-back-foot-as-traders-await-boj-governor-uedas-comments?post=531676\">Japanese Yen Remains On The Back Foot As Traders Await BoJ Governor Ueda's Comments </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/amazon-q3-2025-earnings-preview-three-scenarios-that-could-shape-amzns-next-big-move?post=531518\">Amazon Q3 2025 Earnings Preview: Three Scenarios That Could Shape AMZN’s Next Big Move </a><br/></div>",

Microsoft saw big gains in its Azure and AI segment as it ironed out a new deal with OpenAI that has been a cause of concern among the two giants.</p><h3><br/><strong>Microsoft’s Financials</strong></h3><p>Microsoft’s first quarter revenues grew 18% to $77.67 billion, beating analyst estimates of $75.33 billion. EPS of $4.13 also exceeded analyst estimates of $3.67 per share.</p><p>Its Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, saw revenues grow 28% to $30.9 billion, ahead of the market’s estimate of $30.25 billion. Azure reported a growth of 38% during the quarter. Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered revenues of $33 billion compared with the estimate of $32.33 billion. The More Personal Computing unit saw revenues grow 4% to $13.8 billion, ahead of the $12.83 billion consensus.</p><p>Microsoft did not provide estimates. The market expects revenues of $79.73 billion and an EPS of $3.78 for the second quarter. For the current fiscal year, revenues are expected to be $321.25 billion with an EPS of $15.40.</p><h3><br/><strong>Microsoft’s OpenAI Partnership</strong></h3><p>During the year, Microsoft and OpenAI have had<a href=\"https://www.sramanamitra.com/2025/07/31/microsoft-and-openai-deal-with-partnership-issues/\"> partnership issues</a>, and some of those are likely to be resolved in the coming year. Earlier this week, OpenAI announced a restructuring that converted it to a for-profit business from an earlier nonprofit standing. OpenAI’s for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC. Under the new structure, Microsoft, which had invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, now holds 27% of the company valued at $135 billion.</p><p>Despite the change in structure, OpenAI will remain Microsoft’s frontier model partner and Microsoft will continue to have exclusive IP rights and Azure API exclusivity until Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). One of the key points of contention in the deal has been the trigger when OpenAI achieves AGI status. As per the new rules, once AGI is declared by OpenAI, the declaration will be verified by an independent expert panel.</p><p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft’s IP rights</a> for both models and products are extended through 2032 and now include models post-AGI. Microsoft’s IP rights to research will remain until either the expert panel verifies AGI or through 2030. Microsoft can also now independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with other third parties. In exchange, OpenAI has contracted to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, but Microsoft will no longer have a right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s compute provider. The deal now keeps the two firms working together until 2032 at least. Prior to the deal, OpenAI was constrained in its ability to raise funds from outside investors and secure computing contracts. The requirement that OpenAI rely exclusively on Microsoft for computational resources was one of the big areas of concern for OpenAI.</p><p>Besides its OpenAI partnership, Microsoft remains committed to AI investment. For the three months ended September, Microsoft reported spending nearly $35 billion on new projects especially data centers. Currently, the demand for Microsoft’s cloud computing services far exceeds its available data centers, hence the rush for expansion.</p><h3><br/><strong>My Take</strong></h3><p>Microsoft and OpenAI have concluded a deal until 2032. This tells me their AGI timeline is 3-8 years. Good to know. Governments better get UBI figured out in that timeframe or social unrest will destabilize society completely.</p><p>On the upside, medical and scientific research should explode and accelerate the cure for all diseases scenario. Personalized tutoring, mentoring, education and healthcare should also scale rapidly.</p><p>Its stock is currently trading at $541.55 with a market capitalization of $4.03 trillion. It hit a 52-week high of $555.45 yesterday after results. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $344.79 that it had fallen to in April this year.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-socks-analysis-of-ibms-cognitus-acquisition?post=530304\">Cloud Socks: Analysis Of IBM’s Cognitus Acquisition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-continues-to-monetize-beyond-streaming?post=529815\">Netflix Continues To Monetize Beyond Streaming </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/cloud-stocks-asml-rides-high-on-ai-boom?post=529128\">Cloud Stocks: ASML Rides High On AI Boom</a><br/></div>",

Indeed, Tuesday had the worst breadth for an up day of any day since 1990! What that means is that the strength in the mega caps outweighed weakness across the rest of the S&amp;P.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1790.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>This weak market breadth places extra weight on the earnings reports of the Magnificent 7. In focus today is META which is currently down almost 9% in the premarket after guiding to a huge increase in expenses in 2026.</p><p>2025 expenses are forecast to come in between $116-$118 billion, representing a 22%-24% increase from 2024. And here’s what META said about 2026:</p><blockquote><p>We anticipate total expenses will grow at a <strong><em>significantly faster percentage rate</em></strong> in 2026 than 2025, with growth driven primarily by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, and add technical talent in priority areas</p></blockquote><p><br/>Let’s do some hypothetical calculations. If 2025 total expenses come in at $117 billion that would represent a 23% increase over total expenses of $95 billion in 2024. And 2026 total expenses will grow at a “significantly faster percentage rate” than the 23% in 2025. Let’s say that means 33% which would work out to $155 billion. Obviously that kind of increase in expenses is going to crush META’s margins and profitability. I’m all for investing for the long term but clearly these numbers are making Wall Street nervous.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.topgunfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sc-2025-10-30T050908.866-1024x609.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p><br/>Last, I’ve been waiting to comment on the mini crash in gold and the gold miners. Personally, I used it as a buying opportunity for a couple of reasons. One, the <a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GDX\">GDX</a> seems to be finding support at its 50 DMA which makes this look like a standard correction in an ongoing bull market.</p><p>Two, fundamentally the miners are essentially printing money with gold around $4000/oz. In its 3Q25 earnings report last week, Newmont (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NEM\">NEM</a>) reported an almost $2000 per ounce margin between its average realized gold price ($3539) and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. ($1566). As a result, Adjusted EBITDA increased 68% from 3Q24 to $3.3 billion. If they can maintain this, they’re looking at about $14 billion in Adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis with an $87 billion market cap or a 6x multiple.</p><p>The same thing applies to Agnico Eagle (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AEM\">AEM</a>) which reported 3Q25 earnings Wednesday afternoon. AEM’s average realized gold price was $3476 and its All In Sustaining Cost/Oz. $1373. That resulted in a 67% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $2.1 billion. Once again, with a market cap of $79 billion, the valuation here remains very attractive.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-hold-onto-cat-despite-it-being-technically-overextended-and-fundamentally-overvalued?post=531493\">Why Hold Onto CAT Despite It Being Technically Overextended And Fundamentally Overvalued</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/bulls-back-in-charge-unh-continue-to-ride-with-uncle-warren-pypl-breakout-or-fakeout?post=531143\">Bulls Back In Charge, UNH: Continue To Ride With Uncle Warren, PYPL: Breakout Or Fakeout?</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/bonds/the-state-of-the-market-the-debate-over-interest-rates-gold-crash?post=529964\">The State Of The Market; The Debate Over Interest Rates; Gold Crash </a><br/></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"The AI Arms Dealer: Nvidia’s Path to $5 Trillion and Beyond\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://tokenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/93291902_m-646x360.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Image courtesy of <a href=\"http://123rf.com/\">123rf.com</a></em></p><p><br/>In late 2024, we posited that AI is not a bubble—centered on Nvidia (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>)—given the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/nvidia-and-the-ai-bubble-is-it-real/\">concerted effort</a> to make AI happen. Namely, through unprecedented public-private partnerships (PPPs). Subsequent capital flows into energy and data centers have only strengthened that thesis.<br/><br/>For investors, this consolidation of influence and infrastructure flows directly through Nvidia, serving as the de facto arms dealer of the AI era, underpinning every AI model and data center needed to drive this transformation.<br/><br/>Now that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company on Wednesday, let’s examine if there is room for even more growth, or if this is an imminent prelude to bubble-popping.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Real Logic Behind AI Investing</strong></h3><p>Beyond AI’s commercial applications for content generation and productivity boosts, AI represents the holy grail of governance. Human-centric governance tends to be inconsistent, reactive, noisy, and to have a high overhead. In contrast, AI-centric governance has the potential to integrate vast data streams from economics, social behavior, and infrastructure in real time.</p><p>This comes hand in hand with policy simulation outcomes and continuous improvement enabled by machine learning. Most importantly, AI gives tiny groups multiplicative power, allowing them to exert their will on a scale otherwise impossible. This process is already underway, with <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/palantir-pltr-the-emerging-digital-nervous-system-of-u-s-government/\">tight coordination among OpenAI, Palantir, and Larry Ellison’s Oracle.</a></p><p>Such is the public-private level coordination revolving AI that Harvard economist Jason Furman <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284\" target=\"_blank\">calculated </a>that cutting the AI-related investments would’ve resulted in an annualized GDP growth of only 0.1% for the first half of 2025.</p><p>According to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI), corporate AI investments reached $252.3 billion in 2024, more than 8x the $31.2 billion in 2022, when the AI hype began. Yet, September’s Gartner research points to $1.5 trillion in worldwide AI spending in 2025, putting the last year to shame.</p><h3><br/><strong>Is Circular Financing a Concern?</strong></h3><p>Although the “AI is not a bubble” thesis has played out as expected so far, there is still a concern of overplaying the narrative itself. In other words, mistaking coordinated industrial policy for organic market demand, where rising valuations justify escalating capital commitments in a self-reinforcing loop.</p><p>This concern became more pressing when Nvidia pledged up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data centers on September 22nd. Nvidia’s rival, AMD, soon joined the OpenAI partnership with a $34 billion pledge on October 6th, contributing its MI300X and MI350X chip series.</p><p>Yet, this represents only a tiny portion of overall circular financing between Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, OpenAI, Coreweave, and data center leasing.</p><p>Wall Street analysts are already likening this circular capital flow to the dot-com bubble building up in the late 1990s, which burst in March 2020. In the most recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, the co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, noted that:</p><blockquote><p>“Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>However, just as investing in the internet turned out to be justified, the same is the case for AI commitments, according to Gates:</p><blockquote><p>“But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they’ll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.”</p></blockquote><p><br/>Nonetheless, despite the circular financing—an artifact of coordination to bring AI to fruition—Nvidia still has room for improvement.</p><h3><br/><strong>The Nvidia GPU and Energy Bottlenecks</strong></h3><p>On Tuesday, Amazon (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) announced it would cut around 14,000 middle managers, representing 4% of its workforce, potentially expanding to 30,000. Long-term, through 2033, Amazon plans to automate 500,000 jobs. As we explored recently, this boosts the company’s bottom line despite the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/why-the-aws-outage-was-good-for-amazons-stock-price/\">recent AWS-related outage</a>.</p><p>At a glance, Amazon’s layoffs fit into the AI narrative, but investors should not mistake them as mono-causal. Throughout 2024, Amazon reported a severe AI GPU shortage in its retail division, to the point that the company launched ‘Project Greenland’ to optimize the allocation of compute resources.</p><p>In Q2 2025, Amazon committed $31.4 billion to AI capital expenditures (capex). For shareholders, this is a bitter, margin-preserving pill to swallow, which has to be offset by cost-cutting—layoffs. In other words, this is likely the primary driver for Amazon’s layoffs, not the AI replacement of human work per se.</p><p>And the willingness to do layoffs points to an ongoing Nvidia GPU shortage across the Big Tech cluster. After all, if Amazon has this problem, the entire Big Tech cluster likely does as well. In turn, Nvidia is expected to continue seeing GPU sales surge.</p><p>Contributing to the $5 trillion market cap milestone, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hinted as much on Tuesday at the GTC conference, when he said he expects half a trillion dollars worth of AI GPU sales. This estimate combines the existing cutting-edge Blackwell chips and the 2026 launch of Rubin chips.</p><p>Previously at July’s CDNLive conference, Jensen also noted that “power generation is going to be a big deal” as existing “power grids aren’t going to be enough to sustain the growth of this industry.”</p><p>This fits into our bullish thesis on <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/nuclear-meets-ai-which-companies-will-reflect-gains-first/\">nuclear power stocks</a>, but it also points to an energy bottleneck. The implication for Nvidia shareholders is that the company’s next challenge is not outcompeting AMD or Intel on performance per watt, but ensuring its customers can obtain those watts in the first place.</p><p>At the same time, as every incremental data center expansion runs up against the physical limits of grid capacity, Nvidia’s bottom line is supported by future scarcity.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/roblox-stock-drops-as-q4-and-full-year-loss-forecasts-disappoint-investors?post=531972\">Roblox Stock Drops As Q4 And Full-Year Loss Forecasts Disappoint Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/eli-lilly-delivers-strong-q3-performance-raises-earnings-outlook?post=531895\">Eli Lilly Delivers Strong Q3 Performance, Raises Earnings Outlook</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

Specifically, the one print that appeared to weigh the heaviest on the tech-centric Nasdaq was <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/META\">META</a>), which beat consensus revenue targets but fell short on earnings per share. The culprit? A one-time, tax-related charge, along with increased capital expenditures for this year and next due to artificial-intelligence-related investments.</p><p>META fell sharply during yesterday’s after-hours session, and the decline extended to the current session.</p><p>Obviously, AVGO stock represents an entirely different entity than META. However, the two share the same AI-related catalyst, which, in the case of Broadcom, has led to a robust return of over 61% year-to-date, inclusive of today’s volatility. Over the past 52 weeks, AVGO has gained nearly 112%, a beneficiary of the surge in AI-related spending.</p><p>During the midweek session, the security appeared to enjoy residual tailwinds from a partnership involving the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/NVDA\">NVDA</a>), and <strong>Oracle</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/ORCL\">ORCL</a>). Under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-partnership-nvidia-and-oracle-build-largest-doe-ai\">landmark deal</a>, the partnership will deliver the DOE’s largest AI supercomputer and accelerate scientific discovery.</p><p>While Broadcom wasn’t mentioned in the press release, such large-scale catalysts may reasonably extend to other major AI players, thereby lifting AVGO stock. However, the disappointing response to Meta’s financial disclosure indicates that investors are leery about excessive exposure to AI.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://talkmarkets.com/contributor/krishna-ahirao-iyer/user_content/ckimages/orig_avgo.webp\" width=\"750\"/></p><p><br/>In the quantitative arena, the baseline performance of AVGO stock since January 2019 indicates a strong upward bias. Notably, AVGO’s 10-week projected returns features a bullishly skewed distributional curve, with median price outcomes ranging from $370 to a little over $430. Price clustering is expected to be predominant at around $408.</p><p>Currently, though, AVGO stock is structured in a 6-4-U formation: six up weeks, four down weeks, with an overall upward slope. Under this condition, the range of outcomes is about the same as the baseline state. However, price clustering would be expected to occur at around $393.</p><p>That’s still bullish but there’s a 3.68% negative delta in expected price density dynamics relative to baseline. Keep that in mind if you’re considering an acquisition of the red ink.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/why-investors-are-turning-bearish-on-meta?post=531943\">Why Investors Are Turning Bearish On META</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/what-can-investors-expect-from-archer-aviation-earnings-next-week?post=531528\">What Can Investors Expect From Archer Aviation Earnings Next Week? </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/how-nvidias-5-trillion-windfall-could-make-2-quantum-computing-stocks-go-even-more-parabolic?post=531508\">How Nvidia’s $5 Trillion Windfall Could Make 2 Quantum Computing Stocks Go Even More Parabolic</a><br/></div>",

Florence, where the ECB met today for its only annual meeting outside of Frankfurt, is apparently also this 'good place', the central bank's well-known pseudonym for comfortably keeping interest rates on hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde even called it a ‘magnificent’ place – Florence, that is, not rates.</p><p>The comments at the press conference confirmed once again that the ECB has no intention to leave its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><h3><br/><strong>Highlights from the press conference</strong></h3><p>We had feared a rather uneventful press conference. What should we say? We hate to be right… Anyhow, here are a few interesting remarks made by Lagarde:</p><p>On the <strong>ECB’s risk assessment</strong>, the introductory statement had the most remarkable change compared with September. Last month, the ECB had still talked about risks to the growth outlook that had become “more balanced”; today, it refrained from qualifying any balance of risk. Instead, the central bank had a somewhat more extensive list of upside and downside risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde even said that some of the downside risks had abated. When asked whether this was a sign of an upcoming shift in the balance of risk, the ECB's President pointed out that it had already narrowed the risks at the September meeting. Funnily enough, back at the September meeting, there had been no mention of a narrowing of risks.</p><p><strong>Supply chain disruptions.</strong> Lagarde referred to a discussion on potential supply chain bottlenecks that could still arise as a result of the latest tensions between China and the EU on microchips and rare earths in general.</p><p><strong>Risks to inflation</strong>. As in the past, the ECB didn’t provide an assessment of the balance of risks to inflation. However, during the press conference, Lagarde mentioned different positions, views and analyses regarding inflation within the Governing Council. These differing views do exist, despite a unanimous decision to keep rates on hold today. A particular concern remains service inflation, which the ECB has often labelled as being too high.</p><h3><br/><strong>Comfortably staying in its 'good place'</strong></h3><p>Looking ahead, today’s meeting has done nothing to change the view that the bar for yet another rate cut from the ECB is high. In fact, the Bank currently feels very comfortable in its ‘good place’. With the ECB’s own growth forecasts indicating that the eurozone economy will grow by slightly more than 1% each year and inflation will settle down to 2% over the next few years, there is indeed very little reason to change its monetary policy stance.</p><p>At the same time, there are still valid dovish arguments that could force the central bank to cut again at the December meeting. Just think of the delayed adverse impact of US tariffs, the stronger euro exchange rate, French politics or a delay in Germany’s fiscal stimulus. If any of these downside risks materialise, we can expect the ECB to engage in one or two more rate cuts.</p><p>On this point, it remains important to note that the current ECB inflation forecast for 2027 includes a 0.2ppt impact from the introduction of the ETS2 system. Needless to say, any delay in the implementation could have implications for the ECB as it would increase the risk of inflation undershooting. Even if Lagarde tried to downplay this issue during the press conference.</p><p>In any case, even if the ECB seems to rest more comfortably on its laurels than before, the December staff projections will be crucial and could still invade its good place. If the 2028 inflation forecasts come in sub-1.7%, the likelihood of yet another rate cut would increase.</p><p>More generally speaking, Lagarde didn’t give away any hints at what’s next for the ECB. Maybe the strongest message came from the colours of the President's scarf, which – at least to us – resembled the French flag. For the rest, today’s meeting was another illustration that the ECB has no intention whatsoever of leaving its ‘good place’ any time soon.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/german-october-inflation-marks-start-of-more-disinflation-to-come?post=531970\">German October Inflation Marks Start Of More Disinflation To Come </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/></div>",

He called the move a necessary step to maintain global parity.</p><p>Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday night: “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office.”</p><p>“Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years,” Trump said. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” According to Fox News.</p><p> Talk of an oil glut is weighing om the market after Shell’s CEO said he saw an oversupply coming after reporting blow out earnings. Also people are still unsure if President Trump’s tough sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil will actually put a real dent in Russia’s oil exports. The market seems way more worried about a possible slowdown in global demand and the idea that we might be heading for an oil glut. But honestly, we’re just not seeing that reflected in the U.S. oil inventory reports.</p><p>For example, the latest numbers from the EIA show that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (not counting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) dropped by 6.9 million barrels from the previous week. Right now, we’re sitting at 416 million barrels, which is about 6% lower than the five-year average for this time of year. Gasoline inventories also fell—down 5.9 million barrels—and are 3% below the five-year average. Both finished gasoline and the stuff used to blend it saw declines. Distillate fuel inventories  that would most acutely be impacted of reduced Russian petroleum exports went down by 3.4 million barrels and are 8% under the five-year average.</p><p>On the flip side, propane and propylene inventories actually rose by 2.5 million barrels and are 14% above the usual levels for this time of year. Altogether, total commercial petroleum inventories dropped by a hefty 15.9 million barrels last week. Sure, sounds like an glut to me.</p><p>Demand also is at the highest level is years as the EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report showed that total product demand based on product supplied was approximately 20.3 million barrels per day (b/d) down marginally from late-summer highs but up year-over-year by about 1.5% due to higher distillate demand (e.g., diesel and heating oil). Gasoline demand fell to around 8.8 million b/d as driving season winds down, while distillate demand rose to 4.1 million b/d, reflecting early winter preparations.</p><p>The oil market is awaiting updates on the US-China trade deal, which appears to be progressing. President Trump has eased some sanctions on Russia while his administration negotiates agreements with South Korea.</p><p>This morning’s big story centers on the Trump administration’s ongoing push for “energy dominance,” which basically means ramping up U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), crude oil, and other fuels to major Asian allies. This strategy goes hand-in-hand with broader trade talks, like President Trump’s recent summit with China’s Xi Jinping and the steady connections with South Korea. For instance, Wright pointed out that the U.S. is in a strong position to boost natural gas and oil exports to South Korea, and he’s planning a trip to Asia soon to hammer out the final details. This follows the August 2025 summit between Trump and South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung, where both sides agreed to a massive $100 billion energy deal over four years.</p><p>Looking at the specifics, South Korea’s Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) has already locked in long-term contracts for 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG every year starting in 2028, mainly from places like Cheniere Energy’s Texas facilities.</p><p>Wright says this is a smart move for South Korea, helping them cut back on reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, especially with all the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf. On the crude oil front, South Korea remains the top Asian buyer of U.S. crude, importing an impressive 84 million barrels in the first half of 2025 alone, worth about $6.4 billion.</p><p>The agreement also includes LPG, coal, and naphtha, and it’s expected that crude and LPG will make up around two-thirds of that $100 billion goal. Wright notes that U.S. light sweet grades like WTI Midland are especially appealing due to competitive pricing, such as the $2.10 per barrel spread compared to the UAE’s Murban benchmark as of late August.</p><p>On a bigger scale, there are ongoing discussions for a joint U.S.-South Korea venture on the Alaska LNG project, similar to what the U.S. is working on with Japan. Wright estimates that U.S. LNG exports could double in the next five years—reaching about 20 billion cubic feet per day—and possibly double again if Asian demand keeps climbing, fueled by the growth in AI data centers and manufacturing.</p><p>There’s also a new U.S.-South Korea trade agreement that includes those annual LNG purchases and $3 billion in investments over five years. Wright says this not only boosts South Korea’s energy security, since it imports all of its refinery feedstock, but also benefits American producers in Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska.</p><p>Switching gears to China, Wright mentioned that the U.S. is ready to step in if China starts buying less energy from Russia—a possibility given today’s announcement of a potential major U.S.-China energy deal focused on Alaskan oil and gas.</p><p>After Thursday’s Trump-Xi meeting, both countries agreed to explore a significant deal for Alaskan resources, and Wright, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, plans to meet with Chinese officials soon to hash out the details. Trump himself posted about this on Truth Social, rating the meeting a “12 out of 10” and highlighting lowered tariffs as part of the package.</p><p>China has been a major buyer of discounted Russian oil and gas since the Ukraine invasion, but U.S. sanctions—like those targeting Russian oil shipping and financial networks—are starting to squeeze those volumes. Wright had previously said in September that Russian gas sales to China wouldn’t hurt U.S. exporters, but now his comments suggest that if sanctions or politics push China to buy less from Russia, the U.S. could easily fill the gap. You can also get my daily trade levels by reaching out to me directly.</p><p>Speaking of filling the gap that’s exactly what natural gas futures did this morning and we could be very close to a seasonal bottom and natural gas what we would recommend is start looking and putting on those winter strategies right now as we believe that a colder than normal center which is being predicted by the fox weather channel could lead to a surprising rallying as we have said before the market has become complacent because we haven’t had a below average winter since 2018 if we indeed flipped the script this winter we could see natural gas make significant advances especially with the increasing US export picture as well as increasing domestic demand.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/trying-to-get-that-feeling-again-the-energy-report?post=530032\">Trying To Get That Feeling Again - The Energy Report </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/hey-dude-wheres-my-surplus-the-energy-report?post=529808\">Hey Dude Where’s, My Surplus?

Soaking totals of 2+” have fallen across the eastern half of Argentina and the southern third of Brazil. It remains that all of South America will be well watered on November 5<sup>th</sup>. Showers linger in southern Brazil for another 24-36 hours. Daily shower impact the northern half of Brazil’s ag Belt beginning Oct 31<sup>st</sup>, with 10-day accumulation in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias pegged at 1.50-4.50”. This is a typical Brazilian climate pattern. Also of note is that the principal forecasting models indicate moderate to heavy rain returns to central and northern Argentina Nov 2-5<sup>th</sup>. There is no evidence of extreme heat through mid-November. An early start to the growing season is favorable.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Market Searches for Guidance; Brazilian Prices Stagnate:</strong></p><p>Brazil’s cash corn market is stuck. Expanding corn-based ethanol production &amp; consumption provides a pillar of support, while the sheer size of production in 2025 keeps in place monthly exports of 6.5 MMT’s. Brazil’s corn ship lineup as of late October feature cumulative vessels worth 5.30 MMT’s, vs. 4.5 a year ago, and seasonal decline in weekly loadings has been less intense than last year. There’s enough for supply to meet ethanol and export demand. Note that Brazil’s daily cash corn price seasonal strength has been largely absent since August, and with interior prices in Mato Frosso still quoted below $3.80/Bu, vs. $3.95 a year ago in late Oct, ARC doubts any kind of rationing rally unfolds in Brazil through the balance of 2025. It’s the lack of movement in global cash corn markets that’s kept CBOT rallies challenged.</p><p><br/><strong>Corn Comments &amp; Analysis</strong></p><p>Corn &amp; Ag Markets Await Details of Trump-Xi Visit; Rally Encourages Producer Selling Globally:</p><p>CBOT corn ended mixed, with calendar spreads narrowing. Price discovery over the next 24 hours will be centered on whatever details become available from Presidents Trump &amp; Xi talks overnight. Although, news of success that China would resume buying US ag products and loaded 3 US soybean cargoes just before the talks, the grain complex reaction to the successful news have been rather muted. The market must want more encouraging details as many traders priced in a positive outcome. Headline volatility persists through the balance of the week, and many analysts maintain that the fundamental spark to propel March CBOT above $4.50-$4.52 is absent today. The Midwest cash ethanol market has done little in October, and ethanol inventories will be building seasonally from now till April. A peak in ethanol grind occurs in November. Otherwise, weakness in South American &amp; Ukrainian FOB premiums indicates producers worldwide are rewarding the rally. The Argentine peso’s inability to sustain rallies keeps farmers there profitable. Most important overnight is the US and China’s ability to lower tariffs on one another. We must reiterate that China is unlikely to import sizable tonnages of corn/feed with their own large domestic supplies. Trade news rallies should be rewarded with the US lacking a demand driver thereafter. Corn should be nearing a seasonal peak without adverse South American weather. Dec corn has resistance above $4.36.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/keep-the-trade-deal-momentum-going-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531431\">Keep The Trade Deal Momentum Going - The Corn &amp; Ethanol Report</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/corn-fundamentals-remain-a-major-obstacle-for-bulls-the-corn--ethanol-report?post=531123\">Corn Fundamentals Remain A Major Obstacle For Bulls.

Founded in 2009 and based in Chicago, the firm focuses on generating income and capital appreciation by investing in one-stop and other senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies with annual EBITDA under $100 million.</p><p>Managed by GC Advisors LLC, Golub emphasizes strong credit quality, scalable business models, and consistent cash flows. With a diversified portfolio across multiple industries, the company has built a reputation as one of the largest and most reliable middle-market lenders in the U.S., generating over $600 million in annual net investment income, maintaining a steady record of dividend payments, and adhering to disciplined risk management.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.35.25-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. reported its fiscal third-quarter 2025 results, ending June 30, with net investment income of $0.38 per share, up from $0.37 in the prior quarter, and adjusted NII steady at $0.39 per share. Revenue rose 27.5% year-over-year to $218.3 million, slightly exceeding expectations. Net earnings were $0.34 per share, while net asset value (NAV) per share declined slightly to $15.00 from $15.04. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, payable on September 29, 2025.</p><p>As of June 30, 2025, Golub’s investment portfolio totaled $8.96 billion across 401 portfolio companies, up from $8.62 billion and 393 companies in the prior quarter. The portfolio was primarily composed of one-stop loans (86.9%), with smaller allocations to equity (7%) and senior secured loans (5.4%). The company made $556.8 million in new investment commitments and repurchased 2.4 million shares of its stock for $34.3 million at an average price of $13.99 per share.</p><p>Golub maintained a strong financial position with $9.24 billion in total assets and $5.15 billion in debt, resulting in a 1.26x debt-to-equity ratio. Liquidity remained healthy, supported by $99.8 million in cash and $547 million in credit facility availability. The company also improved borrowing flexibility by amending its JPMorgan and GC Advisors credit agreements. Despite minor unrealized losses from certain portfolio holdings, Golub demonstrated solid income generation, disciplined capital management, and consistent shareholder value through dividends and buybacks.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.36.43-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><h3><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. has maintained stable net investment income over the years, currently paying an annualized base dividend of $1.56 per share. Its equity investments have occasionally generated additional gains used for special dividends, though these are irregular—$0.04 in FY2023 and $0.35 in FY2024, with none in FY2021 or FY2022.</p><p>The company’s growth prospects are influenced by interest rates and portfolio performance. Investment income yield, which fell to 7.3% in mid-2022, has risen to 12.0% with higher rates, though the net investment spread has narrowed to 5.9% from 7.0% last year due to rising debt costs. Despite this, Golub’s diversified, senior-secured loan portfolio supports stable income and potential capital appreciation.</p><p>Golub’s strategy of combining reliable loan income with opportunistic equity gains, along with disciplined balance sheet management and consistent dividend payments, positions the company to continue generating shareholder value. While future EPS and special dividends are uncertain due to market volatility, the company’s track record suggests it can sustain stable income and selectively reward shareholders.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"527\" src=\"https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-27-at-6.37.17-PM-1024x771.png\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Source: <a href=\"https://golubcapitalbdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Golub-Capital-BDC-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-August-2025.pdf\">Investor Relations</a><br/> </p><h3><strong>Competitive Advantages &amp; Recession Performance</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. has strong competitive advantages in middle-market lending, including a focus on one-stop and senior secured loans, rigorous underwriting, and relationships with private equity sponsors that provide access to high-quality opportunities. Its diversified portfolio and disciplined credit monitoring help manage risk across industries.</p><p>The company has proven resilient in economic downturns, maintaining net investment income and dividend payments even during market stress. By combining conservative lending, active portfolio management, and strategic sponsor partnerships, Golub sustains a stable, recession-resistant business model.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Dividend Analysis</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC’s annual dividend is $1.65 per share. At its recent share price, the stock has a high yield of 11.6%.</p><p>Given the company’s 2025 earnings outlook, NII is expected to be $1.60 per share. As a result, the company is expected to pay out over 100% of its NII to shareholders in dividends.</p><p>The dividend appears to be on track to be cut this year or next.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. is a well-diversified investment company that offers a net investment spread of approximately 5%. We project annualized returns of around 8.5%, primarily driven by its dividend, though actual returns could be higher if its private equity investments perform well.</p><p>Insider ownership exceeds 10% of the $3.94 billion company, indicating strong alignment with shareholder interests. At current prices, the shares merit a hold rating.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/10-of-the-right-retirement-stocks-for-income-investors?post=531175\">10 Of The Right Retirement Stocks For Income Investors</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/3-top-retirement-stocks-for-income?post=531102\">3 Top Retirement Stocks For Income </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/real-estate--reits/high-dividend-50-agnc-investment-corporation?post=530470\">High Dividend 50: AGNC Investment Corporation</a></p></div>",

While the gaming platform delivered mixed results with strong bookings performance and impressive user engagement metrics, shares tumbled over 10% as investors focused on the company’s forecast of wider-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025.</p><p>The stock initially surged more than 8% in <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/how-to-trade-after-hours/\">pre-market trading</a> before reversing course and falling approximately 6-12% as concerns about profitability overshadowed the company’s robust growth in user activity and bookings.</p><h3><br/><strong>Strong User Growth and Bookings Overshadowed by Higher Expenses</strong><br/> </h3><p>Roblox delivered a mixed third-quarter performance that showcased impressive operational growth while raising concerns about profitability. The company reported a net loss of $255.6 million, or $0.37 per share, which was narrower than the consensus estimate of $0.49 per share.</p><p>However, revenue of $1.36 billion, despite climbing 48% year-over-year, fell short of analyst expectations of $1.69 billion. Total expenses surged nearly 38% to $1.66 billion during the quarter, highlighting the significant investments required to fuel the platform’s expansion.</p><p>The standout metric from the quarter was bookings, which jumped 70% year-over-year to $1.92 billion, significantly surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.70 billion. Average daily active users (DAUs) reached 151.5 million, marking a 70% increase and crossing the 150 million milestone for the first time in company history. Hours Engaged grew an impressive 91% year-over-year to 39.6 billion hours, demonstrating the platform’s ability to keep users highly engaged with popular new releases like “Grow A Garden” and “Steal a Brainrot.”</p><p>Despite the strong operational performance, Roblox’s forward guidance dampened investor enthusiasm. For the full year 2025, the company forecasts net losses between $1.10 billion and $1.13 billion, exceeding the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $1.09 billion. The fourth-quarter loss projection of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion also surpassed analyst estimates of $1.34 billion.</p><p>However, the company raised its full-year bookings guidance to $6.566 billion to $6.616 billion, well above the consensus of $6.16 billion, and projected Q4 bookings of $2 billion to $2.05 billion versus estimates of $1.83 billion.</p><h3><br/><strong>Stock Plunges Over 10% Despite Strong Year-to-Date Performance</strong><br/> </h3><p>RBLX stock tumbled 10.46% on Thursday, October 30, 2025, closing at $119.75, down $13.99 from the previous close of $133.74. The stock experienced dramatic intraday volatility, initially jumping more than 8% in pre-market trading before reversing sharply and falling as much as 12% as investors digested the wider-than-expected loss forecasts. Trading volume reached 6.9 million shares, approaching the average daily volume of 7.9 million, as the market reacted to the mixed earnings report and disappointing profitability outlook.</p><p>Despite Thursday’s sharp decline, Roblox stock has delivered exceptional returns over longer timeframes, significantly outperforming broader market indices. Year-to-date, RBLX has surged 101.64% compared to the <a href=\"https://tokenist.com/investing/spx-vs-spy/\">S&amp;P 500’s</a> gain of 16.81%. Over the past year, the stock has soared 170.45% versus the S&amp;P 500’s 18.18% return. The stock reached its 52-week high of $150.59 before Thursday’s selloff, and remains well above its 52-week low of $47.95, reflecting strong investor confidence in the platform’s long-term growth potential despite ongoing profitability challenges.</p><p>Analysts remain moderately optimistic about Roblox’s prospects, with the stock carrying a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy ratings, six Hold ratings, and one Sell rating. The average price target of $149.42 implies approximately 24.8% upside from the current trading level of $119.75, with individual targets ranging from a low of $65 to a high of $180. The company’s market capitalization stands at $81.9 billion, with an enterprise value of $91.71 billion.</p><p>Roblox maintains a strong balance sheet with $2.63 billion in total cash, though its debt-to-equity ratio of 528.68% reflects significant leverage as the company continues investing heavily in platform development and user acquisition.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/eli-lilly-delivers-strong-q3-performance-raises-earnings-outlook?post=531895\">Eli Lilly Delivers Strong Q3 Performance, Raises Earnings Outlook</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/merck--co-beats-expectations-in-q3-2025-lifts-full-year-forecast?post=531815\">Merck &amp; Co.

After several months of increasing headline inflation, the just-released inflation data points to a trend reversal. Headline inflation, according to the national measure, decreased to 2.3% year-on-year in October, from 2.4% YoY in September. The European measure also came down to 2.3% YoY. Core inflation remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY, while services inflation even increased somewhat to 3.5% YoY, from 3.4% YoY.</p><h3><br/><strong>Moving towards 2%</strong><br/> </h3><p>The available regional state data shows that the drop in German inflation was mainly driven by favourable base effects. On the month, almost all categories saw prices slightly increase.</p><p>Looking ahead, the stronger euro and still favourable energy base effects should push German inflation back towards – and below – 2% over the coming months. At the same time, the worsening labour market and AI will further moderate wage growth. Finally, US tariffs could also bring disinflationary pressures to Europe due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US. While these elements clearly bring disinflationary forces to Germany over the coming months, the longer-term picture brings more upward pressure on inflation. Restructuring of supply chains, labour costs in an era of ageing and the green transition remain three important structural drivers of price pressures. And not to forget the inflationary impact from Germany’s fiscal stimulus.</p><p>In short, today’s inflation reading marks another turning point and the start of at least a short-lived period of rather disinflationary pressures before inflationary forces take over again.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/eurozone-gdp-growth-slightly-better-than-expected?post=531891\">Eurozone GDP Growth Slightly Better Than Expected </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/commodities/the-commodities-feed-bullish-eia-release-pushes-oil-higher?post=531681\">The Commodities Feed: Bullish EIA Release Pushes Oil Higher </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/global-markets/rates-spark-fed-and-ecb-in-a-good-place?post=531554\">Rates Spark: Fed And ECB In A Good Place </a><br/></div>",

As investors, our goal is to buy stocks when they are undervalued and sell when they are overvalued. But how do we know what “value” truly means? Let’s dig into the heart of <strong>company stock valuation</strong> and why it matters so much for your long-term financial success.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Understanding Stock Valuation: More Than Just a Number</strong></h3><p>At its core, <strong>stock valuation</strong> is the analytical process of determining the fair value of a company’s shares. This isn’t just about looking at the current market price; it’s about understanding what the business is worth based on its fundamentals, earnings power, growth prospects, assets, and risks.</p><p>There are several approaches to <strong>share valuation</strong>. Some investors prefer the simplicity of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while others dig deeper with discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis or Benjamin Graham’s intrinsic value formula, still a reliable and timeless method for assessing value despite its imperfections. The key is to use these valuation tools to separate the signal from the noise in the ever-volatile world of <strong>stock market valuation</strong>.</p><p>The FAST Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool clearly expresses the relationship between stock prices and fundamental values over the long run. It incorporates all these methodologies to illustrate intrinsic value while providing real-world evidence of the reliability of those valuation models.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Why Valuation in Stocks Matters</strong></h3><p>Imagine walking into a store and seeing two identical products, one priced at $10, the other at $20. Which would you buy? The answer seems obvious, but in the stock market, prices are constantly changing, and the “product” (the company) is evolving as well. <strong>Valuation in stocks</strong> helps you determine whether you’re getting a bargain or overpaying for enthusiasm.</p><p>When you buy a stock without considering its valuation, you’re essentially speculating. But when you anchor your decisions in sound valuation principles, you become a true investor, someone who understands the difference between <em>price</em> and <em>value</em>.<br/> </p><h3><strong>The Market’s Mood Swings: Stock Market Valuation in Action</strong></h3><p>The stock market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term. Prices can swing wildly based on news, sentiment, or macroeconomic factors. However, over time, the market rewards companies that grow earnings and generate value for shareholders. That’s why focusing on <strong>stock market valuation</strong>, not just short-term price movements, is essential for building lasting wealth.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Company Stock Valuation: A Closer Look</strong></h3><p>Let’s break down the main approaches to <strong>company stock valuation</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Relative Valuation</strong> – Compares a company’s valuation ratios (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA) to peers or market averages.</li><li><strong>Absolute Valuation</strong> – Calculates the present value of expected future cash flows (DCF analysis).</li><li><strong>Asset-Based Valuation</strong> – Assesses a company’s assets minus its liabilities to estimate equity value.</li></ol><p>Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, but together they paint a more complete picture of a company’s true worth.<br/> </p><h3><strong><u>How Market Sentiment Impacts Stock Valuations</u></strong><br/> </h3><h3><strong>The Power of Sentiment in Stock Valuation</strong></h3><p>Market sentiment, the collective attitude of investors, plays a powerful role in shaping <strong>stock valuations</strong> in the short run. While valuation methods focus on fundamentals such as earnings, cash flow, and growth, sentiment can temporarily drive prices above or below fair value. However, in the long run, fundamentals always prevail. Recognizing when the market misjudges a stock’s value is the key to minimizing risk and achieving superior long-term returns.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sentiment Drives Prices Beyond Fundamentals</strong></h3><p>When investor sentiment turns optimistic, stocks often trade at higher valuation multiples. This is especially true during bull markets, when enthusiasm and confidence push prices beyond what fundamentals might justify. Conversely, in periods of fear or pessimism, such as market corrections or recessions, valuations can fall sharply, even for fundamentally sound companies.</p><p>For instance, during phases of high investor optimism, <strong>stock market valuations</strong> often reflect excitement more than reality. When sentiment shifts, valuations can quickly contract, revealing how emotional markets can be.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sentiment and Volatility: The Emotional Rollercoaster</strong></h3><p>Market sentiment is highly sensitive and can change overnight. After a stretch of optimism, when valuation multiples expand, the market becomes vulnerable to corrections if sentiment cools. Even small changes, triggered by earnings reports, economic data, or global events, can lead to major swings in <strong>stock market valuation</strong>.</p><p>Interestingly, negative sentiment tends to have a more pronounced and lasting impact on stock prices than positive sentiment. Fear drives prices down faster and further than optimism drives them up.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Behavioral Finance: Why Sentiment Matters</strong></h3><p>Behavioral finance has shown that investor psychology and emotions significantly influence short-term price movements. Retail investors, in particular, can amplify sentiment-driven buying and selling, creating price deviations from intrinsic value. This is why periods of euphoria can lead to bubbles, while fear can present undervalued opportunities for disciplined investors.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Real-World Examples of Sentiment and Valuation</strong></h3><p>Recent examples abound. Companies like Apple and Nvidia have seen their <strong>stock valuations</strong> surge amid investor optimism surrounding innovation and technology trends, sometimes reaching levels that reflect excitement as much as fundamentals.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://fastgraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aapl-1024x536.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><em>(Click on image to enlarge)</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://fastgraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nvda-1024x534.jpg\" width=\"700\"/></p><h3><br/><strong>Conclusion: The Power of Valuation Discipline</strong></h3><p>In the end, <strong>stock valuation</strong> is both an art and a science. It requires a thoughtful blend of quantitative analysis and qualitative insight. By mastering the principles of <strong>company stock valuation</strong> and maintaining a disciplined approach to <strong>share valuation</strong>, investors can navigate the market’s emotional tides with confidence.</p><p>Remember, while market sentiment comes and goes, <em>value endures.</em> As “Mr. Valuation,” I remind investors: focus on what a business is truly worth, not merely what it’s trading for today. That’s the surest path to consistent, long-term investment success.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/how-the-stock-market-works-a-guide-for-long-term-investors?post=530190\">How The Stock Market Works: A Guide For Long-Term Investors </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/discounted-dividend-method-ddm-formula-variations-examples-and-how-to-use-it?post=528485\">Discounted Dividend Method (DDM): Formula, Variations, Examples, And How To Use It </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/factset-evaluating-the-recent-decline-time-to-buy-or-stay-away?post=527447\">FactSet: Evaluating The Recent Decline-Time To Buy Or Stay Away?</a></p></div>",

The move matters now because IBM is sitting close to resistance, analysts remain broadly constructive, and an earnings print has already changed near-term sentiment. Short-term, momentum and news-driven flows are driving price action; long-term, growth and profitability metrics are weighing on valuation comparisons. Globally, the beat reinforces enterprise demand narratives in the US and Europe, while partnerships with AI vendors extend reach into Asia and emerging markets. Compared with recent quarters, IBM’s results show steady revenue execution and stronger market sentiment, lifting technical momentum ahead of the next reporting cycle.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>This note provides a multi-dimensional review of <strong>International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)</strong> based on the latest market, technical and fundamental data. The objective is to explain what is moving the stock now, how recent earnings altered the backdrop, and how IMS metrics, analyst targets and sector comparators knit together into a coherent view for informed investors. The analysis is informational only and avoids forward-looking recommendations.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Key Takeaway: Trade Engine Score</strong></h3><p>IBM’s Trade Engine Score stands at <strong>69.70</strong>. This composite tally blends technicals, fundamentals, sentiment and analyst inputs. A score near 70 indicates a favorable short- to medium-term posture: momentum and sentiment are contributing positively while fundamentals are mixed. In practice, the score suggests greater odds of continued price support from buyers and news flows, but it does not imply guaranteed outperformance. Investors should regard this as a measure of current market reception rather than a standalone valuation signal.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Price Performance, Earnings Watch &amp; Recent Drivers</strong></h3><p>The stock closed at <strong>$308.21</strong>, up <strong>$21.72</strong> month-to-date and <strong>$88.27</strong> year-to-date. IBM is trading within about 3.5% of its 52-week high of <strong>$319.35</strong>, which places it in a near-high trading range where momentum traders and earnings-sensitive funds are most active. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at <strong>74.83</strong> flags short-term overbought conditions; expect volatility around resistance.</p><p>IBM reported earnings on <strong>2025-10-22</strong>. Reported revenue of $16,331,000,000 slightly exceeded the estimate of $16,248,802,078, a modest upside that likely fueled part of the recent price push. The proximity of the print to estimates suggests execution rather than a material reacceleration in top-line growth, but it did lift sentiment indicators and the Trade Engine Score.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Sector Comparison, Fundamentals &amp; Technicals</strong></h3><p>Against the Information Technology sector backdrop, IBM’s profile shows contrasts. The sector PE (TTM) sits near <strong>23.16</strong>, and QoQ revenue growth averages about <strong>4.39%</strong>. IBM’s own comparative strengths include high profitability metrics — profitability score at <strong>84.11%</strong> and an earnings quality letter grade of <strong>A-</strong> with an earnings quality score of <strong>67.88</strong>. Growth is marked as a strength by the internal growth score of <strong>72.46%</strong>, while capital allocation is modest at <strong>24.20%</strong>.</p><p>Leverage is notable: a leverage score of <strong>90.75%</strong> signals higher-than-average balance-sheet gearing relative to peers. Net margin is shown as <strong>0.00%</strong> in the dataset; given IBM’s established profitability, that zero may reflect a data artefact or a specific metric definition and should be treated cautiously. Overall, the fundamental score of <strong>58.60</strong> is moderate — healthy profitability and growth offset by capital allocation and leverage concerns.</p><p>Technically, a <strong>50-day EMA of $267.97</strong> and a <strong>50-day SMA of $255.49</strong> place the current price well above short-term trend averages, confirming upward momentum. The technical score of <strong>60.91</strong> is consistent with a trend-confirmation phase rather than an exhausted run.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Analyst Sentiment &amp; News Synthesis</strong></h3><p>Analyst sentiment tilts constructive. The analyst score is <strong>85.71</strong> derived from 23 tracked analysts, with a mean target of <strong>$286.20</strong> and a median of <strong>$300.90</strong>. The current price of $308.21 sits above the mean and slightly above the median, indicating the market has priced in somewhat more optimism than the consensus target. Coverage counts in the dataset show a wide spread of ratings — many buy/hold/sell entries — reflecting a mixed but tilted buying bias in broader aggregates.</p><p>Recent news is limited but meaningful: a renewal and expansion of a partnership between IBM and Straker Limited (<strong>ASX:STG</strong>) highlights continued traction for IBM’s AI and language services ecosystem. That kind of commercial expansion supports the narrative of enterprise customers leaning on IBM’s AI-enabled offerings, which aligns with the revenue beat and elevated news sentiment score of <strong>77.00</strong>. The news probably reinforced short-term flows and helped the Trade Engine Score remain elevated.<br/> </p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>IBM’s current profile is one of momentum meeting measured fundamentals. The Trade Engine Score of <strong>69.70</strong> captures this mix: positive technicals and strong sentiment sit alongside moderate fundamental scores and elevated leverage. Recent earnings produced a slight revenue beat that likely accelerated buying into resistance near the 52-week high. Analyst targets cluster below the current price, indicating the market has already priced some optimism beyond consensus.</p><p>For readers, the key takeaway is that IBM is in a phase where news, momentum and earnings cadence are the primary drivers of near-term performance, while valuation and leverage remain the longer-term anchors. Monitor price behavior around the $319 area and any follow-up commentary on margins, capital allocation and large-scale partnerships that could materially shift the fundamental case.</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/meta-platforms-heads-into-earnings-with-ai-driven-ad-growth-and-tightened-power-competition?post=531397\">Meta Platforms Heads Into Earnings With AI-Driven Ad Growth And Tightened Power Competition</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/palantir-technologies-nears-record-high-after-lumen-ai-deal-and-defense-demonstrations?post=531081\">Palantir Technologies Nears Record High After Lumen AI Deal And Defense Demonstrations </a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/micron-technology-near-52-week-high-as-ai-demand-drives-momentum?post=530726\">Micron Technology Near 52-Week High As AI Demand Drives Momentum</a></p></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"tm-article_content\" id=\"blog-content\"><p>As expected, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its target rate cut by ¼ point to a 4.0%-to-4.25% range. The drop marks the second rate cut this year, following the drop in the policy rate in September. A third cut by 2025’s close, however, is less likely, according to Fed Chairman Powell.</p><p>“There were strongly differing views about how to proceed [at the next policy meeting] in December,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html\">said</a> during a news conference following the Fed’s rate-cut announcement. “A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.”</p><p>The bond market quickly took the hint and sold off, driving yields higher. The policy-sensitive 2-year rate, for example, shot up on Wednesday to 3.60%, a three-week high.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/two.yr_.30oct2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/two.yr_.30oct2025.png\" width=\"700\"/></a></p><p><br/><a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">Fed funds futures</a> are still pricing in moderately high odds that favor another rate cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, but the implied probability is 72%, which leaves room for debate about how the end of the year unfolds.</p><p>Part of the reasoning for possibly pausing on rate cuts is the delay in new economic reports due to the government shutdown. “What do you do if you’re driving the fog? You slow down,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/30/fed-cut-rates-officials-disagree-on-whats-next/86964505007/\">said</a>, referring to the postponed numbers, such as the monthly payrolls report for September which remains in hiatus.</p><p>The lack of new economic numbers is “very concerning,” former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/29/powell-cuts-interest-rates-employment-inflation-trump-incompetent/\">told</a> <em>Fortune, </em>noting that the Fed is “flying blind.” She explained: “If policymakers build systems around data that can vanish overnight, that’s a real vulnerability for economic governance.”</p><p>The special release of consumer inflation data for September showed headline CPI rising 3.0% year-over-year, the highest since January. But Powell expressed a degree of optimism that to the extent that pricing pressure is rising due to tariffs, it will be a one-time effect that won’t push up inflation much longer beyond what’s already been seen.</p><p>“Inflation away from tariffs is actually not so far from our 2% goal,” Powell <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0p7g7560o\">said</a>. He advised that central bankers are looking for signs that tariffs only lead to one-time price increases for certain consumer products.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty linked to delayed data, weakness in hiring will likely keep the Fed on a rate-cutting path, predicts Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. “The downside risks within the job market will likely ensure the Fed will continue to cut rates in December and throughout the next year,” he reasoned in a press release sent to CapitalSpectator.com.<br/> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed.30oct2025.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fed.30oct2025.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p><p><br/>The critical variable in the days and weeks ahead is how the Treasury market reacts. Was Wednesday’s rise in yields a one-off event? Or will the bond ghouls push yields higher and put more pressure on the Fed to forgo rate cuts?</p><hr/><p><em>More By This Author:</em></p><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/us-markets/macro-briefing-wednesday-oct-29?post=531436\">Macro Briefing - Wednesday, Oct. 29</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/foreign-stocks-still-on-track-to-outperform-us-in-2025?post=531382\">Foreign Stocks Still On Track To Outperform US In 2025</a><br/><a href=\"https://talkmarkets.com/content/etfs/macro-briefing-tuesday-oct-28?post=531130\">Macro Briefing - Tuesday, Oct. 28</a><br/></div>",
